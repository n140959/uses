000N5WPQY We have had this tiler for a few years now and since we were moving, just stored it until we were moved.  So, moving aside, we drug this thing out and guess what? It worked for a little bit then quit.  It wouldn't restart, and then the motor started smoking!  What a ridiculous machine!  SO wish I would have saved the money on this thing and bought the other tiller that's the Number 1 seller on amazon.  This thing is a total piece of junk!  And, I'm now out the $330 I paid for it.  Brother!
B000N5WPQY Yes, I use my Mantis tiller every day to loosen up my horse stalls.  Not typical use for a device like this, but it works fantastic.My horse stalls have a sand base, and running the tiller over them every day keeps the sand loose and the stalls fresh. I've been using this tiller in my stalls for several months now, and it's running like a champ. It gets the job done done quickly and better than I could do with a rake.
B000NCTGQE I bought this greenhouse to over-winter some not cold-hardy plants on my screened porch. It was easy to set up, although I managed to get the side supports upside down, once that was corrected, the finished product looked very nice. The shelves are rather flimsy but hold my plants with no problem. Even though the weather has only been cold enough lately to use the greenhouse a couple of nights, when I took the ferns out during the day I noticed how nice and warm it was inside. For my purpose the greenhouse works very well, the cover is fairly heavy, it fits good, the tubing feels strong and the pieces all fit together. I'm very happy with the greenhouse.
B000NCTGQE I use 2 of these with row cover cloth over them to shade my heat sensitive plants in the summer.  It's much more sturdy than I was led to believe by some of the other reviews.  We have pretty strong winds around here, and it doesn't phase it.  Granted I don't use the plastic covering.
B000NCTGQE I have one tomato plant and I use this mini greenhouse to keep it warm at night. ( I do not use the shelves)It has worked wellThe only issue is this.  During the day it gets too hot.  I would love to find a mini greenhouse like this with an automatic venting system. So if it gets too hot, the vent/fan turns on to remove hot airThe do have these types if venting systems for larger greenhouses so it can be done.
B000NCTGQE My husband put this shelving unit together in 20 minutes.  He added tie-ons around each tier shelf to keep them from moving around too much.  It's a handsome little thing but I can tell just by looking at it that it is not designed for long-term outdoor use.  Those reviewers who complain that it gets blown away in the wind are not using this for its intended use.  The intended use is as an indoor growing medium with supplemental light.  A heated garage, a sheltered patio or balcony or a sunny spot in a large kitchen would be ideal for this greenhouse and users could get many years of use from this thing.The connecting parts are plastic and when empty this greenhouse does not weight much (thus its \"portability\").  The lower end is open to air, so true humidity would be difficult to replicate.The \"plastic smell\" goes away when left out to ventilate a few days after set-up.I am happy with this little device.  Here in Arizona this covered shelving unit works to keep dust from getting on my garden tools in the off season.  In the dry, windy springs here, though, this thing wouldn't stand a chance of lasting long outdoors in the direct sun.
B000NCTGQE Although the construction of this \"greenhouse\" is somewhat flimsy, with 1/2\" metal tubular supports and wire shelves, it works well as a temporary shelter/space for plants, as long as you don't expect to keep plants warm during frosty nights.  I use mine indoors during the end of winter for starting seeds, then move it outside as the weather gets better.This shelving unit comes with a plastic tent with a zippered door that fits over the frame; the door can be rolled up to cool the interior or to access the plants.  Because the tent is relatively thin plastic (think suit-bag on steroids) and not glass, it heats up in the sunlight but immediately loses its heat as the sun sets, unlike greenhouses that are flush to the ground and have thicker glass/plastic walls to retain the heat longer.  If you still have temperatures in the thirties or forties at night and expect to grow warm weather plants like tomatoes outside, use plant heating pads or keep the unit inside until you can be sure that the cold nights won't stunt the plants.  If you do get an unexpected light frost, however, the plastic works like a row cover, keeping frost from the leaves.  If using outside, place it in a protected spot or anchor it in some fashion -- preferably both.  Even loaded with plants, the unit can blow over, especially with the tent in place since it can act like a sail.With the plastic in place, the top shelf is difficult to access, particularly toward the back because rolled-up the tent door and overhang get in the way.  The other three shelves (12-13\" between each) have plenty of clearance, and all four have room for 2-3 large seed trays.  Grow lights (not included) can be attached without much effort, provided, of course, that they are the right size.  The wire shelves are not attached to the frame - they sit on top of the cross-supports - but will stay in place during light winds as long as plants are on them.As long as you don't expect heavy-duty construction and heat retainment for cold nights, this shelving unit should serve well for seed starting or even for a display of small plants.  I don't find it attractive enough for a permanent plant stand for inside the house, but luckily it's lightweight enough to easily move around and store.  I find this perfect for starting my garden indoors and then using it to harden off my plants.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann
B000NCTGQE I already have a couple of these that I've been using for years.  The units hold up well, but the covers don't hold up as long.  I don't use them to start my plants in.  I do that inside with heated mats and overhead lighting that can be adjusted.  I use these racks to harden off my seedlings prior to planting or hold plants I've purchased until planting time.  If you start your own tomato, pepper and other plants from seed, they can gradually acclimate to living outdoors using these handy racks.Only the top shelves will accomdate taller plants, but my seedlings are planted in the garden before they get too tall.  Sometimes I've needed the height if I purchased plants that were already quite tall.Most of my vegetable gardening is done in earthboxes.  We have a serious squirrel and slightly lessor rabbit problem in our area.  The squirrels will continually dig whereever I've planted things and the birds will quickly grab any seeds that are exposed.They destroyed all of the snap peas I planted a couple of weeks ago.  Only one seedling survived their havoc.  The other day I discovered that the shelves from these racks fit nicely over an earthbox.  The mesh openings are small enough to keep the squirrels and birds from digging up the seeds before they germinate.  I simply laid the mesh shelf over the top of the earthbox and secured it into place.  The soil level is a couple of inches lower and the seedlings can either grow through the mesh or I can simply remove the shelf once they've established themselves.I am considering buying another unit just for the mesh shelves.  I direct seed things like cucumbers, beans, peas, radishes and squash in the earthboxes and often have to plant multiple times before I have enough growing.  These shelves should solve that problem.For hardening off seedlings, I only close the covers if we expect a cool night and my racks are used on a covered front porch and against the back of the house.  I position them so they are less susceptable to wind to help sheild the plants from cold wind and keep them from blowing over.  After a brief period, I bring the plants out of the unit for gradually increasing lengths of time so they get a little wind and the stems get sturdy.  You do need to shift the plants because they will always grow toward the light and they need fresh air and wind to become strong enough to survive in the garden.Those who have had trouble with plants wilting due to too much moisture need to give the plants more access to fresh air and air circulation.  Just remove the cover when the temps allow it or remove the trays of plants for a few hours a day.
B000NCTGQE You probably need to make a few adjustments.  Firstly, the wire shelving does not snap into place so sliding a tray on the wire shelf would cause the entire shelf to fall off the railing.  I used locking ties to affix the shelves to the rail apparatus to prevent the shelves from sliding off. Also,  I would prefer the zipper to go both from top and bottom rather than just he bottom. If you have to water on the top shelf, you have to unzip the entire thing.  But good anyway.
B000NCTGQE We purchased two of these. We were excited to get them quickly and we put them together with no problems. We knew they weren't going to be the highest quality, but we thought they would do the job. We put a total of 6 small plants (herbs and vegetable seedlings) split between the 2 greenhouses. We also put things like our small shovel, empty watering can, and bag of soil on the bottom shelves. There is no recommended maximum weight listed on the product listing, the box, or the directions. We figured we should be okay since we had much less than what is pictured on the box and also on the product listing here.Not even 24 hours after setting these up both crashed to the ground. Pots broke, plants were tossed upside down, and everything was a mess. It was difficult to get everything out safely since the plastic was zipped up and the opening was facing the ground. Once we got everything out, we noticed the plastic supports on both of our greenhouses broke. They could not hold the weight. That is unfortunate considering there wasn't that much sitting in the greenhouse to begin with.We will definitely be returning both of these.I wouldn't bother wasting your money on this. We've decided to spend a little more and get a heavy duty rack like this one:Seville Classics SHE18487 18-Inch by 48-Inch by 72-Inch Shelving System with Wheels, Chromeand then wrap heavy duty plastic around the back and sides. For the front, we are going to attach a second piece of plastic with velcro so it is removable. Same effect, but at least we can be certain it won't come crashing down.--In case this review doesn't scare you away and you are still curious about the dimensions between the shelves:-There is 12.5\" between each shelf.-The top shelf has 20.5\" of space at it's highest point.If you are having trouble keeping the wire shelves flat across the supports, you can bend them slightly downward so they fit better. This stopped ours from moving around so much....well before they came crashing down. :/
B000NCTGQE I used this greenhouse this spring.  We had a long wet/ cold spring this year.  I was happy to have somewhere for my seedlings but there are several things I do not like about this product and I do not plan to buy another.Pros -*Works well to protect seedlings from wind and excess rain if monitored*Easy to assemble*Inexpensive*Nice lookingCons -*Forget using the wheels unless your surface is smooth.  My older deck was too rough and the tiny wheels kept getting stuck*Easy assembly yes, but also easy disassembly.  Every time you move the thing it falls apart no matter how well you think you have forced the pieces together.  I also had to use some electrical tape to tape the shelves in place as they just sit on the rails and will fall off, damaging plants below.*With no vents it can go from warm to plant killing heat in just a few minutes if the sun comes out unexpectedly.  I used a wireless thermometer to monitor it constantly.  I finally cut a 6 x 8\" vent on either side of the top where the heat built up the most.  I left the flaps hanging and tucked them up when it was warm.*If it is really cold the plants have to be brought into the house.  This unit is so small and the plastic doesn't go all the way to the ground there is no way it will actually hold heat overnight, something owners of even larger 'real' greenhouses struggle to do.In summary - I previously had an 8 x 10 actual greenhouse but have recently moved and needed something cheap and quick.  This fit the bill. After using it for 3 months the plastic around the zippers is starting to come loose.  I monitored it continuesly as to the temperature, opening and closing the front flap and my home made vents as needed.  Everytime I left the house for an extended period I had to decide if I wanted to just put the plants out on the table and risk cold damage or leave them in the greenhouse and risk heat damage.  This is a useful item but is very time consuming to make the best use of.  The quality is ok.  Originally I was planning to break it down for easy storage in the summer but now I think I will permenently glue the joints and store it fully assembled so it isn't falling apart on me.  Either way in one more season I am sure it will be shot and then I plan to purchase another 'real' greenhouse or use high tunnels.
B000NCTGQE I don't know what the negative posters are talking about.  It took me 5 minutes to assemble this greenhouse and place it on my pool patio.  I've started two generations of seeds in this greenhouse without any problems.  The shelving is metal, the frame is heavy duty plastic with metal parts, and the cover fits perfectly.  It is a very lightweight unit so I wouldn't recommend putting it in an area where you'd be encountering wind gusts since it might tip over.  However, that's just common sense, or so I thought until I read the reviews here.Good product, decent prices, easy assembly, 5 stars.... and I just purchased another right before leaving this review.
B000NCTGQE There's frost danger in our mountains until mid-May. We're at 5,500 feet, and it gets hot in summer (up to 100F), but the growing season isn't that long. If you want tomatoes and more that will finish producing before the temp. plunges below freezing again, you either pay for plants a couple of feet tall - or you grow your own from seed.We've begun to grow both veggies and flowers from seed, and we've set up a \"sprouting station\" with a heated warming pad under a fluorescent grown light (I've reviewed them separately). We use Jiffy trays of 72 peat pellets each, that come with their own tray and see-through plastic top. But what would we do would we do with those flats of pretty green heads once up?The answer was this greenhouse. We set it up indoors, in front of the fixed section of a sliding glass door. Some daylight gets to it, but it needed more light, so I rigged it with 2ft. fluorescent \"under-counter\" lights, purchased elsewhere. That doubled the cost, but it made the unit self sufficient.Overall, the shelving unit is a little lightweight - but then again, it had to be designed to ship in a box for a reasonable cost. Once here, it was easy to figure out and put together - took maybe twenty minutes tops. The greenhouse is 2'3\" wide by 1'7\" deep. It's just over 5' high. That sounds pretty small, but in fact, it holds a lot. We've got basil, parsley, cilantro and more growing, and the greenhouse holds eight herb-size pots to a shelf. Or you can (just) fit two Jiffy 72-pellet trays on one shelf.The shelves themselves are wire mesh, and not fixed down, so I used plastic zip-ties to hold them in place.The clear plastic cover is pretty easy to slip over the unit, and the 2 x zippers are decent quality.I held back 1 star for these reasons: while most of the structure is metal rods, the end pieces are molded plastic. With our herb pots on the shelves, they bow a little in the middle. I'll probably end up cutting dowel to shore up each shelf. The manufacturer should think about beefing up those end pieces.Also, some worker half way around the world must have had a bad day while sewing our slip-over plastic cover - the seam on the front is crooked. Not bad enough for us to return it, but that's what we see every time we look at it. The clear plastic (or vinyl?) cover itself could have also been a heavier material.Those are quibbles. Overall, this greenhouse priced under $50 is one of the most reasonable out there. It is what it claims to be - a cute, tight unit.Recommended.
B000NCTGQE I bought this thinking it would be kind of cool to grow some smaller plants and flowers on but was disappointed... Though it it was easy to assemble.For outside use-  Without a sturdy background AND screwing it in for support this greenhouse design will fall over with even the smallest gusts of wind destroying all your plants... yes it happened to me, but i was able to salvage and retransfer a few of my starts.-During the summer months if you keep the flap closed the plants will not get nearly enough oxygen and die.  Also, in summer even with flap open I recorded heat in excess of 110degF causing serious wilting.For inside use-  Pretty much can only be used as a display for small flowers or to start plants in a tray (seed dome only fits in top tier) but kind of looks like crap with any kind furniture you might put in a room.All in all- Not a good buy unless you want a slightly hideous plant display or just want to look like you grow plants in a &#34;greenhouse&#34;.
B000NCUW1M I've used this stuff for years.  You have to be patient with it, as unnerving as it can be to watch the little critters march across your floors/counters.  How long it takes all depends on the size of the colony I assume.  The problem at my previous residence took almost 2 weeks to clear up (They seriously slowed down after the first few days).  The ants at my current one took &#60;3 days.  I don't use the &#34;spots&#34; they provide.  I use a larger piece of cardboard and put individual drops all over it.  You want the most &#34;edge&#34; area for the ants to feed from, so one big pool doesn't work.  Check your spots often to make sure they don't eat it all and wander off to find alternate food...make sure you keep it like a buffet, always full!  Although you don't want anyone to ingest it, as far as poisons go....I feel fairly comfortable having it around.
B000NCUW1M Every few years we get invaded on our hill top by tiny ants. All the neighbors tried different things and it didn't stop it. Then one got terro several years ago and bam. So we all now use it. This year, lots of rain and sure enough, they are back. Used it for a week and no more ants. I have even used in my car when they invade the car. I put it in tiny plastic lids instead of on the tear off paper (not such a good idea but product so great, won't remove a star.. just save flatter type lids).
B000NCUW1M We had little Pharaoh ants in our RV.  I tried other baits and few home made ant killers.  These little Pharaoh ants had a picnic.  I bought this Terro and the party was over!  The ants formed a heavy line and in a day or two they were gone!  Be sure and keep them supplied with bait until they stop coming.Recommended!
B000NCUW1M Been using this for years and it is great stuff. Only issue is it dries up in a couple of days so you need to refresh the area.
B000NCUW1M Here we are in the middle of a major drought in Indiana and the only thing that is multiplying is the ants!  They are just thriving in the heat and they are everywhere.  If I set out food for the other animals the ants are all over it in minutes and they devour everything.  This product is a sure thing, it doesn't kill the ants in your home, it kills the nest and it is gone.I was unfamiliar with this product a few years ago and now I use it every year.  We found a few ants in our kitchen and they were so small that they were crawling under the door seal.  I got some Terro liquid and put a small drop on a few pieces of thin cardboard and placed them in the path of the incoming ants.  They immediately found it and within a few minutes hundreds of them were enjoying the bait.  They eat their fill and then take some back to share with the colony.  They even share it with the Queen (Which is really your target) and within a few days to a few weeks the colony is gone (Depending on its size).  The ants that eat it die within 24 to 48 hours and they are sharing it with other ants.  Don't disturb the bait and only replenish it if it becomes hard or they have consumed it all.  Just add a few drops and in hot weather, do this in the morning and at night.  The ants that find the bait leave an odor trail and this leads the other ants to the bait so don't move the bait.Terro also makes liquid ant bait traps that are prefilled and ready to use.  They feed the ants but protect the bait from the elements and it prevents the bait from drying out.  Leave the Terro in place for 3 or 4 days so you don't see any more ants and then you can dispose of it.  Terro is safe to use around pets and children and its active ingredient is Borax which is already used in many household products.This product works and it does its job quickly and safely.  It works both inside and outside and within 4 days you should begin to see the difference.  I believe in this product and I strongly recommend it to you!
B000NCUW1M I'm so happy they just sell the liquid.  Their ant killer is the best but I had switched to Combat's gel (in the syringe-looking thing) because the little bait stations Terro usually has available are dumb.  Ants NEVER go in them.  I have always just dumped the liquid out of them and threw out the plastic station.  Now I don't have to bother with that and I can put this anywhere!  I will say that this is a liquid and will run if you use it vertically.  The Combat gel can go on a wall without issue.
B000NCUW1M This is the most amazing product that I have used.  I put in it two areas where I either knew or suspected that there were ants inside my house.  Within 15-20 minutes, there were hundreds of them in a feeding frenzy.  The secret is to resist the temptation to spray them, since they eventually head back to the nest where apparently they infect others and where they all die.  So far, it has taken a little less than 3 days for the hundreds to drop down to a handful. Some didn't make it back to the nest. This is clearly a very effective product. You can get it for $2 and change at your local hardware store.
B000NCUW1M Living in New Mexico, we have lots of ants. We have used Terro for years now. We use it where ants are active and always put it on the floor. Don't put it on your counters. Perhaps we have many ants because last year we went through FOUR bottles of Terro and still had ants. It at least keeps them busy and in one place. They are very attracted to this formula. Whether or not it has been taken back to the nest and killed off any colonies, I don't know. I found that the traps sometimes will dry up before the ants can empty them, so I prefer the bottled liquid so it can be doled out as needed.
B000NCUW1M I can't tell but it does not seem to kill them.,...they swarm to eat it but they keep coming back !!
B000NCUW1M When I see ants swarming in the house, my natural reaction is to spray them with a diluted soap solution, which kills them almost immediately.Using a product like Terro Liquid Ant Killer, requires suppressing my \"kill immediately\" mindset and taking a long term approach.  The very best case scenario is that the foraging worker ants will consume the ant killer, and take it back to the colony, where it is consumed by the Queen ant.  When she dies, the colony will become crippled and die out.It sounds great in theory, and every species of ant I have encountered seems to love drinking this liquid.  It's very cool watching the ants maniacally feed, but how likely is it really that the poisonous solution will find its way back to her royal highness?  Probably, very, very, low.Many ant colonies are quite intensive, span large areas, can contain millions of ants, and some even have several queens.  Believing that the few ants consuming the poison, will fortuitously also feed and kill the Queen, is quite a long shot.  Logically the more ants that drink the poison, the greater the odds of success.  So infecting as many ants as possible makes sense, however that is a little challenging when the product is being sold in one or two ounce bottles, and administered by the drop.  It just doesn't seem very efficient, or provide the necessary coverage to poison enough ants.I live in a temperate part of the country, and have four or five different species of ants constantly battling for territory in my yard.  They are basically everywhere there is soil.  Having used this product and similar liquid ant baits, many, many times, I have yet to see it successfully wipe out a colony.The ingredients listed on the label are \"Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate (Borax) 5.4%\", and \"Other Ingredients: 94.6%\".  Assuming the costs are nominal for these ingredients, the percentage of profit on a product like this must be astronomical.  If liquid ant killer was sold by the pint instead of by the ounce, at a price closer to actual costs, with a more efficient system of distributing the poison (traps or other dispensers), I suspect the product would have a much higher rate of success.  But of course, that would be financial suicide for Terro, who make no promises regarding success.  Consider this, at the retail cost of $6.50 for two ounces, Terro Ant Killer costs about $416 per gallon (128 ounces).  At the price for the one ounce bottle ($4.27), a gallon costs $544.  This stuff is not cheap!I use the product occasionally, with the hope that maybe just once I will get lucky and wipe out a colony.  Seeing the ants literally crawl over each other to guzzle down the stuff, feeds my fantasy that this will be the time the deadly elixir makes its way down through the depths of the colony, to the Queen's lips (sorry, mandibles), and she will meet a tragic end.  No luck so far.Ant bait does work, however what appears to be missing is some honest, accurate data about how much liquid, and how many ants may need to be poisoned, to stand a good chance of taking out a colony.  If as I suspect, both numbers are quite substantial, that information probably won't be forthcoming from Terro anytime soon.
B000NCWOKE I purchased this hose because I wanted a lightweight weigh hose I could maneuver around.  I also was more interested in pressure than volume.  I have been very pleased.  The hose is kink resistant and solidly built.  I highly recomend.
B000NCWOKE I have purchased four of these Gilmour 10 series hoses over the last three years, two are still working. The manufacturer specifies a lifetime warranty on their web page, but no-one from the company has ever replied to my emails. We have 3 hoses in the back garden, the third is a Flexon, which so far has outlasted two of the more expensive Gilmours, and it's a lot lighter.
B000NCWOKE I love this hose.  It replaced my HEAVY one inch hose that was hard to pull through my long yard.  This one is a joy to use, so easy to maneuver.  Will purchase again if necessary.
B000NCWOKE I demand a lot out of my hoses, and in spring/summer have 2 100-foot hoses + 1 50-foot hose running from the house to our raised-bed vegetable garden.Well, I didn't even start the garden yet but had the hose fail on me. I left if on for a couple hours but had the nozzle off from the sprayer. The hoses I had last year never had an issue in this state.But after just two hours, the Flexogen hose was spraying water from the part that connects to the faucet. I'll be able to patch it and use it with our rain barrel but it disappointed me.
B000NCWOKE I went for this because of price. My mistake, it kinks and the kinks turn into squeezed shut areas that have to be worked back to open flo. Never will buy again.
B000NCWOKE Length and 8-ply construction of this rugged hose means that it will swerve you for many years. As such, it is a better investment than buying a 2-ply or 4-ply hose!  Length is ideal for use in any corner of my yard.  Couplings are tightly fastened.  Well-constructed!
B000NCWP44 Have really held up.  Much better than the washers I bought at the local hardware store, although you'd never know by looking at them.
B000NCWP44 What a difference a washer makes! It turned my leaky spitting garden hose into a well behaved no leak hose!  These washes are made from high quality rubber.  They are easy to install and fit the hose perfectly.  They are more expensive than the cheap washers that you can pick up at a home improvement store for a couple of bucks, but I think they will last longer and in the long run will not be more expensive. I have hard water and had to replace the flimsy washers every year.
B000NCWP44 Something that always gets lost and you need to have extras on hand when they get hard and useless. Or you risk getting very wet every time you hand water anything. A must have for homeowners with large yards
B000NCWP44 Must have washers for your hose and attachments as they all eventually begin to degrade.  Nice pack of seemingly quality washers for a good price.
B000NCWP44 These seem to work very well.  They are a lot snugger than the plastic(?) washer that came with my spray nozzle, and they have more depth and \"cushion\" than the old one.  I don't think I'll have any problem with leaks now.
B000NCWP44 What can I say, rubber hose washers, they work just fine.  This is hard to give rate reasons as they are just washers.
B000NCWP44 Came with 10 washers, at well less then 4 bucks its a great deal. I had a pack of these before that lasted about 6 years until I lost them, so I'm certain the rubber will stay good at least that long when stored. I've only used 2 of these but so far both the hoses don't have any leaks.
B000NCWP44 There seems to be a softer quality to this rubber that makes for a far superior seal with no leaks, as opposed to products that appear very similar but are harder and don't seal as well.
B000NCWP44 great deal stops leaking water hoses. very fast shipping. working great so far. great price. will order again when I need them. thanks.
B000NCWP44 I have been using Gilmore washers for quite some time now and of all the washers I've dealt with over the years this brand is consistently the best.  Now unlike some folks who have one or two hoses hooked up and connected, I have the things running all over the place.  We have a very large vegetable garden, a large number of flower gardens, orchard and grape vines.  We do A LOT of watering.Now some of our gardens, trees, etc. are located quite a distance from our various outlets.  Folks, we are talking four acres here with stuff that needs watering all over the place.  This requires multiple hose connections.  Now I have found that when I have a leak near the joint or main connection that in 99 percent of the time is requires a washer replacement.  The thing is, washers wear out, especially if you leave the hoses out year around like we do.  I make it a practice to replace all washers each spring.  This saves me a lot of frustration and hassle during the main growing portion of the year.Please note that if you run over the end of your hoses or hose joints with a car, tractor or lawn tractor, a washer will not normally fix the situation.  Nor, I fear to tell you, if you accidently burn your hose while burning leaves and brush, will a washer fix the problem...trust me...I know about stuff like that.The price here for a package of ten washers is quite competitive.  I pay more at local stores.  I will start ordering these things from Amazon as it will save me some bucks so I can replace burned hoses.Anyway, when you buy a new hose, check it out.  You will almost always find one of those little plastic washers either in the end or wired to the hose.  If you want my recommendation, you will get rid of the plastic washer and replace it with one of these Gilmores...you are going to have to do it anyway very soon so you might save yourself the headache.I always keep an extra pack or two of these around as I have little patients and when I need a washer, I need a washer now!This is a good buy and as a Prime member, I get free shipping which makes it even better!Don BlankenshipThe ozarks
B000NCWP44 I had the black washer in my garden hose and spray nozzle that came with them when purchased. They both leaked, so I purchased these red ones. They stopped both the leakes and I've not had any leaks from either one. I'm very satisfied, so far.
B000NCWP44 What can you say about them they do the job and must be used to keep your water where it needs to be and to keep you dry. theese are very good,thicker than others i have purchased I would recommend these!
B000NCWP44 I had no idea that the a good washer could make the difference.  They are very large and sturdy and actually fit our hose beautifully.  These are not the cheap, hard plastic washers you find other places.  These beauties really work and no more leaks.
B000NCWP44 Not much to comment on gaskets except that they serve there purpose in our garden hoses.  Somewhat larger than those you buy at a discount store.
B000NCWP44 These washers are an add-on item which means they ship free with a $25.00 order. There are 10 red washers in the plastic bag at a cost of $3.98 for the 10 of them. They are the exact size as the black washers that come with the Gilmour solid brass hose connectors that are known to cause cancer according to the state of California. These washers are made in China as are the Gilmour hose connectors for which I bought the washers. There is no cancer warning on the red washers. Replacing the washers is a very easy task. They do a good job of stopping leaks.
B000NCWP44 These washers are an excellent fit for my 5/8-inch hose ends. Old washers do tend to dry out regularly and the fact that Amazon carries these washers makes it much easier to replace them as needed.
B000NCWP44 bought these for my non heavy duty hoses that didn't have washers built in.these performed exactly as i wanted/expected.  leaks stopped, but functionality remained.perfect.
B000NCWP44 They seal just like they are supposed to and so far I haven't had any leaks. Right price, product as described.
B000NCWP44 You can't beat these red rubber washers. They seal so much better than the black O-Ring style. At least I have found them to be far superior.
B000NCWP44 Excellent hose washers, far superior to the cheap plastic &#34;washers&#34; found at box stores. I will definitely consider buying these again when the time comes (in a few years or so).
B000NCWP44 It is always good to have a couple of these as spares. They fit nice and snug in the hose that for the price I always replace them every other year or so.
B000NCWP44 Sometimes improvements don't have to be fancy & expensive - like these Gilmour washers.  Over the years it seems like every time I use my hose for something I end up wet in one manner or another.  All my hoses and connector nozzles have leaks at the connector point - if I'm lucky the leak sprays harmless away from me but alas about half the time I take one in the eye, pants, shoes, etc.  I still remember the time I got a good soaking in the upper front part of my pants right before company came over...I used to think the problem was in the nozzles so I would replace them more frequently than I probably should have (at $10+ per pop).  However, even the new nozzles leaked and sprayed me in the eyes/pants/shoes/etc.  Over the years it dawned on me (I'm not that bright) that it's  not the nozzle but probably just needs better washer sealing.  I knew what to do next  -> Amazon.com ->  search ->  garden washer ->  read user reviews ->  Gilmour Hose Washers.I'm glad to report that these washers work as advertised and can't beat the price (vs buying new nozzles).  No more leaks/soakings.  I've found I do need more washers than hoses - I insert mine in the nozzle heads and I've got more nozzles than hoses. 
B000NCWP44 I didn't intend to purchase these, but ended up buying them based on an amazon recommendation. I didn't realize how much I needed these and have been very satisfied stopping all leaks in my hoses and attachments.
B000NCWP44 This is a pretty handy pack of washers to have around, they are probably going to work better for you then any washer included in a new garden hose or garden sprayer.  Works even better if you put a thin layer of teflon-based lubricant on it like Magic Lube or something similar.  Prevents leaks.
B000NCWP44 I tried yellow plastic washers and a quick connect set purchased at Lowes, they didn't work. Despairing of finding a solution, I put this washer in yesterday. Success! No leaks when turned on hose. Hoping for best.Update 9/27/12 Still no leaks!
B000NCWP44 use these to replace all the old ones that leak or are disintegrated. used for hose and hose connections  great with add on
B000NCWP44 Hard to say too much about these simple little washers.  Replace the crap vinyl ones you usually get in hoses and attachements with good quality washers and fix those leaky joints.  I order several packs of these just to make sure I can find them when I want them.  It's the little things in life that you appreciate....
B000NCWP44 They were ok, but the bag was torn open with one missing when I located it inside the box. Never had that happen before or since at Amazon.
B000NCWP44 These are for 3/4 garden hose and if your like me it's easier to change them than have a leak.  These are a little thin but still work well, I have needed to double them up once, because they were so thin.
B000NCWP44 Cannot beat the price, they do what they are designed for and they are durable.I have used and re-used these washers on multiple hoses and sprinklers.
B000NCWP44 I used a washer to stop a leaky hose connection and it worked. The leak is now between the hose female end and the connection to the hose. I don't think there is a fix for that leak except buy a new hose. The rubber washers work.
B000NCWP44 These are the best I have gotten. They are thick enough not to squash easily and they are flexible enough to fill uneven spots on older faucets. I never have to get out the pliers to stop a leak. I always keep some around. There really is no disadvantage to them at all. I buy a set whenever I buy any hose related Gilmour item so that I can replace the junky ones that come standard with them and make installation easier. You should get these.
B000NCWP44 Basically these are red rubber washers like the ones that were used years ago. They work fine. Many products made today come with those plastic washers. I find that the plastic ones allow the fitting to loosen up on its own, which is very annoying.
B000NCWP44 These are made of good quality rubber so they should function very well and last for a long time to come
B000NCWP44 replaced one 2day on the 2nd of 2 ordered Gilmour* Platinum hoses from last year - should have sent that back. Now to 'crack of' the collar' to hopefully get problem fixed as this not a solution -Gilmour 20-58075 20 Series 8-Ply 5/8-Inch-by-75-Foot Flexogen Hose, Platinum
B000NCWP44 These washers fit perfectly and snuggly in your hose and nozzle as needed.  I had to use a flat blade screwdriver to firmly fit the washer in place.  That way it was tightly in place.  It keeps leaks from occurring at the spigot and at the nozzle.
B000NCWP44 If you use garden hoses, then you will eventually need these. The provider washers wear out or get lost. These are a cheap solution.
B000NCWP44 Though these washers work better than any others I've used, I would still like to see a softer washer become available. I have a lot of hoses and it would be so much nicer if I didn't have to turn the hose ends together with such force to get a good connection. I'm constantly moving hoses and changing lengths. Someone should make a good soft rubber washer. If anyone one knows of some, let me know.
B000NCWP44 These are excellent little washers. We do a lot of watering here in the desert and the sun is out from about 6AM to 9PM so washers take a beating and we replace most every year. However, why anyone would pay about 10 bucks (Amazon's price when this review was orginally posted) for hose washers is beyond me.I just purchased a few packs of these now that the price has dropped to a little over 2 bucks... Amazon price on 5/11/12 was 2.22 per 10-pack. The price difference may not seem like much but I recently purchased a 50 pack on eBay for 8.38 so that's under 2 bucks per 10 pack and that's a whole lot of washers.This is a good cart filler if you're a few bucks under 25 and these are great washers. Heavy duty rubber has lasted me longer than the plastic and other types of washers that come with most hoses and attachments. We have about 24 connections that require washers because we pump from a canal, water from field hydrants and also use several hose bibs on the house. It's hot here, the wind blows hard frequently, there's no humidity and all that adds us to a fast dry in the gardens and yard. We hate to waste water so spending a few bucks on washer, especially the Gilmour rubber ones, is much better than the water loss from the collective drips from inferior washers. However, even these do get a permanent crease that hot metal on the hose ends and the faucets will leave and though they don't leak they are hard to reuse the next season.
B000NCWP44 The important thing is the fact that they are rubber, not stamped-out cheap plastic.  They'll actually what they are supposed to do, and they'll last a lot longer than the cheap plastic junk.
B000NCWP44 I purchased a hose at wal mart and someone must have jacked the rings out of it. I plopped these in and it worked like a charm.
B000NCWP44 I am very glad to have these as &#34;back-ups&#34; for the usually cheap and thin one that comes with most hoses.  I used one on top of the one the hose had, and there is absolutely no leaking when watering my plants.  Love them and a very inexpensive solution.
B000NCWP44 Best use for auto irrigation projects.  No leaks secure the in near home prevents leaks to basement.Always have these available for projects where pressure finds its way past cheap washers. Well made and thicker.This brand and type best
B000NCWP44 These are good quality washers that are very well made. I bought these to replace some cracked washers of my garden hose. These are much better quality than the original ones that came with the hose.
B000NCWP44 Who can't use some extra washers; I can never seem to find mine when I really need one.  So I have this item on my Wish List to use whenever I need some extra amount to bring my order total up to the &#34;free shipping&#34; limit.  It is perfect for this.
B000ND3MGS This plant has been both more cold resistant and more pest resistant than the two dwarf cavendish banana plants growing in the same microclimate.  I bought the two cavendish plants at Home Depot with about eight leaves and about two feet high a week or two after I got this tiny nanner with four itsy bitsy leaves on it and they are all about the same size now.  We had two near-frosts that took a toll on the two others, but this plant never blinked at the cool weather.  So far so good.  It is now about three feet tall with no brown spots or blemishes of any kind, and no pest problems.  By comparison, the two dwarf cavendish plants always have at least a few leaves with brown spots on them no matter how often I care for them.  No fruit from any of them yet, but all things in their time. :)
B000ND3MGS Update: 8/30/2013:--------------------------------Plant has been dead for some time now.Update: 7/03/2013:--------------------------------This plant is just about completely dead now.Update: 1/13/2013:--------------------------------I managed to save the first plant, but I noticed a few days later after I've gotten the plant I noticed it was infested with spider mites. I used an insecticide on the plant, but it appears they already did damage to the plant. They were not discovered at first because they were all down inside the base of the plant. I suggest the seller (9GreenBox) to use insecticide on them ASAP.The insecticide I used isSafer Brand 5118 Insect Killing Soap - 16-Ounce Concentrate. It seemed to work on the first use, you should do it twice just to be sure none survived. If you're not sure if you have any you can look for small dots on your plant, move the leaf some and see if they move. If you're still not sure you can use a insecticide anyway.Also keep in mind this plant does NOT produce bananas. The image for the product is misleading. Any fruit it does produce is completely inedible, I'm not sure if the fruit will harm animals. I plan on picking them off and throwing them away just to be sure because I have three dogs.I've since then transplanted both of the trees into aSmart Pots 3-Gallon Smart Pot Soft-Sided Container, Tansince my last review. I used soil from my garden, yes it was not a \"great\" thing to do. But with the smart pot it seems to be doing good with it. Because the soil can get muddy when I water the tree it seems to do good with watering once a week. The only problem I have is with the first tree which was infested with spider mites.Keep in mind both trees came almost dead. But after a week or two of care it seems to come back and starts producing more leaves.For those of you that change your mind about keeping this plant you can grow it to the first flowering stage and get about $50 for it locally. If you let it flower fully then you can get about $110 for it.-------------------------------------------------------------------------Below is line is the old review-------------------------------------------------------------------------The I got the plant today, the leaves seem like their dying from the shipment. I'm giving it some emergency care to see if I can save it, two of the leaves were completely dead. I have it under a special light which acts like the sun. It's also in controlled heating at 80F.I suggest you expedite the shipping if you buy this, might be dead if you wait a week.Also, it seems like a second tree is starting to come up in the pot. I don't want to do any transplanting from the original pot until it's more healthy.I also have some organic fertilizer coming which I'm going to use on it.I'll update this review if I'm able to save it.
B000ND3MGS First of all, I can't believe these things survive the shipping process.Got mine about 3 weeks ago.  It was packed pretty well, but it was obvious one of the leaves wasn't very happy.  I transplanted it into a bigger pot after 3 days and put it outside where it gets full sun.  I have two new leaves already.  We'll see how it survives through the Oregon winter, but so far so good.  No complaints.Update 12/28/12: well this little guy survived through the first OR winter so I took it out of its pot and stuck it directly into the ground last spring.  I was getting about one new leaf per week during the height of the summer growing season and the plant is about 3 feet tall now.  It is now set to go for its second OR winter.Update 5/27/13: the 2nd OR winter didn't go so well.  We had a week where temps dropped into the teens and the ground was frozen.  That killed the plant since I hadn't mulched the ground or done any prep work to keep it warm, such as wrapping it with burlap.  I cut the plant at the base thinking I needed to start over, but much to my surprise, three new plants poked their heads out of the ground as soon as the soil warmed up in March.  They're now about a foot tall each and it will take a while for them to reach the stature of their Mom, but I'm thankful to have my plants back.  I will definitely take better care of them come next winter.
B000ND3MGS This thing has done great so far. It survived the winter well indoors. I may plant it in the backyard this year and see how hardy it really is.
B000ND3MGS Hirts sent me a nice baby banana tree, in a four inch pot. When I got it, it did look small, with an outer leaf that looked brownish, and half dead. There was a leaf growing out of the middle, tho. Within a few days of receiving the tree, I transplanted it into a  larger growers pot, using very free draining soil. (Use palm soil, which is like cactus soil, or mix together potting soil, vermiculite, perlite, and turface if you have it too). This creates a very loose soil, for fast root development. Also, fertilize your banana tree quite a bit, but don't burnt the tree. Use a balanced fertilizer, 10-10-10. Keep it in the sun, and keep it warm.  I would take the plant outside when the days would go up into the 60s, and take it inside at night, when the springtime tempertures dropped into the 30s and 40s.  During this first month, the banana tree grew like crazy. The leaf that looked brownish, just dropped away. These plants grow VERY fact at first, in order to develop its &#34;trunk&#34;.  New leaves come out of the center of the plant, unroll, and stretch out, each one bigger, and thicker, than the previous one.  Now its about 5 weeks after ordering, and I'd say it doubled in size easy.  The 6 inch pot I have it in, is basically too small for the banana palm tree.  I've been busy, fixing the banana tree a permanent home in my yard, while it's enjoying its childhood in the 6&#34; pot.The location of your banana tree is important.  It should get as much sun as possible, tho be protected from harsh winter north winds.  These trees need mulched for winter, and the internet has a lot of websites, and Utoob videos, to show how this is done. I dug up the soil, in a 3 foot radius, adding a lot of organic mulch to the soil, along with a bag of manure. These banana palms require a LOT of food, and a LOT of water, in order to make these huge growth spurts. Only now, in late May, can I even hope to plant this tree in the ground. (I live in region 5.) You need to wait til the nights warm up, and all danger of frost is past, to plant these.  If its down in the 40s at night, it wont kill the tree, but it just wont grow.  I'm going to plant it this Sunday, in the well prepared soil, that receives full sun.  I'll fertilize it again, and make sure it never wants for water.  Then, sit back and wait for my instant palm tree! I hear if you can push the tree to create 18 leaves (?) in one year, it'll bloom for you. That's what I want to see. So, don't worry about those outer leaves turning brown, and wilting. Its how these plants grow. As the outer leaves die, know this: larger, thicker, taller leaves are rolling out of the middle to replace it.
B000NJ3R26 Wanted a simple, inexpensive system for the raised garden in my alley.  Bought last year's model but didn't set it up because one of the hoses was badly kinked due to the way it was packaged by the manufacturer.  Decided to order another one this year, figuring I'd use 3 sections of hose and 4 sprinkler heads.  T'was not to be... Hose construction has been improved, but same packaging problem resulted in similar kink.  Went ahead and set up my original one (I'm returning new one) with just one hose and two heads. The sprayers worked reasonably well, and the spray is relatively close to the ground, which I liked.  Five nozzles are included - three are a full circular spray, one is cone shaped, and one is semi-circle - but don't think this is a high tech system.  The whole set-up is fairly primitive. The sprinkler heads are light weight plastic - so light that the slightest movement of the hose shifts them , making it hard to keep them flush with the ground. They really need to have some kind of weight set on them to keep them stationary and stable (or simply made heavier in the first place) .  I ended up not using them as my garden has a slope, which meant they had to be propped in order to be level.  I wasn't confident they wouldn't somehow get knocked off kilter, and as this was to constitute watering for an extended vacation it seemed too iffy,,,,
B000NJ3R26 First, my product seems to have a differnet hose than the one pictured above - and it is by far one of the most inferior/poor quality types of hose I've encountered to date. The actual sprinklers are all plastic so no worry about rust - but they are also very light weight and prone to move about easily. In a nutshell, this product works but for how long is another question entirely. For just a little more money I purchased three hose remnants and sprinkler heads here on Amazon - of MUCH better quality. I'm glad I only purchased one of these...given the cheap production we'll see how long it lasts but suffice to say, I won't be buying a 2nd one any time soon.
B000NJ3R26 Needed something to water a strip of lawn and these fit the bill perfect they are plastic but seem to be well made
B000NJ3R26 You're not going to leave this out over the winter. Perfect for spreading the sprinkling through a large vegetable garden. Easy to aim.
B000NJ3R26 Other reviews noted the low pressure, but where I use these, I don't need a lot of water pressure.  They work beautifully in a narrow area where you don't want to get water on the house.
B000NJTFPE This animal is the greatest thing since sliced bread. I originally replaced my perfectly good electric (with a cord) mower with the CMM1000 model 10 years ago and stopped dragging my cord around.It was like Christmas opening the box. Then I was disappointed in the fact that everything was put together. You did not need three hands to assemble obscurely named parts. They don't even care what angle you hold the mower at, as the battery does not spill. My lawn was so small that it is not even on the chart of square feet cut on a single charge. Following the instruction I plugged it in for 24 hrs prior to use. I was gearing up for an afternoon of mowing. I waved my arms around like Norton on the Honeymooners, disconnected the charger, inserted the safety key, pushed it to the lawn, and turned it on. It was so quiet that I had to make the motor sound my self. I used the mulcher mode so the rear bag is hanging on the wall. 15 minutes and it was all over. I am going to run out and find the best compost I can find so I can mow more often.-------------------------------------------------------A few changes have been made to the new model; the key is smaller. And some of the electronics were moved from the mower to the charger. I have not dismantled this one yet however the last one was very simple to dismantle as I replaced the batteries once after seven years.Black & Decker MB-850 19-Inch  Lawn Mower Replacement Blade
B000NJTFPE I just got this mower and this thing works great.  I charged it up overnight and then went about my lawn mowing.  I don't have that big of a lawn, would say about .08 of an acre so it had more than enough charge to cut the grass.  The mower is simple to use and requires no assembly except for the grass catcher bag.  Just remember to pull out the mulcher when you first use it if you want to catch the grass in the bag.The mower weighs about 80 pounds, and gets heavier as it fills with grass.  Flat lawns are effortless, but pushing it up an incline might prove troublesome for some.  It's not self propelled so it does take more effort, but once you start pushing and it's cutting the grass, it's not even noticeable.You just insert the safety key, and pull up the handle on the right side and off you go.  Instant on and off.  There is no option to plug in a cord so you will have to have it charged for each use if you want to cut your lawn.  Just make sure to charge it after each use and always leave it plugged in.  It's alot quieter than the gas mowers I have used and I think it is quiet enough that you can even cut the grass early morning without waking people up.Forget the trips to the gas station and no need to worry about gasoline catching on fire.  The charge is advertised to work up to 1/3 acre so if your lawn is smaller than that size, this is definitely the better choice.  Zero emissions and low noise.Again, Just remember to plug it in after every use and leave it plugged in year round and you should have a well maintained battery.
B000NJTFPE Smaller front and back yards, mow every 2 weeks on the average.  Have had for almost 3 and 1/2 years, still runs great.  Did recently have a problem with the power lever, a little plastic piece breaking off which made it unable to turn it on.  I opened it up and basically replaced the plastic with a nut & bolt and that part is now better than new.  This is extremely easy to adjust and to mow with.  It lasts quite a while on one charge, I would guess I could mow a baseball field infield grass (probably about size of my lawn) no problem.
B000NJTFPE So far, I'm thrilled with this purchase!After I charged it overnight, it mowed my 1/4 acre lot and big back yard without problem. No fumes, no oil, no gas, relatively little noise and it's SO much easier to plug something in than run to the gas station to fill a container!The push bar also collapses easily when you want it to, so it fits well into a nook in my already crowded two-car garage!I also like the idea that if I throw solar panels on my roof, I'll be able to fuel my mower with completely clean energy so I just may have to in the next couple of years!
B000NJTFPE Although this mower works well at cutting grass and bagging leaves, the switch is very poorly designed and has broken on both (I purchased two mowers since I have a larger yard) mowers within one year. A flimsy plastic handle pivots on a thin plastic post, held by a light-weight spring. The plastic post degrades and fatigues quickly, and eventually breaks off at both ends, resulting in a mower that will not operate.  I have not subjected the mower to unusually severe treatment, and cannot fathom why an otherwise well-designed appliance should have such a poorly designed switch.
B000NJTFPE The four stars is actually for our CMM1000 which was the first generation of this mower.  It's been a trooper for us and the only thing we do is sharpen the blades once a year and we've swapped out the batteries only once!&lt;COMPARO>I've put a quick guide of the most popular models on Amazon.

They are super quiet, clean, and convenient. They aren't necessarily cheaper than a gas mower since they cost more up front but there is almost NO maintenance. (We spent $80 over 10 years for a set of replacement batteries.) Corded electric mowers are a lot cheaper but then you have a cord.>>Why SHOULDN'T I get a cordless mower? They weigh a LOT more than gas mowers so if you have a hilly lot or have difficulty with physical exertion, forget it. They don't have as much power as gas and re-fueling means charging for a few hours so if your lot is over  acre you may want to reconsider.>>Why do they all come with mulching PLUS bagging? Electric powered mowers have come a long ways but mulching still takes a LOT more power than discharging, so bagging is pretty much a standard feature.>>What is a watt-hour? It's basically how big your gas tank is - the more watt-hours, the longer you can mow before you have to recharge.>>Is the cutting path a big deal? Yes - for two reasons. 1) The first thing manufacturers do when power is marginal is reduce the blade size, so I tend to see the smaller mowers as more likely to be underpowered. Second, when you consider that you have to overlap each pass by ~3\", a 20\" blade now effectively cuts 13% more on each pass. If you have a larger yard, you definitely do NOT want anything under 18\"  Also, my measurements show most mowers overstate their blade size by 1/2\" (Our 20\" measures 19-5/8, our 19 measures 18-1/2)>>Why might I want a removable battery? If you have a large yard, this means you can have a second battery charging while you are using the first. A second battery typically costs $100-$150 but it can make the difference between going electric or not. Finally, if you keep the mower in a shed that doesn't have power, a removable battery will let you bring it in for charging.>>How long will my batteries last?  That depends on your climate and usage.  We had a small lot for many years and were religious about recharging right after use.  We also live in a cooler climate (Michigan) so the mowing season is shorter.  Our batteries lasted about 7 years.  Most people should get 3-4 years easily but if you're careless and live in Arizona, you could probably kill the batteries in a year or two.>>Why should I care about higher voltage? Higher voltage = more power, PLUS you can recharge the mower faster. With the same chemistry and current, a 36V mower will charge 50% faster than a 24V mower.>>Metal deck or plastic? Metal rusts but with minimal care it's not an issue. Plastic ends up giving you a more stuff to trim since you can't cut as close to fences, etc.If you've found this review helpful or have questions/comments, please let me know!
B000NSGNOG This is sort of a difficult product to evaluate. It is supposed to help keep algae from growing in your pool, but other things we use in the pool also do that. So if no algae grows, is this chemical responsible for it, or is it just maintaining acceptable chlorine levels and this stuff is irrelevant?I originally bought it as a stab at getting rid of some black algae stains plaguing a few spots on the vinyl liner. It did not help those.However, we've had a VERY rainy, often very hot summer. Those are perfect conditions for algae growth, and I haven't been using any more chlorine or algaecide than normal. I have been using three capfuls of this once a week. I haven't seen the first tiny spot of algae try to get a toehold this summer. With experience over 19 years of pool ownership, under these weather conditions I would say that is very unusual, and very pleasant.Since adding this chemical is the only thing I'm doing different than years where I might have had to brush off a few algae spots, I'm going to give it credit. It certainly is no more expensive than using extra algeacide and shock, and those are responsive measures rather than preventative measures. Its better to have the algae not show up in the first place than to have to beat it back when it does.Recommended.
B000NSGNOG This is a great product if you are like me and prefer using natural pool products instead of swimming in chemicals. This is the second product you use to keep the phosphates down after using phos free. Phos free brings phosphates down, pool perfect plus phos free is the maintenance step to keep them in check. Algae feed on phosphates, so remove the food bye bye algae. Note when algae die they put off phosphates as well. Once you get phosphates under 500 you can use this.If you have an algae bloom like I did before finding this stuff this company also has a super concentrate called first aid. I used a product called banish as I did not know about first aid at the time. I slowly reduced the phosphates after the outbreak although you can dump a whole jug without any issues.You must still watch your chlorine levels and don't let them drop, but you can use less chlorine, or in my case turn the salt water generator down some.
B000NSGNOG My pool can't function without Phos Free ... just a little bit each week keeps the algae at bay!  My pool is very hot (94 degrees in the summer) and even hotter if I run the hot tub; so some sort of algae control is absolutely required.  When I'm using Phos Free, the pool is algae free and clear as a bell!
B000NSGNOG use this if yo uhave any algae issues.  once you get rid of your algae, this will keep it away. i promise you that.  i found this item while i had a profesional pool company cleaning my pool.  when i went to the pool supply store, to buy it, the guy asked if i had a pool cleaning company.  i said no, and he said it is the best kept secret out there. one product that keeps you rpool super clean and algae free!!FORGET ALL THE CRAP ON THE SHELVES....USE THIS!  using this for over five years now and it works great!
B000NSGNOG I developed algae in my pool that kept coming back, even after treating the algae with an algaecide.  Well, I finally learned that to rid your pool of algae you have to first rid it of phosphates because that it basically the food for your algae.  And if you don't remove the phosphates, the algae will keep coming back.So, I first started with Phos Free.  Not the one labeled Pool Perfect + Phos Free because that is just for maintenance.  Look for the one they call simply \"Phos Free\" (by the same company).  That is like a shock treatment to rapidly remove the phosphates from your water.  Just follow the directions on that product, and then once your phosphate levels are down to an acceptable level (zero is best, but I've been told up to 300ppm is acceptable) THEN you can start using the Pool Perfect + Phos Free product on a weekly basis to maintain it.I now add the Pool Perfect + Phos Free to my pool once a week, and have not seen any algae re-appear.  It's been a couple months since I started using it, and I am very happy with it.***P.S.  I originally bought this product from Leslie's Pool Supply, but I will never buy any product from them again after I found out that their website rating system is rigged.  They will NOT publish a review about a product if it is negative in the slightest bit.  They will only publish (or maybe even write themselves) a review for a product if it is positive, so you never know if you're reading accurate/fair reviews or not.  I have emailed their corportate headquarters about this numberous times regarding my concern over why only my positive reviews are showing up on their website, but they haven't fixed the problem and don't even have the courtesy to respond.  Do NOT buy from Leslie's.  Amazon is the only way to go because at least you can read ALL the reviews and judge for yourself.
B000NSGNOG Boy, does this work! We had a green pool from the winter winds and spring pollen. This worked within 2 days of back-flushing and one filter cleaning. My gardener couldn't believe that the pools was clean and clear within one week (actually 3 days). This is the best price for the product but the nice part is having it delivered.
B000NSGNOG I just started using Phos-Free/Pool-Perfect this year on my 12,500-gallon pool.  It works.  The water is as clear as it was when the pool was first filled 7 years ago.  I use 1-1/2 capfuls once a week and no sign of the algae that showed up early-on this year and the water is crystal-clear.  When this runs out, I'll buy another container.  Simplest product to use that does what it says it will.  Can't beat that.
B000NSGNOG Being a new pool owner I don't know if by using this stuff I am eliminating the need to use other chemicals or not.  I have an automatic cleaner, use (3) 3&#34; chlorine tablets weekly and occassionally use muriatic acid to bring pH levels to where they should be.  I add 2 capfuls of the Pool Perfect + Phosfree weekly for my 22,000 gallon pool.  That's it.  My pool is spotless, no issues with discoloration, cloudiness, or smells.  Someone also commented that our water doesn't have that chlorine smell to it.  I don't know if it's because of using this or what?  Our chlorine levels are in line with what they should be.
B000NVDGFM I bot this hoping it would protect my feeder but the squirrels got right around it.  At first they would fall off, but then they eventually figured it out.  Also, in a windy storm my feeder and the bottom hook on the underside of the baffel fell right off.  Hook is lost in the snow, had to buy a new one at hardware store.  Can not recommend this.  Am going to try to coat it wish vaseline or wd40, see if that works.  Otherwise it is on to another feeder.
B000NVDGFM I got this cover to go with my birdfeederPerky-Pet 312C Panorama Bird Feeder, Copperto keep the squirrels off of it and to protect the feeder from the rain.  So far I haven't seen any squirrels any where near it, but it didn't quite shelter my feeder like I hoped and the seeds got soaked during a recent light rain.  Still, it is attractive (well, as attractive as these things go) and it had kept the squirrels out of my feeder so far.
B000NVDGFM This keeps the rain out of my dish-style hummingbird feeder perfectly.  It's also a deep dome so the feeder tucks up inside it just perfectly.  The hummingbirds can access it while the rain cannot.
B000NVDGFM I love this.  The seed in the feeder no longer gets soaked during rain storms and the birds at the feeder stay dry, too.
B000NVDGFM We had just purchased a couple of replacement bird feeders and wanted to get something smaller than the large domes for protecting the feeders from some of the rain.  While nothing will protect a feeder from a driving rain, this cover does very well for steady down pours and for light rain on our tube style bird feeders.The unit is very well made and is simple to assemble.  Both of the hooks pictured on the dome are included and they screw into the metal plate in the dome after you screw on a locking nut to each hook.  Once you thread in the hook you use the nut you previously put on to tighten against the metal plate.  This locks the hook in place so that it will come out with use.Would highly recommend this to anyone who needs a rain shield.  Keep in mind that this is NOT a squirrel baffle, but so far it has worked sell as such due to its steep sides.
B000NVM2L6 Little birdies love this feeder. I wonder if they get confused by their reflection in the window.I like that this feeder is window-mounted because not only can I watch them from inside, but the feeder is up and away from squirrels or stray kitties.
B000NVM2L6 Easy to use.
B000NVM2L6 I thought this would be great for our birds to feed at our window.  But very few want to perch on it.  Plus, it doesn't drain well.  After one season, the plastic discolored, and the suction cups wouldn't stick to the window.
B000NVM2L6 This was a gift I appreciated greatly  after my old one was ravaged by a storm.Since I had already acquired regular birdie visits from my previous one, the birds came back to feed without hesitation. The most common visitors are sparrows and chickadees.The clean application of this feeder onto the glass is key to a secure hold. Also make sure you place it within easy reach for cleaning and refilling.I'm not the only one enjoying birds at the window, my cats who are never outdoors are also entertained.Great gift for any bird lover, I recommend this to anyone who enjoys a close, indoor view of birds.
B000NVM2L6 Edit: 2 to 5 starsThis is a decent design and stays up well (and holds 2 cups of seed). But, the birds in my area utterly ignore both of the ones I purchased even though they bathe in the water-feeder right next to it. I have them on different sides of the house where the finches gather, and no-go.  They eat the seed it is filled with elsewhere, just not from the feeder.Edit:After several months of ignoring this feeder, the mother finches have found it in earnest and have taught their babies.  The finches used it all through spring and summer last year and are coming back in droves now that winter is warming up in California. The feeders are so popular that 6-10 more finches regularly line up on the fence railing waiting their turn!Now that there are birds inside or on top of both feeders most of the day my house cats are THRILLED. They have something so fascinating to watch just inches from their cat tree. My kitties spend 4+ hours a day watching birds and it has greatly improved their mood for the rest of the day; they're more attentive and loving.If you want to use 2+ feeders, place a second feeder out of sight of the first and the birds will fight less. I have a corner window (windows that come to a corner) and they the birds seem to prefer one feeder on each side vs both on one big window.
B000NVM2L6 Suction cups just don't work.  We have caulked this little feeder to the window.  I wish whoever makes suction cups would work on something that works. Good product - just make sure you figure out how to keep it up.
B000NVM2L6 I put this on a second-story window and it took less than two days for the birds to find it. So far, mainly the titmice, chickadees and house finches are eating from it. But I am hopeful that eventually I'll get some cardinals to find it. Its very easy to install...just read the instructions in these reviews about how to do it. Worked like a charm. I plan on buying more and putting them in various windows around the house.Update: I have now purchased 4 of these. The birds love them. I have never seen a Cardinal come to any of the feeders (they are hanging on first and second floor windows). I have mostly the birds mentioned above and wren, as well as nuthatches and woodpeckers if I put peanut butter suet in it. I have gotten mostly hairy and downy woodpeckers, which are small enough to actually sit inside the box. But I got a red bellied woodpecker the other day. He was MUCH too large to fit in the box, so hung off the side and rocked forward to grab the suet and then leaned back to eat it. He rocked back and forth a few times, flew away...and came back many times. I have suet in cages all around the house. But for some reason he wanted to go through the trouble of eating at this little plastic bird feeder. DETERMINATION!
B000NVM2L6 We loved it till the squirrel noticed it and started jumping on it trying to get to the food.  The idea is great but you have to find a window that isn't near a tree with squirrels around.
B000NVM2L6 My 2 cats love this feeder as it brings the outside birds right up to their ledge on the inside of the window. I received the feeder yesterday and filled it with sunflower seed and hung it even though heavy rains and winds were forecast.  Not only did the feeder NOT blow down, the seed inside remained dry!  YAY - no more wasted, moldy seed!
B000NVM2L6 This is a neat concept although I have not had any birds use it here yet. It's winter so I'm guessing by the spring it will fill up. I wish it was slightly bigger so that larger birds like a dove, cardinal could use. It would need another suction cup though.
B000NVM2L6 I have had 1 bird in it since I put it up..Have changed the food but they still don't come.  Would not buy another one. I think maybe a bigger opening would help..but
B000NVM2L6 No, the Perky Pet Window Feeder won't last forever -- a year or so before the suckers weather -- but while it's stuck to your window you'll be able to get a close look at our feathered friends, which can be so much fun for kids and adults.We stuck ours on the window next to the breakfast table.  The children got to where they'd sit so they could watch the chickadees and sparrows drop by to have breakfast with them.  And my husband and I enjoyed sitting quietly drinking coffee and doing not much else but waking up and watching them dart to and fro.I liked these small feeders well enough that every year I now buy them for the children's teachers.  Though I must admit that in kindergarten they didn't stay up long because they were too much fun and the little ones were paying more attention to who was dropping by to eat than their teachers (lol!)THE SKINNY:::Sticks well enough.  Can be difficult to fill if you don't think about this aspect before deciding on a site.  Didn't need cleaning unless there was a real downpour.  (You don't want the seed to get moldy and gross.)We highly recommend.Pam T and family~
B000NVM2L6 This window bird feeder works, but only stood up to 1 season of use for me before requiring repairs.  It's flimsy plastic, so you get what you pay for.Pros:- Plastic is clear, so watching birds is easy- The roof does help keep the bird seed dry- The suction cups had plenty of holding power and held to the glass through most of the winter- The plastic cleaned up well with dish soap and water- The limited opening was an effective deterrent to squirrel raids.Cons:- The feeder consists of two halves of plastic that are held together by 5 little nibs along the seam.  Through normal use, these nibs broke and my feeder started to separate.  Luckily, super glue works well.- The opening is only big enough for a single bird, in my experience, without squabbles.- A single fall, if the suction cups give out, will likely result in a broken feederI think it's just o.k. because it is easily damaged and didn't permit more than one bird to feed at a time.  I ultimately upgrade to aSongbird Essentials Recycled Plastic Window Bird Feeder.  It's more accessible by squirrels, but allows several birds to feed at once without squabbles and is built far more ruggedly than a plastic window feeder.Tip:  To increase suction cup strength, clean the window well and put a minute amount of cooking oil on the suction cup.  It increases holding power significantly.
B000NVM2L6 Not only do we humans enjoy the close up bird views, but my cats think this is the best invention ever.  They spend hours watching and making little cat chirps of joy. Best gift under $10 one can buy!
B000NVM2L6 This bird feeder is a total piece of crap.  It's made of cheap thin plastic with teensy connectors to bring both halves together.  Two of the flimsy connection prongs immediately broke upon insertion.  I doubt the product cost 25 cents to make.  Avoid this poorly made feeder.
B000NZZG3S This thermostat is a pretty nice construction.  The thermometer lead has a nice length to it.  The thermometer is pretty accurate and has nice response times.
B000NZZG3S I use this with the Hydrofarm CK64050 Germination Station with Heat Mat and it works great with it. The temperature could be faster at updating though. Sometimes I have to wait 10-15 minutes for a stable temperature after using fresh soil.
B000NZZG3S I picked this up for my son who just moved to St. Louis... pause for involuntary shake due to cold weather... and it connects perfectly to a flexible heat wrap to allows him to keep a constant temperature on his home brew year rounds.  Good thing he works for the largest brewer in St. Louis!
B000NZZG3S No more turning on and off the heat mat.  This little baby monitors the heat and keeps it at the temperature that you set it for.  I used to use the heating pad method under my seedling trays, but now they make most of them that turn off after a certain amount of time and that leaves the seedlings cold and without heat.  I bought two of the Hydrofarm seedling heat mats, plugged this digital thermostat in and never turned back.  I used it this Spring in the little conservatory where I keep the citrus trees in the winter.  It performed flawlessly.  If you want to keep a consistent heat under your little seedlings; this is the way to do it.
B000NZZG3S A must too help regulate temps for sprouting seeds and rooting clones .This will help speed up the time for root development, better the chance for successful germination & better success in rooting clones as well.Well worth my investment .
B000NZZG3S This keeps my heat mat at a steady temperature for seed germination. I used it for all my seeds this winter and it worked like a charm. I would recommend this product to anyone that grows plants from seed.
B000NZZG3S This made the Hydrofarm CK64050 Germination Station with Heat Mat more usable.  I hated that I could not tell at what temperature my seedlings were.  With just the heat mat I knew it would not be cold but did not know how hot.  This thermostat is awesome.  I feel like I have all the information I need to grow seeds and cuttings in a perfect environment, with a humidity dome.  I got this thermostat right after I got the germination station with heat mat. Then I also bought the higher dome cover.  7&#34; so my cuttings would fit.
B000NZZG3S Bought this along with the heat mat and glad I did. My greenhouse gets pretty warm during the day so this helps keep the mat from overheating my seed trays. It's really nice, easy to use and constantly displays the temp of your medium. It has a sensor that you push into the medium so it's measuring the temp of the soil at all times. Well worth it!
B000NZZG3S Used this thermostat for about five months, in a greenhouse, in conjunction with a heat mat.  It maintained the set temperature pretty well.  The only fault I can find is that the readout can be difficult to see in a bright environment such as a greenhouse.
B000NZZG3S This thing is such an absolute delight. Your heat mat plugs into this thermostat and then the thermostat plugs into the wall socket. Programming it is a breeze and the included sensor just goes into the plant bed. The only slight downside is sometimes the ideal heat may not be reached all the time. To solve this, simply unplug the thermostat from the wall and then plug it in again.
B000NZZG3S I have half a dozen of these thermostats to control 48&#34;x20&#34; heat mats.  The temperature maintained seems very accurate.  Heavy AC cable is overkill for controlling a 120W mat.
B000NZZG3S I just purchased my second one of these and so far they both have been working perfectly. There is nothing on the market in this price range that gives you a readout of the current temps with a nice bright red LED.Everything else is over $150.00........!Mine are actually used for ceramic heater.The Max current: 8.3 amps / 1000 watts
B000NZZG3S With this thermostat you can have complete temperature control and always will know what the temperature is.  The heat mat will work good without a thermostat  but works Great with one.
B000NZZG3S If you bought the Seedling Heat Mat your going to need this thermostat to complete your set up, with this it's a synch to have your heat mat keep its correct temperature, very easy to set then you just sit back and let it do its job.
B000NZZG3S The digital thermostat works with the Company's heat matHydrofarm CK64050 Germination Station with Heat Mat- there's nothing it can do on its own.It's ruggedly made, easy to use, program, understand and read. You might wonder how it works with the heat mat - you just plug the 3-prong plug from the mat, into the receptacle on the thermostat - which, in turn, plugs into the wall.I've had mine working for 2 weeks, and I can read it at a glance. I've confirmed that the temperature is what it says it is with a separate thermometer - bang on.I'm starting herbs (cilantro, parsley, basil and more) right now, and all the little green guys are up, and apparently loving the consistent temperature and humidity in the germination station.Recommended!
B000NZZG3S I have 4 of these currently and use them for all kinds of different things.It is very easy to use right out of the box and the temperature gauge is surprisingly accurate and they all have always been right on point with my external thermometers.Highly recommended!
B000OM82J0 Seems this product is best for getting your seeds to take off and root fast, looking forward to seeing how it helps with the garden outdoors. Does well with house plants
B000OM82J0 Using Superthrive to boost my plants health this summer and it will boost my crops production.  You don't need much for it to be effective.
B000OM82J0 This is some amazing stuff! It works fast and a great supplements for the garden. I'm never unhappy when I buy this product.
B000OM82J0 I've head from various reviews that it's just not the same as the 'old' formulation. Far as I can tell, it works as it always has. i've used this stuff for forty years, and it's good stuff.
B000OM82J0 This liquid is like having plants on steroids!We kept all of our summer geraniums &#34;juiced&#34;all winter and the result was obvious(not leggy,but full of greenery.It is really concentrated,plants love it and it is a great&#34;recovery solution &#34;for plants in distress.
B000OM82J0 I have been using this stuff since.....well, 40 years, and I still think it is the best thing out there to make plants stay happy!
B000OM82J0 I have been using this for over a year in order to really give it a chance.  I've used it on various potted plants as well as plants in the garden.  I really wanted this stuff to work but I wanted to be objective.  I only used it on half of my plants of each variety to see if there would be a difference.  Soil, fertilisers, care, light etc were all the same but only half got the \"Superthrive\".  ABSOLUTELY NO DIFFERENCE.  It didn't seem to harm the plants but also made ZERO difference to growth, flowering, size or taste.  Obviously some people love this stuff but I can't see why...placebo effect?  If it was as spectacular as it claims, then why wouldn't it be a standard product for all commercial growers?  Bottom line for them is money and obviously they see this as a waste...as do I.
B000ORYO4W I have been using a Hoover Spin Sweep for years (on my second one) so when this came up, I thought it would be a good product to review. My review is going to mainly be as a comparison with the Hoover model.Karcher better than Hoover1) Cleaner pick up. The Karcher uses a single round broom in the back to scoop up debris and deposit it in the bin. It does a much better job of cleaning up what you roll over. The Hoover relies on the front 2 brushes to sweep debris into the bin and tends to leave a small line of debris from where the 2 brushes come together2) Better front spinning brushes. The secret of the Karcher front brushes is they a geared to spin slower than the Hoover's. This results in a gentler sweeping action that does not fling debris to the left and right like the Hoover does, especially the faster you walk. The bristles are softer and do a good job a simply moving debris under the sweeper to be swept up by the back brush3) Dust bin easier to empty. It just sits in place and you do not need to push a button to get it out or press down to click it back in place. The problem with the Hoover over the years is the bin lock can break because you are pushing down in the same spot to lock it back in placeHoover better than Karcher:1) Easier to push. The Karcher seems to have a lot of gears to turn and it is noticeably harder to push than the Hoover, which seems feels featherweight in comparison2) Better with large debris. The Karcher has a &#34;twig catcher&#34; in the form of plastic fins that are supposed to keep large objects out of the bin, but it tends to get clogged up. Since I have a lot of little twigs to sweep up, this has been something I have to avoid with the Karcher. The Hoover seems to be able to swallow everything.3) Brush bumpers. The Hoover has bumpers with wheels on the outer part of the machine that do an excellent job of guiding the sweeper around walls and corners so the brushes keep spinning. The Karcher's brushes are unprotected and you can easily jam them to a stop against walls4) Steering. The Hoover steers easily and goes in a straight line. The Karcher seems to have a mind of its own and you are constantly adjusting it to stay in a straight line5) Reach. The Hoover uses the front brushes in a single step to sweep debris up at the front of the sweeper, so you can usually get anything the brushes touch into the box, but the Karcher uses a 2 step approach and you have to travel the length of the sweeper before the debris get lifted into the bin. Imagine trying to clean up under a table. The Hoover would get everything as far as you can push, but the Karcher would need more room to travel to get the same debris.6) Containment. This is something perhaps particular to my situation. I have to move the sweeper up a step to cover the area I sweep. Picking the Hoover up with the handles angles the front up as I move it. It also angles the Karcher the same way. But when you tilt the Karcher backwards, some of the debris in the bin falls back out, onto the rear brush and gets stuck in there and ends up being redistributed all over the ground as you move it, You have do extra sweeping to get it all up. The Hoover bin stays contained and even helps, because as the bin gets almost full, it can start coming out the front. The Hoover has a bigger bin, tooAt first I thought the Karcher was much worse than the Hoover, but as I used it more, I've come to realize it may be better for some jobs than others. It does a better job on driveway debris, for example. I really wanted to give it 3.5 stars.In the end, I would say use the Karcher if you have a lot of flat area with a lack of big twigs to pick up and you want a clean sweep (a garage floor would be good). But if you want an easier to push and guide sweeper that can pick up bigger and more debris, but not do it as cleanly, the Hoover might be better. I'm luck to have both, so I can switch between the two depending on the job.
B000ORYO4W Karcher's a great company. I like their products. This one is targeted to people who want to sweep concrete, as on sidewalks, driveways, and garages. The compartment that holds the debris isn't very big, so it won't hold a huge amount of leaves, etc. However, it is easy to maneuver and seems to be built well. If you are SERIOUSLY SERIOUS about keeping the concrete around your house fastidiously clean, this may be the right machine for you.
B000ORYO4W This sweeper was very easy to assemble. (The assembly instructions had no words, just diagrams.)The sweeping area is large. It's about 26 inches across (from the outside edges of the round brushes). The sweeper is very easy to maneuver and make turns. it has a cylindrical brush at the back of the unit and 2 round brushes at the front. It is not perfect at picking up debris, but I prefer this over the loud blower that we usually use to clean up the driveway.I like that the handles fold down to make it more compact for storage.
B000ORYO4W I got this push sweeper to do my walkways and driveway, because I hate carrying the leaf blower around, it gets very heavy after a while. So I started with my driveway, because now that the warmer weather is here, I wanted to sweep up all the dirt and salt from the snow, and this sweeper did a great job with that, but the compartment is kind of small, so it doesn't hold a whole lot, and I found myself emptying it constantly. However, it is very easy to put together, and very easy to push along the driveway and walkway. The good thing about this is that I can push it, and not have to carry anything. It does a great job with picking up debris, it's just the emptying it constantly that is bothersome. I feel like this should be geared towards the older generation that wants to clean their own walkways and driveways, but don't want to carry around a leaf blower. Or even towards people that have back problems, because you can lean on it while your pushing it. I just wish it had a bigger compartment so I don't have to keep emptying it.
B000ORYO4W It was quick and easy to assemble.  It is a cinch to push. It picks up all the debris. I use it on my sidewalks, patios, and my messy garage floor.
B000ORYO4W This sweeper is better than a broom in some ways, and not better in other ways.When it's better than a broom...After running my lawn edger, my sidewalks are full of grass clippings that I would rather not blow back onto the lawn to turn brown and ugly. Running this sweeper on my long sidewalks is much better than using a broom. It does a good job of collecting the clippings and saves my hands from blisters.When it's not better than a broom...Tight areas such as the garage.When the grass or leaves are wet.If there are clumps of soil.Mostly, I'd say it's better. I'm glad I have it simply for the clean-up after edging. It's worth it for me just for that.
B000OV8OTY Sticky Stakes successfully wooed and killed tiny gnats growing in my potted plants.  Although the view of used Sticky Stakes is not pleasant, the work is done.  I highly recommend this product.
B000OV8OTY Works amazing.  Attracts fruit flies and fungus gnats.  However, know that this is really only a &#34;band-aid&#34; to your problem and may not solve your problem with one or two applications.  If you have fruit flies, the root of the problem will probably be left over food somewhere, check dishwasher, under the counter, take the garbage out more frequently.  If you have fungus gnats, it will most likely be moist environments and decaying plant matter, i.e. stop watering your plants so frequently.
B000OV8OTY I had a big problem with nats and this did the trick for me it took about a month but it worked like a charm.
B000OV8OTY We were having trouble with white flies and other insects that were killing our tomatoes and other potted plants, This little trap catches them easily and since we do not like insecticides, it is part of 
B000OV8OTY These work well for helping control the mass populations of fungus gnats that seem to breed in the potting soil of my houseplants. The only problem with them is there is no good way to peel the backing off and stick the paper into the holders without getting the sticky residue on your fingers. I've tried several different techniques but I always end up getting my fingers all tacky and it is hard to get off even with soap and water.
B000OV8OTY These work great.  You stick them on little spikes, (if you can get them off of your fingers) and the little insects stick to them.
B000OWF7YI WOW!  Whenever I have trouble growing a plant, I have to look absolutely *no* further than Miracle Gro.  By the next day (assuming it's a sunny warm day) the wilted leaves and stems are guaranteed to look MUCH healthier and beautiful by simply adding only a touch of Miracle Gro.  No matter WHAT kind of plant it is, this stuff seriously works amazingly well.  I can't recommend it highly enough!  Just last week my tomato and pepper plants were looking ill for example, and Miracle Gro completely gave those plants the refreshment and reinvigoration they so desperately needed, haha.  What a great way to help any plant that's looking wilted and weak.  Get ready for the surprise of your life!
B000OWF7YI this is another great buy , I use this in my garden all summer an my garden is the biggest an best out of my whole neighborhood please buy this if you have a garden or planting one it works
B000OWF7YI I have a container vegetable garden each summer for years since I don't have space for a garden in ground.  I have relied on Miracle-Gro for years to feed and fertilize my container grown vegetables.  Easy and convenient to use... just dissolve in water and feed to your plants every 7-14 days.  You would be amazed how many vegetables- peppers, cucumbers, eggplant, tomatoes and the like you can grow in a few pots on your deck or patio.  Also great for your houseplants.
B000OWF7YI You can't go wrong with miracle-geo for annuals and perennials. Feed the as directed and you will have healthy plants. Am I selling the product, no! However I am a horticulturist and know plants well. At the same time I would not use this on my vegetables because it is a chemical. Again, good for annuals and perennials.
B000OWF7YI Which I found somewhat confusing, especially when I wanted to use it in a non-Miracle-Gro hose-end sprayer. Eventually I gave up on the sprayer and went back to measuring two tablespoons per two gallons of water. It's hard to beat Miracle-Gro.
B000OWF7YI I have read and been following all the reviews of this product so far. So far this product is working wonders on my garden, it is one of the ingredients I am using this year for a strong healthy garden. I am using this product for all my vegetables and flowers. I have 14 different varieties of corn, I have 12 different varieties of carrots, I have 94 tomato plants of different varieties, I have broccoli and I have cabbage, peppers sweat and hot, I have cabbage and herbs, peas and beans, watermelon strawberries and canalope, I have onions and a lot of other things and so far everything is growing big and strong. I am using one package a week it comes with eight packages and I mix it with water and keep it in a water sprayer. Do not dump right on plants and do not let the blue sit on the plants in powder form. us as directed will do just fine. I also used cow manuer in the ground before I planted and I make sure to water every day unless it is raining outside. But I do like this product and I do keep pictures and videos from day to day as to compare the different years to see what works and so far this product is working and doing a great job. I have very healthy plants that are bigger then even I expected.
B000OWF7YI This works great to feed all my potted plants and hanging baskets. Just a tablespoon or two in each can of water and I can be sure my plants will be well fed. Buying the large size is way more economical too.
B000OWF7YI This has got to be the biggest box of Miracle Grow plant food ever.  When you get it, you'll be so happy!  It will last forever.  I use it on my potted fruit trees, in my sprayer, too.  Don't buy it anymore at the grocery store or home warehouse.  I can't believe the price!
B000OWF7YI I really wasn't expecting the growth for my Lilac bush. It exploded. A few days later, I looked and the thing was all over the place. Pruning time for sure.Picea abies 'Hillside Upright' got lots of bright, new growth as well. Hemlocks are happy. Just fed baby boxwoods yesterday and they already seemed to grow noticeably.
B000OWF7YI Miracle-Gro has always been good and I got this because of the price and convenience. All one has to do is put one of the packets the box contains  into the Miracle-Gro Sprayer (Miracle-Gro 100410 Garden Feeder) and one can feed the lilacs and everything else in sight in a relatively short time.
B000OWF7YI I bought this for my house plants and it's more than I'll ever need.  The tub is huge, and all I need is a little tiny scoop (it comes with the scoop) in a bucket of water.  This can also be used with the Miracle-Gro garden feeder, which is actually a more appropriate use for this given the bulk size of the container.I have a tendency to neglect my plants, just water them now and then so they don't die.  Every so often, I decide I'd better take better care of them and start feeding them Miracle-Gro.  They start greening up the very next day.  What a difference.  I love how they look when I feed them Miracle-Gro.
B000OWF7YI I just bought the same 10 pound box for 17.88 at the local Home Depot.I've been using the granular Miracle Grow for 30 years or so.  It works well.  You can expect most plants to show improvement after about 10 days.COMPARISON TO MIRACLE GROW LIQUID FERTILIZER.As others have noted regarding the soluble fertilizer feeder (used with the granular fertilizer), the feeder it is erratic.  If you don't empty the container and allow it to dry after every use, it can clog up internally and will cease to deliver fertilizer.  The Liquid Miracle Grow system has exactly the same problems (in my experience, worse), and is the fertilizer is more expensive.OTHER CONCERNS> Sometimes you get a bright blue stream, and a few seconds later, a colorless stream (presumably containing less fertilizer).> A different situation is when a few minutes of watering, the solution is considerably less blue.  What happens is that the blue pigment is more soluble than other components of the fertilizer, but the blue pigment itself is probably not an essential component of the fertilizer.  As long as there is at least a teaspoon of undissolved fertilizer in the container, the feeder is still probably delivering full-strength fertilizer solution.TIPS ON USE:Fill about half (not more than half) the container with water.  Pour in the dry fertilizer---much of it will dissolve instantly as it hits the water, making room for the rest of the bag.  Add water as necessary to fill the container.  Screw the sprayer onto the container.  Shake (and turn upside down) to mix.  The first several minutes will be very rich, so use it where you need the most fertilizer.  Swirl the container occassionally as you water to encourage the undesolved fertilizer to dissolve.  Concentrate on spraying the leaves, not the soil---the soil will get enough dripping from the leaves.When there gets to be only a teaspoon of undesolved fertilizer in the container, consider it \"used up\".  You can continue to water, but don't assume that you are applying fertilizer.  When you are nearly done, turn the container upside down.  That will empty the container, including any undesolved fertilizer, so the fertilizer stream can be rich, so spray it where it is needed.  Water with the container upside down for 30 seconds or so after the container is empty to rinse out the internal passageways.  Ideally, you should take the sprayer off the hose, and open it so that the sprayer and container and dry out fully.FEEDING SCHEDULEA good soaking will provide your plants with all the nutrients they need for a 2-week growth spirt.  Beware though that the solubility of Miracle Grow is a mixed-blesssing, if you feed your garden in the morning, an afternoon shower can wash all the Miracle Grow away before your plants have a chance to absorb most of the nutrients.  So, I suggest using Miracle Grow at least once-a-week in the spring when your plants are growing rapidly.  Later in the summer, when growth slows and rain is frequent, reduce the feeding schedule to one every two to four weeks.  Toward the Fall, a maintenance feeding once a month may be advisable.  Most professional gardeners discourage Fall feeding, on the theory that dormancy should be encouraged to avoid frost damage.  Depending on your situation, your feeding schedule might be different.  Here in tropical South Florida, the dry season sets-in in the Fall and the plants come out of their Summer torpor, so that's when I step-up my feeding schedule.  If your Springs are cool and misty---once every two weeks may be adequate. In the northeastern States, I suspect that weekly feeding all Summer long would be desirable.FOLIAR FEEDINGPart of the whole point of Miracle Grow is foliar feeding---that plants will absorb nutrients through their leaves faster than via their roots---but the leaves can only absorb a little at a time.  So foliar feeding needs to be light and frequent.  Light frequent foliar feeding (even daily) is most effective in which it rains frequently during the growing season, washing nutrients out of the upper soil layer.  Orchids are best feed sprayed daily with a weak foliar solution.DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS FOR DIFFERENT PROBLEMSDespite all the shortcomings of Miracle-grow feeders, they remain the best solution for fertilizing home vegetable or flower gardens.  Trees, hedges, and lawns are best feed inexpensive dry granular 10-10-10 fertilizer, well watered in.  Orchids and delicate indoor flowers are best sprayed (with a pump-up or squeeze bottle sprayer) with a weak solution (1 teaspoon/gallon) of liquid Miracle Grow.  New plants are best started with slow-release fertilizer pellets mixed in with the soil.
B000OWF97S have a couple different seeds planted already. One has already popped up. Not sure if that's due to the dirt, but i'm happy.
B000OWF97S This seed starting potting soil is great for seeds and for rooting cuttings.  It is light and airy and roots can develop nicely.  Plant seedlings need air to grow properly.  It is clean, sterile and without fungus.  Fungus can cause damping off disease which usually kills the plant.  I would recommend this mix.
B000OWF97S If you like using Jiffy-Mix seed starting mix, comparison shop.  Even your local home center probably has it available cheaper.
B000OWF97S The price is great but found this easy to use and my plants doing great. So glad I got it.
B000OWF97S I keep herbs in my kitchen year round and this soil works very well for me. I start seeds in the little Jiffy wafers and set them in a larger container of the starting mix. I use grow lights because I don't have good light in my kitchen. This winter I am adding some wonderful pepper plants I am starting now.I'll trasfer them to 4 inch pots, keep them under the lights until Spring and set out the plants, along with tomatoes I'll start later. It is very nice and easy to work with this soil. It is light and holds moisture very well. I have good luck with it.
B000P0DK1Q BROKE
B000P0DK1Q + Does the job, mixes feed decently with water if you don't tilt/shake it around too much.- Very on/off trigger, wish it was more progressive or had a light setting for smaller plants.  Seems like it's made for large coverage and or large plant watering.-Leaks slightly in a couple areas, around the head and somewhere around the trigger, but not terrible.Overall, glad I got it, does the job.
B000P0DK1Q I bought this not for the fertilizer that comes with it I use that regularly anyway and have been using the fertilizer this review is not about the fertilizer I love there fertilizer and usually I love all there products however the Garden feeder I am not impressed with and there are cheaper and better feeders on the market. I will list by number the things I found wrong with this particular feeder.1.  Pressure is not very good on any of the settings.2.  Dispenses product unevenly3.  Dispenses product to fast or to slow or not at all4.  Have to turn upside down at times to get product to come out even after it is mixed really well5.  The setting spin on the front the dial does more harm then good at letting the water out in a certain way6.  No hose or tube inside the bottle or bowl area to pull product through everything is based on how much water is in bowl.Ok to be fair these are the positives1.  Light weight2.  Arrived on time3.  Does come with Miracle product inside of it ready to go.4.  The water shut off Does work ok5.  The product shut off to allow only water to get through works OK also.As I said I love and I use Miracle grow however I am not at all impressed with this dispenser and or there liquid dispenser. For a company that puts so much hard work into a great product to help plants grow you would think they would put more effort and ideas into how to dispense the product onto the plants and not sell cheap stuff at a higher price.Two stars because it showed up early and I like that that is one star, it was packaged well and arrived brand new, that is two stars. Did come with product inside that I love and it does not leak and it did put the product onto my garden even if I did not like the way it did it so that is the third star.I finally had to downgrade this to a two star, wow I really do not like this product. It leaks now and it is not that old, does not dispense evenly, I tried my best at giving it time and seeing if I would like it but I do not.Hope this helps anyone looking.
B000P0DK1Q I just used it again this afternoon. It is simple, durable, and does the job remarkably well when used with the ready-made packets in Scotts Company Miracle Gro All Purpose Plant Food and Miracle-Gro 1001832 Lawn Food Box, 5-Pound container. I just noticed Miracle-Gro is part of the Scotts company which explains much. Also, the price is right--I'd actually pay a little more for the sprayer and food.
B000P0DK1Q This review applies to ALL Miracle-Gro brand fertilizer-feeders, includingMiracle-Gro 100410 Lawn and Garden FeederMiracle-Gro 101411 LiquaFeed Starter KitMiracle-Gro 101411 LiquaFeed All Purpose Plant Feeding SystemandMiracle-Gro 100511 LiquaFeed Advance Starter KitI totally agree with ALL of you who have posted on the \"rip-off\" index of these products. My \"other half\" bought these one of each type at local home improvement warehouse on two different occasions thinking how easy it would be to use. She did not realize how EXPENSIVE it would be for the LiquaFeed Kits, it just looked EASY. Not only are the refill cartridges costly, the things LEAK, don't dispense evenly and is basically garbage! (Maybe she has learned on 2nd time around, then again ... )Miracle-Gro bulk granular water soluble fertilizers of various types are great! I have never burned any plants with them (see note below) and have healthy excellent looking flowers, plants and few veggies. But Miracle-Gro equipment is JUNK, including this item and Miracle Gro Lawn & Garden Feeder Miracle-Gro 100410 Lawn and Garden Feeder.  They are made of BRITTLE plastic, as I stated LEAK, do not mix & dispense fertilizer well, and break easily.AVOID these products.( NOTE: I do apply in cool of morning or after sunset here in HOT central Texas, and after going around fertilizing ALL plants, come back and \"mist off\" any fertilizer that may still be too concentrated on leaves and water plants. )
B000P0DK1Q This carries the Miracle-Gro name, so I expected it to be good stuff, in spite of the low price.  It does work well, but my water pressure blew out the first one I bought (locally), so I had to get a pressure-reducing coupler--not a big deal--and now this sprayer works fine.
B000P0FHQ2 STARTED GROWING CLOVER?
B000P0FHQ2 This lawn food has worked great bringing my lawn back to life. after getting the weeds under control with a different product, this fertilizer has brought back the lush green color my lawn should have! As others have noted though, it takes many applications before you see the results and often you can find this stuff much cheaper in your local brick and mortar stores. I have found it for about 9 bucks at my local walmart.
B000P0FHQ2 If you get this and the sprayer (Miracle-Gro 100410 Garden Feeder, Ready-to-Use Solution, 1-Pound) you can do your whole lawn in just a few minutes with excellent results. This container has 4 packets. You open the durable, extremely simple and easy-to-use sprayer, put in one packet, and spray. No ratios, no guesswork, no nothing but pleasant results. I believe I love the darn things.... The lawn does, anyway.
B000P0FHQ2 My front yard has only a couple inches of top soil covering crappy clay. It literally died last year in a horrible heat wave and drought, and did not come back this Spring. I dethatched and replanted it. After the new grass germinated and was a few weeks old, I applied this lawn food generously with a sprayer.One month later, I have a thick, beautiful, dark green lawn. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to conclude that the grass LOVED this product. I'll have to wait and see how long it stays happy, but I wouldn't hesitate to buy this again.
B000P0FHQ2 This product seems to be very effective in &#34;greening up&#34; the lawn, and it is certainly easy to apply.  HOWEVER, I must comment on the Miracle-Gro  sprayer I purchased to apply the lawn food (there are very few sprayers which will accept a granular product and dilute it in the sprayer).  I went through two of them before--both started leaking profusely out the business-end of the sprayer the first time I used them.  It finally dawned on me that my water pressure was too high for the sprayer (100 psi), and, upon disassembling one of the units, I discovered that a small O-ring in the valve had been displaced by the pressure.  I purchased a pressure-reducing adapter (from Amazon) which lowered the pressure and solved the problem.  I had to buy a third sprayer and it worked just fine.  I also re-glued the one I had disassembled, and now IT works well, also.
B000P1TB9K I think this Aspects 182 Super Dome Humbrella for Bird feeders by Aspects is about double the price I would have liked to pay, but this Humbrella Dome for Bird Feeder is just what I need to keep the squirrels out of my feeder. The price of feed saved will pay for it over one season and I won't have to cringe when I look out and see one of the little fuzzy tails hanging upside down from my feeder. Works well and is a sound product which offers: Classic styling for easy cleaning and refilling: Strong polycarbonate construction is leak proof and drip resistant and has a Bee Resistant design and built-in ant moat.
B000P1TB9K I bought this to add to my squirrel proof feeder (other review). Wish I had bought it from day 1 because the squirrels had already chewed parts of that feeder, and this prevents squirrels from sliding onto ANY feeder....they slip right off.....clear plastic has not discolored and does its job. Birds linger on the feeder when it's raining since they keep dry....
B000P1TB9K Squirrels learned in a few days how to get around this.  I wasted my money but you don't have to.
B000P1TB9K A good squirrel baffle actually serves two purposes being directly over a feeder.  It hopefully keeps the pesky varmints that its designed to deter away, and it also serves as a roof in keeping rain and whatnot away from the seed portals and helps them stay dry.  There are people that buy baffles as protection from the weather even if they are fortunate enough not to be bothered by squirrels.  The Aspects dome is certainly big enough to do both jobs.  But it is no more effective than any other baffle of the same size and design that is much cheaper.  If one sets out to buy a baffle just about anywhere of the dome variety, they will get a swift and severe education as to how expensive they are.  You will come to believe that all baffles must have uranium in them somewhere to be so overpriced.  The only exception to that rule that I have come across is the dome that can be found at a local Tractor Supply company, or at the Tractor Supply website.  They sell a full 15\" gray plastic dome squirrel baffle for the unbelievable price of only $8.00.  (At the time of this writing.  It my be a little more now, but will forever be far cheaper than the Aspects).  They are the same size as the Aspects and have the same double hook system.  And they also come with an attachment for mounting the baffle on a pole if that serves your needs. They are so cheap and effective I ordered 6 of them at once for all my feeders.  The only difference between the two is the Tractor Supply baffle is a solid gray instead of clear.  Something I actually prefer since the clear ones only look clear for the first couple of Weeks anyway.  From that time on they are never clear again.  If you're in the market for a baffle, especially for more than one, forget this horrendously overpriced Aspects model and check out the squirrel baffles at Tractor Supply company.  You will be most pleased I believe... : )
B000P1TB9K Very well made, not \"cheap, thin, brittle plastic\".  Quite attractive, actually....but most importantly, keeps those annoying tree rats (squirrels) out of my bird feeders.
B000P1TB9K This is one of my favorite domes because it is 18 inches in diameter. (Wide domes offer more protection.) The polycarbonate is thick and the hangers are heavy duty. It's durable. My only complaint is that the top screw hook is too long. Feeders need to be high enough off the ground so that feeding birds are safe from cats.This particular dome works best on feeders that have a ring or very short hook on top. A ring or  short hook allows the dome to almost rest on top of the feeder, and that's the way it protects the birds and seeds. In the photo displayed in this listing, the feeder has a tall bail for hanging. The dome hooks on the bail. But see how this makes the dome sit WAY above the feeder? That's not good because it exposes both the birds and seed ports to rain and snow. This style feeder needs the Aspects 351 Super Tube Top II or any dome that has a slit across the top that is wide enough to go over a bail in a way that the dome rests directly on top o the feeder. Look at the Aspects 351 Super Tube Top II and you'll see what I mean. Whatever you buy, make sure that the opening at the top of the dome will fit the hook, eye or bail on your feeder.
B000P1TB9K We have lots of squirrels and I have fought many the battle to save my feeders.  Purchased this as my last attempt before just giving in and giving up on feeders.  This is a miracle!  They all have tried to get to several different styles of feeders under this dome and NONE have made it.  They have given up and now my feeder is safe and full for the birds.  Birds were a bit confused at first since it is quite large, but only took a few days and now they're loving it as well.
B000P1TB9K I live in Florida, a state that experiences almost daily monsoon like weather every day during the summer, with horizontal rain being common at least a few times a week. I purchased my first as a rain guard to keep my feeder dry.The reason it looks silly is because I have various Brome Bird Feeders which are quite long (12 to 18&#34;) and while the dome is super wide, it doesn't look like it will do anything. Then the rain will begin, my Florida wide gutters straining to handle the rain, but the dome &#34;appears&#34; to be blocking the rain. Immediately after the rain stop, I stick my fingers into each port to test the dampness of the seeds. To my surprise, they were fully dry. I tested this on one of our rainiest summers. Note - I do take my bird feeders down during severe hurricanes, but it did handle a record breaking 22&#34; of water in a 24 hour time period.When I purchased future bird feeder, I ordered an additional super dome. Combing the cost of this pricey dome plus a good feeder (Brome in my case), it can really hurt one's pocket book,  but it is hard to argue with success - on an almost daily basis I see feeding: 3 red bellied woodpeckers, 4 cardinals, 40 golden finches, 2 bluejays, and the random mocking bird or robin.
B000P1TB9K Compare this to the Tube Top Dome, 12&#34; Clear version available here on Amazon.  Notice how the handle goes through the dome on that one, compared to attaching to a hook on this one.  The closer your feeder is to the dome, the better it will be protected.  Just an observation that may help you with your selection process.
B000P71GLU I love this thing.  Without bending over I can make holes in seconds even in hard packed dirt, then just plug in the little plants and you're done.  I have lots of tree roots to contend with and with this tool, I know right away if the spot I've picked is suitable or if a large root lurks below the surface and I should move my hole a couple of inches.  The hole this unit makes is ideal for the small plants in flat trays--and of course, bulbs.  For larger sized plants, I can make several holes right together or just wiggle the auger to enlarge the cavity and so far have been able to make holes for plants in pots up to 3\" pretty easily.  I wish I'd discovered this thing years ago.  It makes spring planting soooo much easier.
B000P71GLU I have just about worn out the auger that I purchased here.  I started out planting bulbs.  Then found it was an easy was to collect soil samples several inched deep in untilled soil, was good to drill holes for installing deep tree watering ports and turning my compost pile.  It has worked for me in loose/loamy soil, southern red clay and rocky southern red clay.  It has done the job in all (using an 18 v drill).Advice:  If drilling into moist clay soil, it tends to drill straight down like a screw.  I have to hold it back to auger the damp clay out of the hole.After hundreds of holes, the lower half has worn to a cone but still works well.
B000P71GLU I had only one use for this digger and that was to help aerate the yard.  Red clay compacts easily and makes grass growing close to impossible without aeration.  Renting those big bulky machines is O.K. but I wanted something like this and this is fantastic.May 17, 2012 added:  Please add young trees to the list of Bye, Byes.  About now the Red Bud Trees have started growing to about 1' to 2' and they can really take hold in the soil.  I attacked them with the Yard Butler and by golly they are gone with a few turns and NO bending or backaches.  I continue to be delighted with this tool and it is always ready to use.The length (30\") reduces the need to bend down.  The hole diameter is better than the smaller types and works beautifully in most soils.  Rocks are a nag and depending on the torque set on the drill the Yard Butler will stop when they are too thick or not worthy of messing with the drill's abilities.  If the rock is too large perhaps digging it out would be more satisfactory.  My attitude is dig a hole as deep as it can go and the rest will take care of itself.  My initial trip at drilling the yard centered on bare spots and I drilled holes about 2\" to 3\" apart to cover the hole.  Return trips included inspections to find other weak grass spots with the objective of reducing the compaction.  So far so good.  Not much apparent wear on the drill yet.The best part of this gem is the \"weed attacker\" aspects.  Put the point on the crown of the weed and turn the drill on.  The tool literally winds the weed onto the tool and all I have to do is take the weed off the tool.  Gone are the roots and the weeds.  So far I have only used this on mostly chick weed and one or two dandelions.  Earlier applications of weed killer eliminated most of the dandelions but like MacArthur, they will return.Great tool for exactly what it is to be used for.  Thanks for making my life a little easier.
B000P71GLU I have the shorter version of this roto digger, but needed the extra length for my back, what a great back saver this is. I use this for annuals also so I don't have to bend so much. Love, Love, Love.
B000P71GLU I got this to do some spot holes in my rather hard packed lawn and it is perfect. I use it to make &#34;spot&#34; areas to overseed grass,I drill a series of shallow holes close together, spread the seed, the cover over.a lot eaiser than doing the whole lawn.note that you will need a 3/8 inch drill.Mine has an adjustable torque, so I can set it and if the drill gets bogged down, it just will stop, then I can reset and start again.
B000P71GLU With almost 400 bulbs and perennials to plant I knew my spade would not hold up (or my back).  Popping this little guy on the end of my drill made the job a breeze.  Be careful to set your clutch low enough that you don't twist your wrist off should it hit a rock or hard spot.  400 holes and it still digs like it did on the very first hole.  This is one of my better purchases this year; really don't know why on earth I hand dug holes when for under 15 bucks I could have saved myself the trouble.  If you're a gardener, and don't have one -- buy this now.  Your only regret will be that you didn't get one sooner.
B000P7345G This is the only MG fert with Magnesium in the mix natively. It really does a good number as a General Purpose Fert for anything that likes a balanced diet ... Oh and Tomatoes really do like this one over the 24-8-16 mix which will just leave them flowering into October ... IHMO. ( Too much N compared to P and K you see, for a matto to go all the way. 18-20-21 is about perfect. )
B000P7345G This is the best fertilizer to supplement your container grown tomatoes.  Dissolve in water and feed every 7-14 days.  Special formula designed for tomatoes.  Contains Magnesium which helps prevent blossum end rot in tomatoes.
B000P7345G Yes, I know that too much watering makes your tomatoes a bit dull tasting.  So, I knew better than to over-water.  But, the fruit was just not quite as tasty as other years.  We routinely apply the Miracle Gro liquid fertilizer for vegetables, but something was missing.  So, I tried this fertilizer, and there was a marked improvement in taste.  Great product!  I just wish they made this in the bottled form that screws into the sprayer they sell for attaching to a hose.  It would be so much easier.  Maybe next year....
B000P7345G I have used Miracle Grow all year and my yields for all veggies and tomatoes are very high and the growth of my tomatoes is unbelievalbly big.
B000P7345G Plant food was shipped quickly, received in good order. If it is as good as Miracle Gro was in the past, I should have some outstanding plants and tomatoes. Good idea to put the food in &#34;ready to install packets&#34; in the sprayer. If you don' have the sprayer,just use one tablespoon per gallon of water and mix. Easy, huh? When feeding, be sure to wet the leaves as well as around the plant, since tomatoes absorb the nutrients through both areas.
B000P7345G This is a God send for all plants. It nourishes even dieing plants back to life. I would but it again.
B000P7345G REVISION: Below I said to stop using Nitrogen later in the season, but I have had to adapt that recommendation.  Over the last two years, early blight has stricken tomatoes nation wide, including places where it was relatively rare like New England.  Entire farms have been wiped out, especially organic farms.Early blight can be treated with a fungicide, but you need new stem and leaf growth to compensate for the leaves and stems lost to blight.  You will have a smaller crop at the end, but losing the plant will result in many fewer tomatoes.I found after several of my plants succumed to blight (no tomatoes, a couple of branches of leaves, etc.) that providing the rest a good dose of late season nitrogen helped them enormously.So, I would suggest now, until the early blight has run its course (maybe never) you should use Miracle Grow Tomato Plant Fool all season and don't try to overinduce the flowering and yield of your tomatoe plants.  Two live healthy plants with average yield are way better than one dead one killed off by blight.Watch for youtubegarden.com, for more info.--------------------------------------------------I always plant with manure (raked into the soil, about one 25 pound bag of dehydrated manure per 10 plants, about 2 feet apart and spaced 3 feet per row) and some fresh garden top soil (just placed in the hole where the plant is, not throughout the garden).If you remember, it is good to mix in lime as well about a month or so before you put the tomatoes in the ground.  It helps by providing calcium to the plants and helps prevent blossom end rot.  Although, I rarely have had any problem with that here, it can depend on your soil, so better safe than sorry.  If you forget, don't worry, things will work fine without it for the most part.I plant the tomatoes deep, relative to the size of the plant.  1/3 down into the soil or more depending on the size.  Before I do I place fresh garden top soil in the hole and water it.  Then I place the plant firmly in the muddy mixture and surround it with more fresh garden top soil.  I have not found that different brands of gardening soil are better, so any cheap bag at your local gardening shop will do.  I have never lost a plant doing this.  People talk about other ideas like using 80 degree water to water the plants or using special techniques to keep from hurting the plants.  But I have never used any technique like this.  Hose water is fine as is rain water.I do not fertilize my tomatoes until a couple of weeks have passed and they have rooted and grown a bit.  I let the manure, new garden soil and lime do the job.After that, every two weeks, I apply Miracle Gro, and when I do, the plants are more vigorous, grow faster and I have fewer problems with the plants such as discolorations of the leaves or bug infestations.  I have heard numerous folks say to use less or more than the directions, but you know, the 1 Table Spoon per Gallon of water always has worked for me.  About a gallon for every three plants when they are young.  A bit more when they get to be 2 feet or more.  The box does twenty plants for the period of the season I use it.I use a bucket or watering can for mixing.  I have not had good luck with the automatic dispensers attach to the end of the hose and it seems to waste fertilizer.  But your mileage may vary.When the plants first start to show fruit and have reached about 3 feet, I stop using Miracle Gro and switch to a no-nitrogen fertilizer.  I find that by the time the plants are 3 feet tall, their root growth is fantastic and their leaf production is strong, so I want to focus on flowering and fruit production.  Something that reads 0-10-10 or even higher is fine.  Just absolutely no nitrogen.I have tried other fertilizers for my plants.  Nothing has worked better than Miracle Gro and some brands seemed to not work at all.  I have always been satisfied with Miracle Gro and stick to it for great tomatoes and strong plants.
B000P7345G Buying from Amazon with prime has really made shopping at local stores far and few between. I order this product from Amazon every year. This stuff will help and make you look like a person with a real green thumb for gardening. Just use one table spoon per gallon of water and pour. Use it every two weeks. You will be blown away how your tomato plants will blossom and grow. I didn't use it on two of the same kind of plants to see if I could tell the difference. Trust me on this..... Those two were half the size as the plants I used this on. So I know this product works better than it says it does. Try it and you will be amazed how good it honestly really works!!!
B000P7345G I like this because I can mix up a batch and use it any way I want. Spray, soak or dunk this is easy to use.  You don't need much of it so the 3lb bag will be in use next year too.  I'll buy more when this runs out, in a year or two. You know the only way I dont use this is in the hose sprayer it's made for.  I don't think it would last as long burning a bag that way.
B000P7345G I used this on my tomato plants and they seem to respond well to this treatment. You have to use it every week, but it doesn't take much and with last me this season.
B000P7FVX4 Bought this to use as a roof sunshade and a privacy shade on a side of the deck close to our neighbors house. Doubled up it functions *alright* as a privacy shade, and certainly more economic then any other options. As a sunshade for a roof you couldn't ask for more. It really does not reduce light visibility that much and you get the hot sun off of you. You can buy clips and fasteners for it from plenty of places, I just went with wood staples and they work great - no tears/rips or any issues otherwise. All in all a great product that I would recommend.
B000P7FVX4 This stuff is great.I installed some on top of my pergola.  I simply nailed the cloth into the boards with several dozen roofing nails.  We've had severe weather, hail, drought, and the fabric looks exactly as it did when I installed it.It definitely provides effective protection from the sun, though I did wind up modifying the design of the pergola to better position more fabric in the best spots.The price is hard to beat, and the stuff is forgiving and easy to work with.
B000P7FVX4 Easy to cut (minimal fraying), easy to sew (fold over once and stitch), and the selvedge edge is bound neatly.This 64-70% shade version is great for shading vegetable beds in very hot summer sun.  I attached it to my PVC shade structures with PVC grip clamps and they hold onto the fabric marvelously.
B000P7FVX4 good quality... holding up good so far. will update later if anything happens. i want more of this but at a cheaper price. i'm glad i bought it when i did.
B000P7FVX4 I have a deck with a high roof that at times in the day produces a lot of glare.  Shades work well for the 8 feet between a support beam and the deck floor.  We cut this to fit the top triangle above the support beam.  It does an excellent job of blocking the sun.  We have stapled it into place.  It is porous enough to allow for excellent air flow and has not torn or come lose even on windy days.Very please with this product.  I also have deck shades by the same company and am thrilled with them as well.
B000P7FVX4 Maybe I should have bought the \"authorized\" hanging tools but I used grommets and the fabric is ripping at that point from the wind blowing.  I am concerned about making it more secure as I am not sure if it will rip more if it cant move or rip more if its whipping around.But I do like the look of the fabric and that I can still see out through the fabric.  I would buy it again but have to get a better way of securing it and/or not use it in a windy area (not sure where that would be considering its designed purpose).
B000P7FVX4 I got a roll to cover my small patio.  It blocks the sun well, is sturdy. It is for sure worth it to get this product.
B000P7FVX4 We cut to shape and installed on the underside of our lattice patio cover to further block the sun.  It does a fine job.  Wanted something easily removable when wisteria covers the top and provides natural shade.
B000P9URDQ I bought three different kinds of mouse traps for some mice that have found a way into our home. I set it up last night and sure enough shortly after I went to bed I heard the SNAP! Dead mouse. Unfortunately this trap is a pain in the butt to set. There is a little plastic hook that holds the metal spring down and it just doesnt want to stay. After playing with it for a while I manage to get it to hold but I do wish it was a bit easier to set.
B000P9URDQ These traps are really effective; you place a small amount of bait (I use peanut butter applied with a toothpick) in a little bait-cup, close the cover, and slowly move the set-lever back until it locks.  Unlike traditional spring-traps there is no way I can see that you would accidentally snap your finger, unless you have them sticking into the entrance.  Getting it to lock  can be a little tricky, you really do have to move the lever down slowly.I think the secret to these traps is the mouse has only one way to approach the bait, so he goes down the little hallway and is lined up head-first and SNAP!, no more mouse.  I've caught two mice in the same night with the same bait.Update 09/2012:  I've been through a few of these traps over the years, sometimes the trap is in a rarely-visted place and the dead mouse gets nasty by the time I find it so I just throw the whole trap away.  I see these traps have gotten cheaper but a couple of the new ones I bought have broken after 1 or 2 uses, a little plastic piece breaks and you can't set the trap.  I tried to fix it using Gorilla Glue but without success.  Hopefully this isn't a trend.
B000P9URDQ A feature of this trap is \"never have to touch a dead mouse!\"  I find that pretty pathetic, because if you can't go through the trouble of putting on a pair of gloves then... I won't go into that.  Yes this trap catches mice, but it also catches and kills chipmunks and other rodents that do not create problems for humans.  The trap uses a conventional spring set arm that crushes the animal quickly and is therefore more humane than other traps. The problem with this mechanism is that it can crush the animal into a mess.  Maybe some people would get a kick out of that, but I don't. The most selective and humane way to trap is to use a Havahart trap, then euthanize only the problem animals with ether (found as \"starting fluid\" in automotive stores).  Ether is a potent anesthetic which was used on humans in early medical procedures.  It's also extremely flammable so take great care.
B000P9URDQ We live on a large lot that borders a freeway.  Some years we have trouble with mice in the fall and no longer have any cats.  We used glue traps for years.  Although they work fairly well, you still have to actually kill the mouse once it's trapped.We won't use poisons for several reasons and don't want to use the old fashioned, open snap traps because they present a danger to our small dog and us.I ordered two of these traps, which arrived quickly.  One of them was defective, but the other has proven to be very efficient.  I wish we didn't need it at all, but it works very well and is reusable.You can dispose of the already dead mouse without ever having to touch it and easily reset the trap.
B000P9URDQ So far I have spent $50 on two electronic zapper traps that my mice managed to enter, eat the bait, and leave (sans zap) and; $30 on four of these traps which the mice have thus far simply ignored leaving the bait behind (peanut butter) along with some mouse poop left right nearby as an F/U to me letting me know they were there and that they weren't falling for my traps.My mice have no reason to suspect traps as I have thus far relied on my two cats to keep the house mouse free and it hasn't been an issue for years. That is if you don't count the occasional mouse corpse left diligently just outside the bedroom door for me to walk on half-asleep the morning after the kill...Then recently I started noticing mouse poop but no mouse corpses and assumed the cats were't keeping up their side of the deal. So, loving electronic toys, I got the expensive Thomas Edison style electrocution mouse traps which failed, followed by these which also failed. So I guess the little critters are smarter than I thought and the cats are back on Tuna.I gave it two stars instead of one because they appear well made for the money and I still think they look likely to do the trick if your mice are of the low IQ variety.In any case these are batting a zero so far but are still baited as are the zappers. Time to try something else.I promise to update this if they ever come through.UPDATE: A month and a half into this one of the D-Con's came through and I got a mouse using peanut butter.  Bumped these up to three stars.  Only three because I still have mice...Update#2: These traps = 4 kills - Zapper traps = 2 kills. I appear to be mouse free now. Cats are fired!
B000P9URDQ I've caught many mice with this trap. This is just the traditional trap with a cover so you don't have to see the dead body, just the tail. What else can I say? I've caught at least a dozen mice with this. Very occasionally the mouse will clean up the peanut butter without setting off the trap but I just bait it again. About 3 times, the mouse turned around and set it off facing out. I have no idea why a mouse would back into it, but the trap killed it all the same. The entry hole is pretty big so that it can catch some pretty big mice.
B000P9URDQ I bought two of these traps, and the first night, I caught a mouse.  I also purchased two other types of traps for comparison, and think I will continue to purchase these when I need to.  I love that you can set these with one hand.  When the mouse is caught, you don't have to see it, just lift up the flap, and push the lever to release the mouse into the garbage.  Then it is really easy to reset.  I am really excited to catch another mouse now!  Sadly it's been two weeks since I caught the first mouse, and I am beginning to think I only had one mouse. I highly doubt that, but I will be grateful if I only have one.
B000P9URDQ Didn't like it, returned it, it didn't work at all.  I trap mice all the time in the metal wire cages, and this caught nothing.  Sorry, charlie--useless to me.
B000P9URDQ I ordered 4 of these traps after I saw a little mouse run across the garage floor. I used a pea-sized dab of peanut better for bait, as recommended in the instructions, then set two in the garage along a wall and the other two in our basement storage area, where I noticed some mouse droppings earlier.The next morning the two traps in the garage each had a mouse - and today (the second morning) there was another mouse in one of the basement traps.It is sort of gross to see the mouse's hind-end sticking out of the trap, but I used a bag for each to pick them up and then tied it shut and took it outside to the trash. I know the instructions said the traps are reusable (which they are) but I guess I'm a wimp -- I'd rather order new ones (which I just did). But if you wanted to reuse the traps it is very easy to do so -- you can release the snap mechanism without touching the mouse.The only (very minor) thing was that three of the traps set on the first try but the last one was a little tricky - I had to repeatedly mash down the lever to get it to set. And then if I even bumped it the trap snapped shut - on a hair trigger. But I finally got it in place along a wall in the basement and set it (that is the one that caught the mouse last night).I also have 4 of the round-type of traps that are designed to close when a mouse enters -- you can't see the mouse if it's inside but will know one is in there because the spring-mechanism moves from \"set\" to \"caught.\" So far those haven't caught any mice  so looks like I'll stick with the product on this page. Glad to get rid of those mice.
B000P9URDQ The hook that holds the metal bar in place doesn't work on mine. I know that if I didn't have a defective trap, it would have probably worked... but who knows with my mouse. It's managed to set off but avoid 1 Snap-E trap and 3 ordinary d-Con wooden traps. I was hoping this would do the trick, as I've had to move the food in my cupboards and pantry twice and tape up any and all openings, no matter how small and it seems to be working. I guess I'll have to manage life with a mouse in my kitchen. I don't want to use poison because the mouse hides in places I can't get to and I don't want it's dead body stinking up my house.
B000P9URDQ I hate the idea that I have no choice than to kill, I tried the humane way for 5 years, but they are overunning my house, since I have chickens and mice are attracked to the feed etc.I bought several different types and the mice beat the trap and got away with the goods.  Not with this trap, I put it under the sink with some cheese I had left over and within ONE HOUR, no joke, I had a mouse, I was a little taken back to see his little legs and tail sticking out but I am sure he could not have suffered since this thing is quick.I will buy several more tomorrow now I can put them everywhere not being afraid it would hurt my dig or cat, yes I have a lazy cat. I had a terrier that brought me  mice on a regualr basis, she is gone now, guess that is why I have a problem.It is Oct.09 now and I am mouse free, I found their exit from the attic where they were making a home and making lots of noice. I placed the traps in their path under the sink.  This trap caught 14 mice in less than 2 weeks.  Unfortunately one was not killed and I feel bad about that, but he was not really hurt because he ran off outside. I also found a few in the garage.  Funny thing when you scare them away as long as you keep the traps open they will be afraid to come back, I think it is that way.
B000PBXESO We found the hummingbird feed very easy to set up. We mix our own sugar water and have lots of hummingbird visitors. We have enjoyed watching them as they use the feeder.
B000PBXESO With this feeder hanging outside my office window, I see hummers feeding on it all day long. It's easy to fill and hang, easy to take apart and clean, and the hummers can't get enough.Living in the southwest desert, the hummers around here have a particularly hard time finding fresh nectar sources throughout the year. It gets so hot here in the summer that the nectar in hummingbird feeders either ferments or completely dries up within 5-7 days. The feeders here need to be cleaned and filled with fresh nectar twice a week.With this feeder it's easy and painless to take down, clean and refill.The hanging hardware works well, everything seems to be fairly durable.I'm planning on ordering a second one soon, I could not be happier with the one I have.
B000PBXESO This is the best Hummingbird feeder I have ever purchased. I can actually fill it enough to leave it hanging for two weeks, even though I have more and more hummingbirds attending. The bottom has a built-in perch all the way around so the little guys can actually rest while they are drinking. What a concept! Very easy to fill and clean.
B000PBXESO I've got beautiful blown glass and antique glass bottle feeders I just adore, but none of them hold nearly as much nectar as this beast does.  Come the end of April, my swarm of hummers is back and hungry - I keep them all out and need to refill 5 feeders at least once per week.If your garden is heavily trafficked by humming birds, this feeder is great.  If not, the nectar may turn to vinegar before they finish it, so a smaller size or lower fill level might be better.  I never color the nectar (the red colorant chemicals can cause the laid eggs to be thinly shelled and easily broken).  The birds find the feeder by the bright red plastic dispensing bottom without complaint; no need to color the sugar-water.
B000PBXESO I bought 2 hummingbird feeders at the same time since the little cuties can be so aggressive. I bought 2 different brands. This one was my favorite at first as I liked the way it looked. However, its not going to hold up. The metal ring at the top is not attached in any way and the nectar bottle will fall through from time to time even though I don't even fill it half way. This has caused the plastic \"bowl\" at the bottom to break. This red plastic nectar holder is actually in 2 parts. One of the two pieces has broken slightly from all the falls to the ground. It is holding up for now...but will probably need to get tossed at the end of this season.If you're curious, the other feeder I purchased was this one: It is holding up much better...B00004RA8P
B000PBXESO This feeder isn't all designery like those made by Perky Pet, but hummingbirds seem to like it better, it cleans up reasonably well, and none of the materials are toxic to birds (no copper or zinc galvanization as seen on many other products).  There's no paint to peel off like has happened with the other brand, and the red color is what seems to attract hummers most reliably.
B000PBZFJK I have 3 feeders hanging on my deck - this is the &#34;go to&#34; one.  I don't know why, but I guess &#34;pretty&#34; has nothing to do with their choice!  Easy to clean, assemble.  No drips or spills.
B000PBZFJK These feeders are very well designed. I have 3 Best-1 feeders hanging outside my office window, I see hummers on them all day long. The feeders are easy to disassemble and clean, seem relatively durable (unless you drop them), and most importantly the hummers love them.I originally ordered and have been using the larger version of this feeder, theBest-1 32oz. Hummingbird Feeder. I was so happy with it that I decided to order two more.After trying the large 32oz. version I decided to go for the smaller 8oz. version, mainly because it gets so hot in the summer where I live. If I put the 32oz. feeder out full of nectar, it will ferment and go bad in just a few days, before the hummers can drink it all. The 8oz. version is exactly the same product but with a smaller bottle attached. The bases look identical and are the same size.The small bottle on the 8oz. version is easier to unscrew from the base, easier to clean, the hummers drink most or all of the nectar before it goes bad, and it's easier to see how much nectar is left in it.If you live in a cooler climate then the 32oz. version is probably a better choice because you can fill it up and leave it out longer, but if you live somewhere that gets hot enough that you have to change the nectar several times a week like I do, then these 8oz. bottles are the way to go.The hummers here in the southwest desert have a hard time finding fresh nectar in the summer, so it's really fun to set up a little sanctuary for them. These feeders are perfect for it.Hummingbird Nectar Mix======================For the nectar mix I am using 1 part sugar to 4 parts water, boiled then cooled. One drop of trace minerals added after the mix is cool. A great trace mineral to use isLiqumins ConcenTrace Trace Mineral Drops, Low Sodium, 8-Ounce Bottle.
B000PBZFJK Easy to clean and fill. I don't get a lot of hummingbirds but the ones I get are here year-round so I have 3 of these and they get plenty of use. I did have to order extra bases because some of them seem to break easily. The birds love having a place to perch as they feed.
B000PBZFJK I bought the one with the small bottle and refresh it twice a week, The birds love it. The ants love it too but it is a death trap for them. They tell me ants are high in protein?
B000PBZFJK This was my first hummingbird feeder that I have ever purchased.  Arrived as described, though it is smaller that I thought it would be.  Have already made food and have it hanging, just waiting for the birds!
B000PBZFJK I buy hummingbird feeders locally whenever there are end of season sales.  Six or seven hang out in our very large yard at any given time; we've gone through many different styles and brands.  Best-1 hummingbird feeders have held up the longest (7+ years) and seem to be the hummingbirds' favorite.  As a matter of fact, the only time one failed is when a raccoon tried to drink out of one, the feeder fell, and the glass bottle broke.  With any other, you'd have to throw the whole thing away.  No problem here--replacement parts are made and sold.These feeders can be found elsewhere at cheaper prices, and replacements for either the glass top or plastic bottom can be bought separately.  Look up Nottawa Wild Bird Supply (can be found online) in Indiana.  They sell this 8 oz. feeder for $8, the base replacement for $5, or the 8 oz. glass top for $3.  I stop in whenever I'm in the area--it's a birder's paradise.
B000PBZFJK The bottle is glass and I like that because glass clean easier than plastic.Haven't used it yet, but I like it because it's small and I got two of them so hummers have more to choose from
B000PGOON8 Given the cost of this unit, the water reservoir capacity, and the fact that it only fits certain types/sizes of pots, I think I'm better off just asking my neighbor to hit my fussier plants with some water from my hose if I'm going to be out of town for a week or more.
B000PGOON8 The instructions that come with the CobraCo Plant Sitter are terrible.  In order to make this product work, you must (1) fill the container with water (nothing else mixed in), (2) wet the ceramic cone, (3) fill the ceramic cone with water, (4) make sure the plastic tubing is at the bottom of the water container, (4) start the siphoning process, and (5) put the ceramic cone in the dirt up to the cap.The container is made for small rimmed pots only.  If you have a larger rimmed pot, you'll have to improvise or put the water container inside your pot.  The problem with putting the container inside of your pot is that the water will siphon out quicker than if hanging on the pot, so you'll need to monitor your plant to see if it is getting too much water.  The container is see-through, so you can eye-ball the water level easily, but it is made of plastic, so time will tell how durable it is.Overall, not a bad product.  An adjustable hanger would have been nice to have in order to use the system on different types of pots.
B000PGOON8 I tried this while out of town for six days and it did not seem to work. The soil was dry when I got back even though the plastic container was still full of water.Other reviewers have left tips that I should try. Maybe then it would work. But the system should work more simply than that; it is basically a water container and a wick. And it is not good-looking although it is not real ugly either.
B000PGOON8 The lid will not stay snapped shut, thus the suction needed to draw the water into the plant is not present.  Could not get it to deliver water to the planter.
B000PGOON8 The concept is a good one, however, it's a little bulky and ugly and will only work on certain pots.  The system is too big to work on anything less than 8\" tall.  If you have a decorative pot that has a thick rim (over 1\") or overly curved, this will not fit.  I would use this for plants if I was going to be away for a few weeks, but it isn't attractive enough to have on my pots year round.
B000PGOON8 I followed the instructions that accompanied this loser and the results were poor. The lid on the tank will not stay closed. I had planned to use this outside but without the lid staying shut this would be an excellent hangout for mosquitos so I left it outside for only about a week and a half. I dropped (pushed would be a better word) the \"hose\" through the hole in the lid. Instructions say insert it until the tip reaches the bottom. I pushed the entire \"hose\" through the hole and it never reached the bottom but remained suspended in the water about two thirds of the way down. The tank hangs on the side of the pot all lopsided and really looks as tacky as all getout. No water ever transferred from the tank to the flower pot during the week or so that I left it outside.Not sure where this was made although there is a USA address on the cardboard but it does not say \"manufactured in\". However I would not blame any manufacturer for not wanting to admit to making this butt-ugly and worthless recycling candidate.There has to be a much better offering of plant watering products than this. Look elsewhere for something that has at least a smidgeon of quality which this does not. Stay away from this - far, far away.
B000PGOON8 I have pretty much given up on the CobraCo 6000 Plant Sitter. The instructions that come with the plant are basically useless, leaving the user to try and figure out how to make this thing work. It seems simple enough. Fill the reservoir with water, connect the hose, and stick the watering thing in the dirt.But it isn't that simple. The water doesn't seem to flow on its own. I have tried several things, from mounting the reservoir at different heights and trying to \"prime\" the tubing with water, but nothing seems to work. I did read that there is a way to get it to work, but I had already given up at that point. It seems like if you are going to make a product that sells for $17 and the only thing it has to do is water a plant, that you would at least provide instructions on how to do the one thing it is made for.I can't give it 1 star because apparently some people have figured out how to make it work, and so apparently it isn't totally worthless. But for wasting my time, and frustrating me, I will give it 2 stars. I should also mention this thing is ugly and won't clip on to pots that have a thick rim, like some ceramic pots. It is also made of very cheap plastic, not high quality plastic like tupperware or rubbermaid products. Overall, this thing is not good and I do not recommend it.
B000PGOON8 As many have said, the lid will not stay shut which can impact the suction through the hose.  It is ok, but I believe that they could have made a higher quality version and charged more as there seems to be good demand for such a product.
B000PGOON8 I have to say that this little thing has worked wonderfully for me. I have read that it does not work for bigger plants but that works out for me since the one I use it on is a smaller one. It is very easy to use although you may have to figure it out yourself since some have had trouble with the instructions. Luckily everything was fine for me and this thing works. I am away from home a lot so this really works out well for me. I recommend this to any one with a plant in need.
B000PGOON8 I held great hopes for this gadget.  We have a 20-inch pot on our upstairs desk, containing a brugmansia.  We needed a plant there to shade the window, but it's a hassle keeping it watered. Perhaps this would cut down our daily watering to every other day.Unfortunately, it didn't work for this purpose.  The lid to the plastic container would not stay closed, so perhaps that's part of the problem.  Also, the curve of the plastic container wasn't wide enough to accommodate a a pot this size.  I tried sitting the container on the ground, though, and that didn't improve the function.Judging from another review here, I might be able to use the wired device in another container. But right now I don't have time to engineer that.Kudos to the manufacturer for the handy video instructions. Very clear.
B000PGOON8 This watering system only fits on medium/large sized pots, and I wouldn't recommend it for use as your sole watering system. However I have a bad habit of only watering my plants every few days, and this has worked well to pick up the slack in between.The design concept is interesting and quite functional, however the materials used are not particularly high quality. It would be a better use of money to create your own reservoir and purchase water sensors from CobraCo (CobraCo 6001-TC Replacement Ceramic Watering Sensors) or another company.
B000PGOON8 FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS, if you do that and pre-soak the ceramic spike, then fill the spike and the tank with water this system will work VERY well. I've been using the ceramic spike for years now and they have never failed me. Now they're just bundling the spikes with a water tank, which is convenient. This tank is probably only good for a few weeks with most plants, but you can use a bigger tank if needed. I've used up to a gallon tank without a problem.
B000PGOON8 I'm not the world's best organized as far as remembering to water my plants, so this plant sitter is ideal. I have it \"sitting\" a plant that's perched up on a high credenza in my office that I have to get up on a stool to water--- hence it sometimes gets missed. With the sitter I don't have to worry about it anymore--- I can see clearly from the tank when I need to replenish its water. Very handy for me and very pleased to have it.
B000PGOON8 The Plant Sitter is a product designed for those who'd like to have their plants watered automatically over a period of time. It contains a reservoir for the water and a ceramic sensor to trigger water release when the soil gets dry. You will need to carefully follow the instructions and test-run it to make sure it is properly watering your plants. Some users need to make adjustments to get it working sufficiently, such as changing the position of the reservoir, taping the lid closed, adjusting the sensor insertion spot, etc. It has a decent cosmetic appearance and hangs easily on most plant containers - I have a variety of potted plants on my patio and it fits a majority of them. It seems to usually work well when used as directed but there are exceptions and if you expect it to work fine for every plant and without any adjustment then you could have it ruin a plant. The mechanism for how this functions is simple enough that someone could create a similar system on their own using parts that are less expensive. Thus, if you have a lot of plants that need automatic watering it would be expensive to buy a lot of Plant Sitter packages - you'd probably want to find a more inexpensive system. Thus, I'd say this is an option for those with no more than a few plants that may need watering when there's temporarily no human around to do the job - and you should first test run it when you are around to ensure it is functioning as intended.
B000PGOON8 This arrived just as I was about to leave for four days, and the plant I most wanted to save was an outdoor potted plant. I knew this was not made for outdoor plants, but I figured I'd try anyway. That was a useless effort; I came back to find the tank completely dry and the plant dry, too... I guess the tank just evaporates easily in hot weather.Anyway, then I tried it for its intended use. I placed it in a small potted houseplant and it has watered for 7 days-- the soil is nice and moist and the tank is about halfway down, just as the literature says (up to 2 weeks of watering).PROS:-Works as intended-Camouflaged colors-- the green blends in with the plant, so it's not a big, obvious device-You can use it with your own water container, too, if you want something bigger (as long as the hose reaches the bottom)CONS:-Expensive. How many people have just one houseplant they want to save? At this price, you could rack up triple digit expenses just to keep your plants watered.-The top doesn't stay closed. You'd expect there to be a tab or something to keep it \"clicked\" closed, but nope. It just sits there. My cat hasn't knocked it over yet, but it's just a matter of time, I think.-Doesn't fit \"almost all\" containers as advertised. I've tried it on several small containers, and it doesn't stay on them. Not a big deal in my case, though, because my plants are on a countertop and I've just put the tank behind the plant instead of hanging from the side of the pot. Also won't work for hanging plants-- it tipped mine sideways from the weight.Overall: if you have just one or two indoor plants you really want to save while you're away, this could work well.
B000PGOON8 2nd UPDATE:The sensor was empty today. I thought I made a mistake the first time this happened. Since this has happened three times & the two sensors I've been using for years still have water in them, there must be something wrong with the Plant Sitter. I noticed that the Plant Sitter feeding tube is smaller in diameter than the sensors I've used for years. Maybe that's the problem. I don't know for sure, all I know is that the Plant Sitter sensor is not siphoning water like it should be.My rating went from 3 stars to 1 star.UPDATE:After setting this system up using 3 sensors (one that came with the plant sitter & two I previously owned), I thought everything was working normally. After a few days I checked each sensor again to be sure each was full of water. I was surprised that the sensor that came with the Plant Sitter was empty again. The other 2 sensors were full of water - like they're supposed to be. I soaked the empty sensor for 15 minutes then re-filled it with water. I will check in a few days to see if it is empty again. If so, I will update my review & reduce the star rating.~~~~~~~~~~~~~ORIGINAL REVIEWI've used self-watering probesSelf-Watering Probes - Package of 5for indoor & outdoor plants successfully for many years. I use gallon milk containers as the water reservoir.  The CobraCo 6000 Plant Sitter works the same way way as the ceramic probes I used in the past & it comes with its own 1 quart reservoir.To use self-watering ceramic sensors:~Remove cap~SOAK the ceramic cone/probe  10-15 minutes in water (Cobra forgot to add this important step to its product label instructions)~Fill the cone/sensor ALL the way to the top then recap it.~Push the ceramic sensor into the soil. I always make sure the ceramic portion is completely pushed into the soil.~Fill the reservoir with water.  To feed  your plants, add a little liquid fertilizer to the water.~Drop the feeding tube into the water reservoir making  sure it rests on the bottom. (For the Cobra Plant Sitter, drop the end of the tube through the center hole on the reservoir's lid)~Cover the top of the reservoir so that the water won't evaporate & so mosquitoes won't get in if you're using it outside. (The Plant Sitter has a lid, but the lid doesn't snap closed. To keep the lid closed, I put a rubber band around each side of the reservoir. If I was using the Plant Sitter outside, I would cover the center hole & the feeding tube with aluminum foil)~IMPORTANT: Always set your Plant Sitter up a week before you leave to be sure it's working properly. (I noticed that the water level in the reservoir hadn't changed in a week. I pulled the ceramic sensor out, removed the cap & saw the cone was completely empty...that's why it wasn't working. I filled it back up, put the cap back on, pushed the sensor back into the soil; by the end of the day, the reservoir's water level was going down)...see my UPDATEA few tips:~Larger plants will need at least two ceramic probes/sensors.~Depending on type, size & season, a plant will require from 8 ounces to 32 ounces of water weekly. I find that for my plant in a 6\" pot, the Plant Sitter's one quart reservoir will water it for approximately 2 weeks.~If you rely on the Plant Sitter to always water your plants, you should water the plant from the top once a month.~The level of the water in the reservoir should be below the cap on the ceramic sensor. Raising the reservoir increases the flow rate; lowering it reduces the flow.~If the reservoir runs out of water, you need to refill it & you will also need to refill the ceramic sensor.The Plant Sitter's reservoir is a nice translucent color, not flashy or showy, so it won't detract from your plant. It's too tall for some of my smaller indoor plants. So I sit it near the plant instead of hanging it on the pot.I added two more sensors & am using the Plant Sitter to water three plants at a time. The center hole is large enough for me to thread two feeding tubes through it, but I had to put the other tube under the lid; two rubber bands are holding the lid closed. I'm sure the reservoir will need to be filled  often, but the plants have been so thirsty lately that I haven't been watering them enough. I'm expecting happier plants by using the Plant Sitter.Amazon's product description is confusing to me. It mentions both a 1 quart reservoir & a 2 quart reservoir. I received a 1 quart reservoir & one ceramic sensor.Made in ChinaThis is a 4 star product, but I deducted 1 star because an important step was not included on the product's label instructions & the lid doesn't snap closed.~~~~~~~~
B000PGOON8 This device is designed to provide you plants with consistent water over a couple weeks, like when you go on vacation. Now the water reservoir is rather cheaply made. The lid does not close properly, I had to place a rock on it to keep it closed. Now if you look above, you can get the Hydrospikes by themselves and use almost any bottle or jug with them. This model works best when you don't have any place for that jug as it attaches to the side of the flower pot. You can also use multiple hydrospikes to one jug to water multiple plants or one large pot.Now the one thing to keep in mind is that you do need to \"prime the pump\" by soaking the terracotta sensor and pouring water into the hydrospike to get the water flowing. You may also need to do this occasionally if the water stops or runs out for any reason.If you have a lot of flower pots, are forgetful when it comes to watering and especially if you have a tendency to over water your plants, then this is a great tool for keeping your plants healthy and alive.
B000PGOON8 The Plant Sitter Automatic Watering System is really just a simple water siphon consisting of three parts: A curved reservoir that can hang on the side of a pot or stand free, a thin coiled hose, and a pours ceramic cone (they call it a \"sensor\") attached to one end of the hose. Setup is simple: FIll the tank, soak the \"sensor\" in water until well saturated (this takes 10-15 minutes), insert the sensor in the soil, and you're done. The ceramic cone is the key here. From what I can tell, It prevents dirt and particles from being drawn back into the hose, plugging it, and it provides a lot of surface area to help draw water into the pot while preventing the siphon from immediately draining the reservoir.I set up my Plant Sitter in a 12\" pot containing a few ivy cuttings I'm starting. I've placed the pot on my side porch, where it'll get sunlight but will be sheltered from the rain.  Everything appears to be properly configured according to the instructions. We'll see how it looks when I return from my vacation next week.
B000PGOON8 I tried this in my guest room, where I have a few plants that get forgotten. After following the directions, I put this into a pot of Emerald Gem that had been recently divided from the mother plant. It was doing great because I was remembering to water it.This watering system didn't work well. A month after installing, there was still water in the well. The plant was very droopy. I'll try again with a different plant and see if I get better results.
B000PGOON8 I am evaluating this product winter 2013 when indoor environment is extremely dry. The houseplant sits facing Southern window connected with the watering system. Instructions are so easy to follow. I fill the reservoir and ceramic sensor with luke-warm water. The system does the watering for me. In about two weeks, I re-fill the reservoir.One more thing about the watering system is that it may take a while to \"calibrate\" the system. If you notice that the water level in the reservoir does not go down, the system is not properly calibrated. Simply refill the ceramic sensor. Repeat the process if necessary.
B000PGOON8 I was excited for the Plant Sitter to work, but alas, it must have gotten distracted and focused on playing on its cell phone when it should have been tending to the plant. Alas, so hard to find good sitters these days. :)Really, though, it's a good idea, but just didn't work for us. Maybe it was operator error, but the thing really didn't come with a lot of instructions.We placed in to tend a tomato plant that we had in a pot about 14\" in diameter.As we checked on it, it seemed that the water level in the Plant Sitter container was going down, so it seems like it was watering, but it just wasn't watering enough, and the tomato plant really struggled.This may be the type of Sitter that needs a watchful eye, but then, what's the point?It could be used as a backup for watering if you're prone to forget to water everyone once and a while, but as a main source for watering on a long vacation, I'd think twice about, unless you test it really well before you leave and are confident that it provides enough water for the size of planter you have.
B000PGOON8 When I was first offered this product for review, I thought \"What a great concept!\" Since I live in a condo and do container gardening outside, I decided to give this product the ultimate test by using it on the container for one of my tomato plants. It stayed there all summer and into the early fall.First off, you're supposed to soak the ceramic piece that's going to go into the soil in water. I totally didn't see that part of the instructions at the time, so that clearly could have impacted the plant sitter's performance that first week or so.  You then put the ceramic piece into the soil and put the long thin tube that is connected to it down into the plant sitter water well that hangs on the side of your plant's pot. Super simple and quick to install.The first problem I encountered is that the LID of the water well would not stay shut. This may not have been a problem if I'd been using it for an INDOOR plant, but it certainly was a problem with an outdoor plant, because all the bugs, dirt and other detritus that swirls around the parking lot of my condo could go right into the water. Over time, even if I occasionally poured out the old water and put new in, a green gunk grew on the inside bottom of the water well. I can't say exactly how much this impacted the plant sitter's ability to keep my plant watered, but I suspect it clogged up the tube somewhat.The end result was that, when comparing my two tomato plants in exactly the same containers with exactly the same type and amount of soil, the plant with the plant sitter generally needed less watering. HOWEVER, in no way would I have been able to rely on the plant sitter SOLELY to water my tomato plant, so I still watered with the hose when necessary (especially during that part of our summer that was over 100 degrees). I could see a small to medium house plant that didn't have a great need for water being able to survive over the long haul with this plant watering system, but not a large plant and not likely one (like my Spathiphillum) that constantly droops unless it is well and regularly watered.I would definitely get another plant sitter for an indoor house plant IF the company could fix the lid problem. The fact that the lid refused to latch and stay shut was a constant annoyance to me this summer...and trust me, I tried many times to get it to latch. I think I succeeded ONE TIME out of an entire summer of tending to my tomato plants...but it didn't stay closed for long.In summary, this plant sitter is a GREAT concept for those who want to have plants but travel often and don't want to pay someone to water their plants while they're gone. It is easy to set up and easy to use. If it hadn't been for the lid issue, I would have happily given this product 4 stars.
B000PGOON8 Although not a bad concept, and upon seeing it you think, \"Why not?  I'll give it a try,\" this item works better in theory than in practice.You can't really rely on it to keep your plants alive.  I think another review said you had to siphon the thing first.  That kind of takes away the \"automatic\" idea.  Maybe my expectations of the product were a little too high, and my review sounds a bit harsh, but when I see automatic, I want something truly automatic.Not only that, the system is a real eye-sore.Maybe plant sitting technology is still in its infancy and hopefully it will improve in the future.  I'm glad to see other users were able to get something out of the product.  I wish CobraCo the best of luck and hope they can some day live up to my higher expectations.
B000PGOON8 This does work.  It enables you to give your plants access to water when you are not around to water them.  But it's not exactly a needed product, even for dedicated plant lovers, since it none too hard to set up your own wicking system.  That would do the same job, and do it for a lot less money.So: it works.  No problem.  But...needed?  I don't know.
B000PGOON8 The COBRA 6000 PLANT SITTER works OK for what it is, however, the company didnt print the correct instructions for its use. You will NOT get any water moving into the watering stake, unless you syphon the water thru that hose. The instructions only mention filling up the stake with water. So, first fill up the water tank. DO NOT ADD ANY FERTILIZER. (You dont want to get that in your mouth.) Next, twist off the cap over the watering stake, and fill it up with water, RIGHT TO THE BRIM. Then, CAREFULLY put the cap back on. Now, SYPHON the water thru the hose, and when its flowing, then attach the hose to the plant stake. Place the plant stake as close to the roots as you can get it, without damaging them. Lastly, either hang the tank on the side of the planter, or place it ABOVE the plant's soil level, so you get good water flow. The hose's opening should ALWAYS be at the BOTTOM of the tank. The instructions remind you NEVER to let the tank run out of water, or let the water lever fall too low inside the watering stake. If you do, the syphoning suction will break down, and you'll have to initiate the syphoning process again.DOES THE COBRA 6000 WORK? Its OK, tho other self watering systems I've seen, use TWO of these watering stakes per planter. Unless you have a SMALL plant, just one stake wont moisten all the dirt in your planter, to the detriment of some of your roots. Also, the water tank is designed to attach to the side of a planter. However, its TOO BIG for that to work, unless you have at least a one gallon sized planter. It claims to water a plant UP TO 3 WEEKS. I guess they mean a cactus. I found the water tank to run out, after about 7-10 days.BEST METHOD FOR KEEPING YOUR PLANTS WATERED DURING VACATION.1. WATER THE PLANTS THOROUGHLY before you leave.2. COVER THE DIRT WITH WET PAPER TOWELS, or wet rags. Then, cover over the planter with a plastic bag. This will hold a LOT of water inside your planter. For outdoor plants, skip the plastic bag, cos you'll want to get whatever rain you can inside the planter.3. PLACE HUMIDITY TRAYS NEAR THE PLANTERS. Lack of humidity will cause extra evaperation thru the leaves.4. DONT PLACE IN DIRECT SUN. You'll want to get your plant to go almost into hibernation, while you're away.5. USE A WATERING SYSTEM LIKE COBRA 6000. I've seen people take a 1 liter plastic bottle, fill it with water, plug it with a rag, and place it upside down inside the planter. The water will slowly drain thru the dirt. This is good for BIG pots, and plants that like wet feet, like tropicals. The COBRA 6000 is a sophisticated version of that same method of watering, that works well for small planters.Overall, the COBRA 6000 works, but only on a smaller plant. If the plant is too big, the stake cant get water thru the WHOLE root system. Rememeber, to syphon the hose before use, make sure the opening is placed on the bottom of the tank. Also, keep the stake filled with water too. Best results were optained from placing the tank ABOVE the planter's rim, not hooked on the planter's side. If you place the water tank upon the rim, as the drawing on the cardboard container suggests, the weight of the filled tank might tip over the planter. Also, its less likely to work well, as the tank drains.Overall, a cheaper alternative to the more expensive, multi-pot watering systems. However, the vague, incomplete instructions, and the watering tank that's designed too large to hang on the planter's rim, might spoil this product for some.
B000PSFLT2 While I tried to swear off any more awful Chinese plastic hose accessories, favoring far better US brass stuff when available (not often), this was the only configuration that would work for my irrigation system without redoing the whole thing. Cheap and with a lot of optional ways to hook up stuff, and the shut-off valves are very handy.Although plastic threads usually fail after awhile, this device seems well-made with decently formed threads, a brace kit useful for some installations, an upper brass coupling and the valves work smoothly and are big enough to operate fairly easily.I had to take off a star because a somewhat similar, and discontinued, Orbit manifold sprung a leak right in the middle of the body and sometimes guilt by association is hard to deny.
B000PSFLT2 Plastic Manifold has Brass Coupler, 2 plastic End Caps, and 3 plastic Ball Valves for a total of 1 entry and 5 exits to the manifold.Ball Valves work smoothly and shut off completely.Manifold comes with a steel brace, mounting screws,  and instructions.To avoid the extra work of drilling holes in the block wall, I didn't use the enclosed steel brace. Instead, I measured the installed length of the Manifold to the ground at the intersection of the wall -- cut a length of White Schedule 40 PVC to fit, and have an easily-removable brace that's a plenty strong.I mounted a RainBird Pressure Gauge on the center valve -- an Orbit Digital Timer on the right that feeds a RainBird Gear-Drive Sprinkler -- and a 37' hose with a Bel-Aire Nozzle on the 3rd port for durability and versatility.All this behind a Valterra A01-1122VP High Flow, 55-lb Lead-Free Pressure Regulator -- ALL available here at Amazon.My order arrived promptly and in perfect condition. Thanks, Amazon !!
B000PSFLT2 I bought this to hook up a hose and two sprinklers at the same time, so I don't have to constantly switch hoses depending on which item needs use currently. Works great, made it through the first year. Each hose outlet has a on/off control valve which it's good. You probably won't be able to run 3 items at one time unless you have great water pressure in your home - or if they run just fine at low pressure. I definitely recommend bringing it in over the winter so it doesn't crack and leak. I've had two Gilmour two-way splitters before and they only lasted one year before they started leaking, however I didn't bring them in for the winter - so that may be the cause.
B000PSFLT2 I have this set up with two soaker hoses at either end.  Since they are so light, there is no need for me to use the anchor that came with the product.  For my needs, this product is just right!
B000PSFLT2 I have two of these, they are both working very well. I am very pleased with them and will buy more if the need arises.
B000PSFLT2 This is great to use in the garden I currently have two hoses attached to it and this helps me to get all over my property, we have 4 acres. I se it daily and have not had any problems.
B000PSFLT2 This was easy to hook up and is a life-saver now that I am trying my hand at landscaping and have several hoses going all over the yard. My only complaint is that it sometimes leaks, but I'm not sure if that's an error on my part or if it's the product itself. I also think that the hoses sometimes get stretched (as in, pulled slightly away from this product when they're in use), so the seal isn't as tight as it should be. It's easily fixed.Also, sometimes, for the same reason as above--stretching of hoses as they're used--the gold part on the top (that attaches to the main faucet) unscrews a bit and starts leaking. But you just have to twist it back on tight and again, probably only happens because the hose is being stretched.
B000PSFLT2 Kind of a cute little gadget and does serve a purpose. The supporting arm provided was useless so have to invent one of my own.. It sure makes it convenient to have several hoses at the ready and don't have to mess around disconnecting  and re connecting to change hoses
B000PSFLT2 The Orbit 3-way faucet valve is absolutely great so far. One or two reviewers almost scared me off by saying you should get the metal one instead, but I had a metal 2-way faucet valve and hated it. It leaked, it was too hard to turn the dials and it was surprisingly insubstantial for metal.This faucet valve comes with a brace you can attach to the back to bear some of the weight of the hoses, but I didn't attach it and I don't think I need to. Everything is tight and sturdy as can be. Maybe the angle of my faucet coming out of the wall makes it unnecessary to have a brace. After my experience with my last 2-way faucet valve I bought some washers for this one, but I haven't needed them at all. Not a drop of escaped water. I run a hose to one garden, a hose to a second garden in the opposite direction, and a hose across the yard to a dog pen. I had forgotten that sometimes I need water at the faucet for other things as well and was thinking about getting a 4-way faucet, when I realized the end cap screws off and there is your 4th outlet, and even a fifth one on the other side.I love this thing. It has solved so many problems for me. And again, it's sturdy! Nothing moves when I yank on one of the hoses. What a difference from my \"better\" metal one!Update -One month of constant use later: This connector has had a workout. Everything still works smoothly. I guess that is what impresses me most after having struggled with a brass connector. The individual dials turn sooo easily and when they are off, there is no leakage. This whole thing is so well made.Another update -One year later I am having to buy another one. I think the couple of deep freezes we had this winter did it in. But the price makes it painless to replace.
B000Q5S7RM I had an issue with my order that the seller resolved immediately, so I won't detail that.Once my worms arrived I opened them up and gave them some water before placing into the soil.  The box was a lot smaller than I anticipated; I was envisioning 4-6 inch long fat worms in a box the size of a gallon jug or bigger.  The box was about 8\" square, and the worms were TINY- average was an inch, inch and a half long.  But I've no doubt there was 1000 in there.  Once it warms up in SoCal I'll be buying several more boxes for my garden.
B000Q5S7RM It's not every day that a bag full of lively worms land on your doorstep. Several generations of these worms have feasted on our compost pile ever since, leaving everyone happy.
B000Q5S7RM Arrived on time and included a bunch of live red wigglers.  I didn't see any dead worms and my worms have been thriving in my composter.  They also started mating right away... I don't know if that's a sign of adjustment or not but they do seem to be very happy worms.  I would definitely buy from this company again.
B000Q5S7RM Healthy, live, wiggly worms. Put them in my compost bin and hopefully they will do the job. If they migrate out to the rest of the yard thats fine. I will be back for more.
B000Q5S7RM Ordered in March going to Fl. And they arrived quickly and all alive. The worms are happy and thriving in my compost bed. They are already improving the crappy dense non draining pile of fill that I have been putting my household compost in. I noticed the hump in the middle is going down faster and it's getting more like soil rather then muck fill. Still has a long way to go before I can plant but the worms are definitely improving the quality and airation. Gotta have worms and this company was a good choice to get them from!
B000Q5S7RM I bought these because I am having a problem in part of my lawn with compaction.  I have some heavy clay under my soil.  I have aerated my lawn, but it just need some more help.They arrived packed well, and had a cooling pack to keep them from getting too hot.  They also included a sheet of instructions which I highly recommend you read before putting them out.  I did not find any dead worms.  In the instructions and FAQ with this company they stated that the worms may seem a little thin from being dehydrated from shipping, but mine were fat and healthy.I followed the instructions and put them out in one spot and covered them with damp newsprint, after loosening up the soil (I used a pitch fork).  They started wriggling down into the soil right away.  I checked the next day under the newsprint and did not see a one, so I am sure they are happy underground,  and I am looking forward to them helping my lawn.
B000Q5S7RM I'm trying to think of something to say about a bag of worms.  They're worms, right?First of all, there were several dead ones.  Of course I didn't count them, but there were enough to notice the difference between the moving worms and the motionless/limp/lifeless ones.  I guess some perishing in transit might be normal, I don't know.Second, there were some critters other than worms.  Some of them look like miniature centipedes, others are just little wiggly things.  I guess it's inevitable that you'll have supplemental detritus-eaters, but actually I was expecting only worms.Hopefully these are the last worms I'll ever buy.
B000QD7MZ2 This is supposed to be a hummingbird feeder, not a nectar fountain....... It IS big, and once assembled, it looks attractive. It was fairly easy to assemble except for the little yellow centers, which kept popping out and flying onto the floor, but once that was taken care of the unit was impressive, looked very nice.Adding the cylinder, which I had thankfully  filled only 1/3 with sugar syrup, was an unwieldy process, But  I did that over the kitchen sink and once I mastered that and everything was in place, and the feeder was ready to hang on my balcony -- that was when I noticed the syrup dripping out from UNDER the red flowers. Had it been dripping out from under ONE of the flowers I might have been more forgiving but ALL the flowers were leaking. Nuh Uh --  I just installed a new balcony rug and there is NO way I am going to hang that on my balcony.Like some of the other reviewers did, I will disassemble it, and GLUE the flowers on to see if THAT helps. If that doesn't work then this product is  waste of everyone's time.
B000QD7MZ2 PROS- large size, individual perches, easy to hang bailCONS- all plastic, including the nectar bottleThe main advantage of this model is its large size, so if you have lots of hummer activity, you won't run out as fast.  Also, being plastic, it doesn't weigh as much as those with glass bottles, though of course once you fill it with a larger amount of nectar it weighs more.However, I do wonder if some of the plastic from the bottle is getting into the nectar.  We try to avoid plastic packaging in our house, what is this plastic doing to the hummers.  Also, I wonder if the clear plastic bottle will discolor or scuff from cleaning over time, in a way that glass wouldn't.The bail (hanging loop) is larger and easier to manipulate than on other hummingbird feeders I have, but it still gets in the way of standing the bottle up straight when filling it.  If they had made it just a bit larger, or designed the plastic bottle to have some recesses in it for the bail, then the bottle could stand up straight when needed.
B000QD7MZ2 I'm not sure that the hummingbirds around here will be enough to drink up all the nectar before it spoils.  It holds 48 ounces, which of course is a quart and a half.  So be aware of that if you don't get lots of hummers around your area.The base is a little hard to clean, as it doesn't come fully apart.  I usually run it through the dishwasher on the top rack with the heat OFF.  So far, so good.  I wish it had an ant moat like my other feeder, with that one I can fill the top little moat with water and keep the ants from getting to the nectar.The nectar chamber is made of plastic, so it's not as heavy as if it was made of glass and less likely to break.  The base simply twists into place.  It has a large metal bail which is easy to get on and off my hanging hooks.  It has 6 feeding stations with perches, so multiple birds COULD feed at once, but we have a male here who runs off everyone else if he's anywhere around the feeder!If you're looking for a decent, sturdy feeder that holds a LOT of nectar, then this is the one for you.  The box also states it is made in the USA, which was a BIG plus for me.
B000QD7MZ2 I have yet to find the perfect hummingbird feeder, and I've gone through a lot.  This feeder is no exception.While it holds a lot of nectar and has six ports, I find that hummingbirds are too territorial to allow more than one family to feed -- one male, one female, and, eventually, a couple of juveniles.  The huge capacity of nectar is wasted since it must be changed twice a week to avoid bacteria and mold.At first, I absolutely loved that it didn't leak while hanging in its place -- and then I had to change the nectar.  The moment I moved the feeder, nectar poured out of the spouts and over my hands.  It was even messier when I turned it upside down to unlock the base.  I was covered with sugar water. I'm sure the ants had a field day below.The feeder comes unassembled, with no instructions.  It was pretty easy to figure out, although if the flowers aren't all the way in, the feeder will leak right away.  Everything is plastic.  This feeder is much easier to clean than others.I just wish someone would make a bee-proof, non-leaking, easy-to-clean, easy-to-fill feeder.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann
B000QD7MZ2 I do love the size and the 6 ports to feed from but I can already see it is hard to open and fill and get closed right again so it doesn't leak. I don't really expect this to last more than this season. Don't get this size unless you have a lot of hummers coming because you should refill your feeder and clean it once a week so if you fill it full and don't have enough hummers to use it up there will be a lot of waste. If you don't need that much just fill it half full. You can always add more if needed but be sure to clean your feeder every time you put more syrup in it for them to drink.You really need to push firmly on each piece as you put the feeder flowers on and the center parts. If they aren't on right they will just fall off so you'll know if you did it right or not. The stand for the hummer feet are on securely because they have little cut outs for them to fit tightly before screwing them tight onto the feeder. Just take your time putting these features on so you don't break them.UPDATE: The little yellow centers in each flower that are snapped in independently are coming off. The Orioles keep playing with them and they are coming off even though I had them on securely. Now there is an opening large enough for any bird, fly, wasp, etc. to get into the juice. Not a good thing. When this is empty I won't use it again. Spend more and get a nice glass feeder, they are the best.
B000QD7MZ2 Early May is the start of humming bird season around our house so the arrival of the Perky-Pet feeder was very timely. Like clockwork, the little critters came looking for food and my wife was able to put the feeder in the garden in time to satisfy a small flock of these fascinating creatures.The feeder holds a lot nectar and that's both a blessing and a curse. The blessing, when there are a lot of birds feeding, you don't have to refill as often. The curse, the base doesn't come apart and because of its internal corners and seams, it's hard to clean.The tube is easy to clean but the base is somewhat inaccessible making it hard to get spotless - important because around here, mold forms quickly.The small perches are used by the birds, giving us a good long look as they feed.Overall, a good product and recommended if you are a careful and dedicated cleaner. Else, keep shopping.
B000QD7MZ2 This has been a great year for the hummers in our yard.  Have two nests, each with two eggs and a source of pleasure just watching.  The one feeder that we have had just doesn't hold enough and a royal pain to clean.  So glad we were able to get this---it holds plenty of our \"nectar\" and refills a lot less often, very easy to clean.  The really great feature is that this holds 48oz of nectar.....enough to last more than a day!  After years of feeders in our yard I can honestly say this is the cream of the crop----I'm thinking the hummers agree!  A great product for so much entertainment in our outdoor space.**May 17, 2014  This update is an unhappy one! Our huge feeder now has a leak underneath, along the bottom of the base...what a mess!  We had it hanging in a tree and thought that the wind was causing the feeder to sway too much, losing all of the solution.  We decided to place it on a stable post to correct the problem...wrong!  The plastic base piece is open for easy cleaning, but actually consists of two attached pieces that do not make a good seal .  We are totally disappointed with Perky-Pet concerning this flaw in design.  Hopefully, the company will soon address this issue, and figure out a way to make a bottom piece that is solid. but easy to clean.  This also applies to the models that have two separate bottom pieces that Really Leak!  We like Perky-Pet products, and hope that the solution to the leaking problems will be soon!
B000QD7MZ2 Who can resist the tiny delicate hummingbird?  I love seeing them in gardens at flowers such as coral bells, honeysuckle, columbine, delphinium, trumpet vine and other plants that tend to have a bell like blossom.  This feeder when filled with a syrupy liquid will attract the lovely creatures too but it is a bit of a pain to put together and if the user is not very careful spills and leaks are a fact of life.  Holding forty-eight ounces this is the &#34;grand master&#34; of hummingbird feeders but I still prefer the old fashioned method of feeding them with flowers thus receiving the additional benefit of more beauty and color in my yard.
B000QD7MZ2 While it's attractive, it's way too large. I prefer having (several) smaller feeders. Party because hummers are territorial they like having &#34;their own&#34; feeder to go to. And a feeder with 48 oz. of nectar is going to take a long time for the birds to empty. Probably one will never fill it  more than 1/4 full. Nectar liquid goes bad in a few days, especially in hot temperatures.  All the red color on the unit itself is bound to attract, but I prefer glass feeders these days, they hold up better in the hot sun and with time.
B000QD7MZ2 This hummingbird feeder does its job. It's much larger than many others on the market- 48 oz. Its constructed of plastic, but seems relatively sturdy. Other people have had problems with leaks, but I haven't experienced any after 2 months of use; (if any do develop I'll update the review). One thing to keep in mind for first time hummingbird feeder buyers is that you have to buy special food so that the hummingbirds don't starve to death on sugar water. They need nutrients, and it's only fair for you to know that ordering this feeder won't be everything you need to get up and running.It's easy enough to clean, although for people like me who don't like to take the time to disassemble, clean and dry multiple parts it's not fun. I'm not aware of any alternatives, just something to keep in mind because I'll either make the effort to pull apart and hand wash my juicer or the birds', but not both. Only one of us will get our nectar!
B000QD7MZ2 There are many different styles and sizes of hummingbird feeders. The hummingbirds don't seem to care as long as there's fresh nectar (sugar water).This 48 ounce feeder is BIG. Unless the hummingbirds we get would consume 48 ounces within a couple of days, this size is overkill. That's because when the daily temperature hits the 90's, a couple of days is the most we can go before replacing the nectar and cleaning the feeders.I don't know about the store bought nectar because we make our own (3 parts boiling water to 1 part sugar), but it can go cloudy in as quick as a day during the hottest part of summer. Cloudy is bad, as are visible black floating specks. It means contamination.As long as the nectar doesn't get contaminated, cleaning is pretty easy, it's really just a matter of rinsing. However, once there's contamination, a full out washing is the only way to feel it's safe to use again.For me, the best feeders are the ones that are the easiest to use and the easiest to clean. This one fits the bill; it is easy to take apart, fill and clean.On the negative side, I had a knee jerk reaction to the plastic bottle. Only time will tell, but I have had plastic feeder bottles that became brittle and / or cracked in as little as one summer's use. (Probably due to our mountain location where summer temps can hit 90 during the day and drop to the 45 at night.)For my purposes, this feeder is okay. Of all the feeders that we have tried, I like Perky Pet's, but prefer their smaller ones. I start with putting a couple out in April and add as the hummer population grows. By July, when the Rufus' come in, we have a dozen in different places about the deck. These are my favorite:Perky-Pet 8109-2 Antique Glass Bottle Hummingbird Feeder-16-Ounce Capacity, Redand thePerky-Pet 447-12 Round 10-Ounce Glass Hummingbird Feeder.
B000QD7MZ2 While this is one of the larger hummiingbird feeders, it lacks in quality. First, it's all plastic, unlike their other product, the 209B. It also came with the drinknig stations unassembled (though the other model comes assembled). There were also twice as many pieces sent - is this a mistake or intentionally wasteful? So while this feeder is functional, it just isn't nice as a glass one.Please toss away the included food. It contains dyes that can be toxic to birds. It's unconscionable  that Perky-pet is including this nasty stuff with their feeders. Just mix 4 parts water to 1 part sugar and you'll be good to go.
B000QD7MZ2 This is not your typical Perky-Pet hummingbird feeder simply because our hummers avoid it often.  Even after setting out fresh food along with the other Perky-Pet models, they only visit this feeder when the other 4 are busy with birds.It should be the center feeder with all of its features attractive to birds and old geezers.  The birds voted with their feeding habits and have said they are not too interested.  The humans like a large, 48 ounces in this case, feeder; however, unless a large eating population has arrived the 220 (this one) goes stale.  We probably refill more often than necessary, but, I'd rather do that, especially in the beginning of the season, to encourage their eating at our stations.  The 220 has 6 'seats' for the birds and when you watch them, they will sit there, socialize and eat for a short time and then begin a fight with the arrival of the Alpha Hummer.The top has a built in moat and that is a nice feature since it does keep out the ants but not the wasps.  There is nothing that I know of that will eliminate wasps, but do we want to?  The hummers do not seem to care.  They just go to another feeder.  I do not care for the plastic feeding tube.  On the first two refills, it leaked and it was my fault for not tightening the bottom to the tube tightly.  Because it is a light plastic tube, the wind blows it easily and in doing so the food comes out of the holes.If the birds begin enjoying this feeder similar to the other ones, I will edit this and make necessary changes.  Of course, there may be reasons to downgrade it also.
B000QD7MZ2 This just came today in time for hummer season this year. Anxious to see how well it holds the large about of feed that it is rated for. The lid seems a little wonky to screw on, so we shall see. I expect this to last about one season with the critter activity we have here. Went together fairly easily and should provide a lot of feeding stations for the birds.
B000QD7MZ2 This feeder is great.  It is easy to clean.  No more sticking something down inside it try to clean stuff out.  The base does not come apart but there is plenty of room for a dish brush or cloth to get in there and clean.  I was slightly disappointed that the nectar holding part is plastic.  For some reason I thought it would be glass.  We will see how it holds up in the weather but so far so good.
B000QD7MZ2 Perky-Pet 220 The Grand Master 48-Ounce Hummingbird FeederCategory: Accessories...One can never have too many Hummingbird feeders! :)Notes after using the Perky-Pet 220 The Grand Master 48-Ounce Hummingbird Feeder for a couple of weeks:  In the box, one finds 1 Perky-Pet 220 The Grand Master 48-Ounce Hummingbird Feeder, 6 red flower-shaped medallions, 6 yellow (coin sized) inserts with feeding holes for flower-shaped medallions, 6 perches and 3 metal screws -- all in individual (clear) packets.Note, the feeder is not fully assembled (and Mine didn't come with instructions). so, just grab a pair of gardening gloves and press one of the (included) red plastic flower-shaped medallions into each of the 6 holes on the base of the unit -- *snap* -- . Next, press one of the (included) yellow coin-like inserts into each of the red flower-shaped medallions.  The (included) perches will need to be screwed into the underside of the base with a flathead screwdriver (not included). One will find 3 pre-drilled holes, one for each of the perches. When finished, there will be a perch above each of the flower-shaped medallions for the little Hummers to rest on while sipping nectar. Done!The unit is made of a very sturdy, thick, plastic. Cleaning the Perky-Pet 220 The Grand Master 48-Ounce Hummingbird Feeder, for the first time, was quick and easy. A normal sized bottle brush did the job.The nectar reservoir is crystal clear, making it easy to see the nectar level from a distance. The opening is large, making for easy filling or cleaning.  The large base, with six feeding ports, easily screws on, or off, the feeding reservoir for refills or cleaning. One fills the reservoir when the unit is upside down, screws on the base and flips unit right side up, then hangs in designated place via a sturdy metal hanger built into the cap. The red cap -- at the top of the unit -- also screws off, providing a flat surface for filling the unit. Nice!Perky-Pet 220 The Grand Master Hummingbird Feeder has a 48 ounce nectar capacity --  that's 6 whole (8 ounce) cups of nectar. This will make the feeder a bit heavy, so one will need to select a sturdy hook, or tree branch, to hang it from. The large size, and weight (when filled with nectar), of the Hummingbird feeder, keeps the wind from blowing it back and forth. It is also large enough to be seen from a distance, making it a very nice focal point in the garden or on the patio. There is no ant trap/moat on this Feeder....Neighbor-envy... The Hummers flock to my new Perky-Pet 220 The Grand Master 48-Ounce Hummingbird Feeder ..  *smiles, sips espresso*tip:  this is the nectar recipe I've used for years:  add 1/4 cup of pure cane sugar to 1 cup boiling water -- stir till clear -- let cool -- add to Hummingbird feeder. Change out once a week...Does the Perky-Pet 220 The Grand Master 48-Ounce Hummingbird Feeder, sound like what you may be looking for? :)  Highly Recommended!  --Katharena Eiermann, 2014
B000QD7MZ2 As a brand I like Perky-Pet Hummingbird feeders the best this one I have some doubts. It comes in a box and you need to assemble it no instructions included but it is obvious how to do it. My fear was you have to press so hard on the plastic red flowers to snap into the base it would crack, same with the yellow rings. It did go together without cracking. The top that holds the bottle seems to come off too easy I fear if the feeder if full it may fall to the ground. The one thing that really disappointed me is the built in metal hanger is just a tad to long to slide over the shepherds hook without spilling some of the sugar water out onto the ground.Last Summer I read that the red dye is hard on the kidneys of the hummingbirds so I make my own sugar water and they drink it down faster than I can make it. I hope this year adding 2 large feeders it can be a once a week fill and clean. It is early here yet the scout hummers are out as one came to my window 3 times last week where last year I had a window feeder that broke. I do have this one out now but I didn't fill it I do want to make sure my regulars know they can count on food again this year.If the unit does fail I will come back and update my review.
B000QD7MZ2 We have another Hummingbird feeder with small perches, and we've found that Hummingbirdsdo use the perches, and in doing so allows us to watch them longer.This large and roomy Hummingbird feeder is 25\" around the base (7 3/4\" dia) which allows ample roomfor the birds to share six feeding ports, which is nice since Humming birds are rather territorial.It's well made, and the plastic of the six perches are flexible, durable, and are a nice large size (1 1/2\" wide)The feeder doesn't come with instructions how to put it together, however, it's obvious how it belongs.Except for the yellow buttons which took a second glance to understand they snap in rounded side up.The 6 buttons and 6 flowers are quite firm to snap together, but the flowers easily pull out to clean.And the yellow centers punch out easily with a slotted screwdriver.A very nice 48 oz feede
B000QD7MZ2 The hummingbirds and orioles love this feeder.  There is a place for their cute, little feet.  So do I love it.  It is easy to take apart and clean.  I use little brushes.  It holds a lot of liquid so I do not have to fill constantly.  I have a number of feeders going at the same time and have at least 50 hummingbirds humming around all day long in the summer.  I hang these feeders in the shade of a tree.  Would definitely recommend.
B000QD7MZ2 I have three different feeders in my backyard and this seems to be the favorite. Sadly, my hummingbirds fight so, at most, I'll get two hummingbirds carefully spaced. Even so, they don't want to go to one of the other feeders but rather fight over this one.They don't share very well, so it's really kind of big since I change the solution regularly.The one thing that really brings this down to three stars for me is that the diameter of the lip of the top that fits into the base is too big. First, the top needs to be inserted, it goes down about a half-inch, and then it is turned and locked into place. I was having a very difficult (and messy) time getting the top to fit. I finally had to shave off some of the rim around the base with a razor. Happy to say that I still have ten fingers.It is easy to clean and I don't have a problem with the vacuum effect that I've had with other feeders.So, it's a five for the hummingbirds and a three for me -- average is four.06/22/2014: I changed my review to a three today. Even though I've tried to shave away some of the plastic on the base, it's still a tight squeeze. Today while trying to maneuver the container onto the base, the whole thing slipped, spewing sugar water all over my kitchen. Now I should also add, \"the ants give it a five.\"
B0016KV73W Used it numerous times in less than 60 days! My daughter was potty trained the first weekend of November 2013. I took this with us on a trip into my office for a backup plan. She has great bladder control (can last upwards of three hours). We left the office after three hours and put her in the back of my SUV with the potty and me (not a ton of extra room but we managed....wanted to give her some privacy from prying eyes :)) she never saw this thing before. She sat right on it and did her business (#1). This portable solution fits in a large tote or purse. I have used it to attach to a regular toilet on the go (just used it tonight at a friend's house at a child's bday party). Very easy.The liners are good. No leaks. I purchased extra liners too. I haven't tried rigging a regular plastic bag with paper towels yet. Afraid of leaks.With newly potty trained tots, I think you need a convenient solution for an immediate need. Buy it!
B0016KV73W I'll cut to the chase.PROS:Here's the brilliance of this potty seat:1) the \"wings\" (which serve as the base for the seat when in stand-alone potty form) that flip out to put on the adult toilet seat are secure and heavyweight;2) these same wings have rubberized grippy bits on the ends, which keeps them from slipping around on the adult potty seat;3) the base of the flipped-out bits can serve as a grip for the child inclined to grab the (*ack*) public seat.We've used this primarily as a portable potty seat, because we have another portable potty chair in the back of our van.  It fits neatly into its plastic bag, and the plastic bag fits very easily with room to spare into our backpack (which we use instead of a diaper bag). But I can see this working well for that function, too.CON:1) the hole is small, which makes wiping a newbie a little challenging.  (It doesn't bother me, because my child stands to get wiped at this stage.) I suspect some ankle-grabbing would suffice.  It doesn't pose a problem for the function, just, potentially, the cleanup.Overall: win!
B0016KV73W I love this potty! Much easier to use this then hold my 14 month old son over a regular toilet every morning to do his business! We part time EC, and this has been working perfectly, wish I had bought it sooner! He loves it set up on the floor, & has become much more interested in going #1 in the potty as well!To those complaining that it collapses on their little ones, you don't have it set up correctly. You need to push the legs into the potty base till you here each side click. I highly suggest watching YouTube videos on potette plus set up.I purchased the silicone reusable insert for the potty so we don't have to mess with bags... Much greener and cheaper! I bought the potty & liner for $15 bucks, you really can't beat that!
B0016KV73W This is so perfect. We go to the beaches all the time and there are no bathrooms and a child learning to potty can't hold it til we find a toilet somewhere. This works perfect. Small, easy, secure. I love that it also comforts to a toilet seat to put on an adult toilet seat in a public restroom. I use it most though for our beach trips. The liner you can buy for it works great but when I run out and haven't ordered none regular grocery bags work just as well.***edit. Oct. 5th, 2012 I had to order another one since we lost or had our stolen when we were getting some maintenance done on our car and it was in our car :( but soon as i realized it was missing I was online ordering another one because this is the best invention in the world especially for long trips, beach trips, or out anywhere that just doesn't have potties, especially for a little one that can't hold it like adult can, when my 2 year old says I have to potty she has to go and go NOW so its great to have in the car when there just isn't a store or gas station around for her to go potty at. I ordered 3 packs of refills with my original purchase and still have 2 full packs left LOVE LOVE THIS product and so does my daughter she has no problem going on it***
B0016KV73W Pros-Travels easy (it fits in my diaper bag) & it has a travel bagSecures great on the pottyYou can do it as a free standing for out & about emergencies ( they have an insert you can buy)It gives my toddler confidence that he's not going to fall inConsIf you use it as a stand alone the legs have to be locked in & it was a little hard for me to snap into placeI've bought 2 - one for home & one for travel. He loves it, this was the only thing that was worth a darn besides the primo potty
B0016KV73W This seat is such a convenient thing to have! It is small enough to put in a backpack or diaper bag and it comes with a storage bag. It makes sitting on public toilets easier (for kids and parent) and could be its own potty in an emergency. The only reason that I deducted a star is one design \"flaw\" that I'm not sure if they could do anything about. The front bottom is shaped/sized so that if my son's aim isn't down enough, it will actually cause the stream to start splattering. He's usually good about it and it isn't the end of the world to clean up a little, but I think it could be better in that respect. Would definitely recommend.
B0016KV73W This is extremely handy for an outing, especially when potty training a 2 year old. It took me some time to figure out how to lock the legs in place, but it's not a big deal now. My only complaint would be that the legs are so short, so even my two year old's knees end up in his chest. But I guess that's what you get for portable.
B0016KV73W This potty was a total impulse buy for me, before we started potty training my son.  I thought it looked cool, and I was pregnant with my 2nd, so I bought it on a whim.  However, it was SO worth the money!  We are outside a LOT, especially at parks/playgrounds....and I'm not going to lie, I just can't handle the port-a-potty.  I can't do it!  So, this has really saved us from having to pack up and go home early.  We keep it in the back of our car, and just set it up whenever we need it.  We've never really used it as a seat cover, just as a travel potty.  I can fit it in my diaper bag, but it takes up a lot of room.  It would be nice if it were smaller, but for what it does, I highly recommend it!
B0016KV73W My almost 3 year old daughter falls through the opening when sitting on it. She also tells me &#34;it hurts my butt&#34;. It will be in our next yard sale needless to say. I was hoping this would work for her. I even tried putting her foam cushion from her home potty seat on the top and she still refuses to use it. The foam isn't a perfect fit and just makes it clumsy feeling to her. The opening is way too big for a typical child of 2 to 3 years of age in my opinion. My daughter is not petite either.
B0016KV73W My son is in the 97th percentile and about 2 1/2.  This thing was so tiny it was a joke.  I could see how it might be great if it was appropriately sized for your child, but it is definitely not the answer if you have a bigger than average kiddo.
B0016KV73W We initially got this for our petite 2 year old. He was already going potty in a little froggy potty (also bought on Amazon) and was doing so well but it became a problem when we would go out in public because he was terrified to use the large toilets. So we bought this and it solved the problem! So small and extremely easy clean up. He has even gone in the car with this little potty. Needless to say, he didn't end up using it a ton since he eventually got brave enough to use a normal toilet but we still keep it in our truck in it's nice little bag just in case or if we need to use while on the road. Great product!
B0016KV73W The potette is really portable and well-made, but I think I was happier with my ikea potty - it took up a little more space and didn't fold down or convert to a training seat (which is cool) but at least I didn't have to use plastic bags with it (I don't buy the potette liners - they seem pointless. I just use an old plastic bag and a rag or cloth diaper in the bottom, and then wait until I'm somewhere I can offload the poop without having to send another plastic bag to a landfill). I would love to figure out an \"on the go\" solution for the potette that didn't require a plastic bag at all. On the other hand - the potette is thoughtfully made and small enough to fit my one year old, who much prefers to use a potty than a diaper.
B0016KV73W I bought this potty to keep in the car for when we are out and about. In the &#34;potty&#34; position (legs down) it isn't sturdy at all because the legs don't lock in that position. Twice it has collapse under the my baby which has led to epic meltdowns. So in reality it's just a travel toilet reducer. Not very 2-in-1.
B0016KV73W This was the best buy I could have done for the summer vacation on the beach. We went to Europe on vacation and it is usual  there not to have restrooms available on the beach so I was worried about how to handle my 3 year old potty training phase. I bought this product and it has proven to be phantastic!!! Clean and easy to use and comfortable for the kid. Size is also quite reasonable as it fits perfectly in the beach bag. All my friends with kids same age wanted to get it too.
B0016KV73W I bought this because I needed a portable potty for my son. He is fully potty trained but doesnt tell us he needs to go until he is about to pee himself. I was really tired to hovering him over the toilet (thank goodness he is small for his age or else id drop him right in) especially with a bad back and weak arms. I was really looking into the foldup ones for convenience but saw that it was not sturdy and did not fit public toilets. I am so glad i found this. it folds up nicely and is sturdy. I am so happy i read reviews because i found on another review that to use it in a sitting position/potty you have to push it up to lock in place. Anyways the day i got this in the mail my sister took my kids and me to the park and as soon as we got there my son was doing the pee pee dance. I pulled this out, popped the legs in place, popped the baggy in it, put it behind the tree, shimmied down his chones and plopped him on there. He was a bit confused cuz the bag and all but he did his thing and it was all gravy. We also used it on our toilet at home. He loves it. And i love it. =)
B0016KV73W A great little travel potty for early trainers, but the instructions are not complete.Pros:Small size is perfect for babies and young toddlers.Can be used as either a stand-alone potty or on top of a toilet, giving you options.Folds up very compact.You can use standard plastic grocery bags, just put a paper towel or cloth diaper inside.Cons:The legs are wobbly in the stand-alone potty position, making me a little nervous if my baby was too wiggly. EDIT: I figured out why the legs felt wobbly. You need to push them UP towards the seat to fully lock them. The enclosed instructions do not say this, but it's very important!!!The bags that are designed for the potty stink of perfume.
B0016KV73W My 2 1/2 year old was ready for potty training and we love his potty seat at home (which also sits on the toilet but is for all day use), but we are on the go quite a bit so we bought this potty seat.  He loves to use it!  It's compact enough for a diaper bag (or backpack which we use) and it worked great at Disney World.  It's pretty darn sturdy too.  I've even set it up in his carseat for him to go in a compact car.  Yeah, it's not as sturdy as a free standing training potty, but it's not meant to be kept at home on the ground for use all day.  I love that it sits on top of a toilet as well, which made potty training during a hotel visit a piece of cake.  I do NOT recommend buying additional bags.  A plastic grocery bag with a paper towel works just as well.  Just be sure to check the bag for holes first and have them ready to go in the car.
B0016KV73W We were happy our toddler has been successful with potty training with her baby bjorn potty chair, so we decided to get this for on the go.  Unfortunately, she is so scared and doesn't want to sit on the Potette.  =(  We have tried countless times and she refuses to sit on it.Read some amazing reviews and hope we would have the same luck with the Potette.
B0016KV73W let me just say this potty seat is amazing! It's sturdy, little enough to put almost anywhere, folds down great. I bought some extra liners, but in my opinion save your money & buy the reusable liner that goes with this seat. Also wonderful quality, and come on, how hard is it to dump out & wipe with a wet wipe.
B0016KV73W This is the best baby product ever invented!  It's cheap, sturdy & fits in my kid's skip hop bag.  We have had potty training success because of this gem!  She's going on her 3rd week of PT & this weekend we took her to Disney on Ice & a weekend trip to the beach.  The crowds in public restrooms I think intimidate her but I just put this potty on the back seat of the car in the parking lot & wha la! When the crowds are smaller I use the handicap stall & set this potty up on the side & we take a potty break together.  On the beach I set up her potty in a play tent & she had her own little outhouse.  She loves her new potty & so do I!  We no longer have to fear accidents or her holding it too long till she feels comfortable.  The liners are super absorbant so you don't have a messy, leaking bag to deal with.  I won't leave home without it.  Thank you inventers of the potette travel potty.  THANK YOU!
B0016KV73W Seriously, whoever came up with this invention is even better than Henry Ford for inventing cars; hands-down this is the greatest purchase I have made for my 18mo daughter...and we've purchased a LOT!  My daughter said \"potty?\" the other day while in public, and was terrified of me holding her over the big (nasty) public restroom potty and wouldn't go...so in the diaper it was, poor thing. So we purchased this potty on the suggestion of a fellow Mom.I was skeptical, as my daughter is used to a padded seat, that sits on our big toilet (we've gone that route and not a mini-potty...she's done amazing starting at about 16mos~) so I was a bit concerned on whether or not she would understand what this was (when used as a stand-alone potty on the floor/ground):  it came in the mail, I opened it, popped out the legs and locked them in place (**you have to pull them out to standing position, then push them upwards into the seat until you hear them click**) and set it on the floor...she immediately exclaimed \"potty!!!\" and sat down to hang out.  SUCCESS!!  From here on out this new travel potty was my bff.I keep it in it's plastic bag, in our diaper bag 24/7...it paid for itself twice already: having it at my parent's house 3hrs away to pop the legs to the side and put on the big potty, when I didn't think to bring her usual potty seat, and again when we were on the beach and she said \"potty\".  I don't go anywhere without it, ever.It comes with plastic bags that will hook around it, that they pee/poo into when you'er on the go, and inside is a little \"pad\" to soak it all up...don't waste your money on more of these specialty bags...use some plastic grocery store bags, and line them with the thick maxi pads...it's the same exact thing, and a FRACTION of the cost since you can buy cheapo brand pads.BUY THIS ITEM!!!!
B0016KV73W This toilet helped make potty training so easy for us. We brought it to the park, the playground, shopping. I was a little shy using it indoors in public (although would in a pinch so long as I could find a somewhat quiet, uninhabited corner somewhere), but had NO shame whatsoever having my daughter cop a squat at the playground or wherever outdoors. And when we were running errands, I would open the back of my SUV, and have her sit there and go. I would just stand in front of her for safety and to give her a bit of privacy. Also, when I was pregnant, it helped me avoid public restrooms and having to hold my almost three year old over a toilet, big belly and all. I cannot recommend this enough.
B0016KV73W We carry this with us in the car whenever we go out.  It has a little plastic case that comes with it, but we use that to store the bags, and got a separate (washable) bag to carry the potty in.  It's fantastic.  Going out to eat and don't want to balance your toddler on the big toilet seats?  Bring this along, lay it flat and your toddler is comfortable and protected from germs!  On a road trip and don't want to risk a gas station restroom, or your toddler needs to go NOW and you're on a stretch of open road?  No problem!  You click the potette into the \"seat\" position (note that people complain about the seat collapsing, but it won't do that if you just click the \"legs\" into their place.  You MUST click/lock it in to the upright or flat position, otherwise it's not stable), put it in the back of your wagon,  or in the back seat on a relatively flat surface, or on the side of the road even, your toddler sits down and pees/poops, you tie up the bag and knot it (please don't litter - just store the bag in the back of your car, or the trunk until you can toss it in the garbage - if you knot the bag, you don't smell it), and boom, you are on your way!  My daughter loves it - she prefers going on the potty \"in the car\" rather than going into an unfamiliar restroom, and on more than one occasion, it's been a lifesaver pulling over by the side of the road for an emergency pit stop.It's all plastic and is easily wiped down by a disinfectant wipe, and takes up little room when stored flat.  You can buy refill liners for about 50 cents a bag (I got a 30 pack from Wal-Mart for 40 cents a bag), which some might say is costly, but we only use them when we go out, so 30 should last us a long time.  When we ran out of our initial supply that comes with the potty, I did use plastic grocery bags (make sure there are no holes in the bag!) and some left over absorbent pads from my pregnancy kit.  You can save money by going this route, but you either have to carry around a bag of women's panty liners/pads and grocery bags, or do it up in advance and then fold them all flat so they are ready to go.  That seems like a lot of work to me, so we just buy the pre-made ones from Kalencom.The only \"negative\" I can comment on about this potty is that it's not ideal as your primary potty seat for potty training.  I like that it's all plastic for easy clean-up on the go, but we did end up buying a cushioned potty seat for at-home potty training.  When your toddler is sitting for a long time on the potty, cushioning is nice, and our daughter found this seat too uncomfortable when sitting for long periods of time.  However, now that she is fully potty trained, she could use this seat for everyday use at home just fine.Overall, I highly recommend the Potette and it's definitely one of our best purchases for our toddler.
B0016KV73W Great on-the-go potty because the sides fold in and it's easy to stash in a bag. Love that it's both a stand-alone potty and a toilet topper.  if your toilet is oblong shaped like ours, this potty seat will seem too small.  We always have to remind our son to point it down and to close his legs before he starts to pee.  Otherwise, it will almost always splash out of the gap between the potty seat and the toilet seat or over the potty seat - something we do not have a problem with on our Baby Bjorn toilet trainer.
B0016KV73W This potty lives in my car trunk and its great for car trips and has been used more then I thought it would be.  Only minor issue is the seat sometimes wants to close while my kid is sitting on it but I just hold her and for a 30 second potty break it works perfectly.
B0016KV73W This little portable potty chair has been a life safer as we have traveled around with our almost 3 year old
B0016KV73W This travel potty is on my \"baby must-have\" list.  We've used it while traveling on both long trips and short and also while camping.  It's great to use as a booster potty on those icky campground port-a-potties.  We keep it in the car just in case!
B0016KV73W This is one of my top five favorite baby/toddler items to ever purchase.  When my daughter needs to go it isn't an issue finding a clean restroom.  I highly recommend to anyone who is potty training and beyond.
B0016KV73W I really couldn't even tell you how many times this little potty has saved my daughter's outfits, carseat, my van, and my sanity. I don't use it in public restrooms as we have something else we use for those instead. I keep it set up in my van with a bag already lining it (we ran out of those little bags that it comes with, with the absorbent pad to help soak up the liquid, but in a pinch, sassy disposable diaper sacks work wonders!!), and that way when we get the opportunity to pull over there's no wasting time trying to set it up while she does the potty dance. Not sure how it works with boys yet, as my youngest boy has not potty trained yet, but time will tell.Here's what I like:-convenience. I don't have to worry about trying to find someplace with a public restroom to take her in. I can quickly get her on it, take out the used bag, replace it with a new one, and be on the go again in no time.-portability. It doesn't take up much space at all when it is folded up and it fits fairly well in my diaper bag, and j
B0016KV73W We have been so pleased with our &#34;travel potty.&#34;  It is so compact and perfect for traveling.  It fits easily in a backpack or large purse so you can use it anywhere.
B0016KV73W Awesome product.  I travel a fair amount and didn't want to delay or jeopardize potty training my toddler because of my fear of getting stuck somewhere without a toilet.  I used this mostly on top of public toilets for the first few months - and it was GREAT for that.  It reduced the anxiety of my little one trying to go in strange places, especially when he had to sit for a while to, ahem, produce.  We used it on airplane toilets, you name it.  Then one day we were about to get on a subway train in NYC and he announced that he had to go pee... I pulled out the Potette, had it set up in seconds, and he was able to sit and pee in comfort (if not privacy!).  You really do have to push the legs hard to snap them into place so it is sturdy - but if you do that, it is strong enough to hold my 35lb little guy without a problem.  I also love that this is super small, lightweight, and easy to carry around.  Can't say enough good things.
B0016KV73W Like many others here, I had to learn the hard way why the standalone potty won't stay put and the legs kept slipping out from underneath my toddler mid-pottying. It's because each side needs to be pushed to lock in. Then the only caveat is that the legs sometimes pop out of the potty when I pull it back out to unlock it but it's a very minor incovenience compared to having the most accessible potty ever, which is so crucial especially when your toddler is potty training...and especially on vacation...to large parks where restrooms aren't always super accessible (not to mention the lines!)...via a road trip. I can't imagine how we could've survived our last vacation without it. Best invention ever (my husband and I kept saying to one another)! I do agree/have to admit that the seat is very small and very low...but any bigger and it would be a bother to carry around. It's difficult finding the balance between portability and usability when it comes to a portable toilet, but this company certainly made it work.
B0016KV73W I had high hopes for this based on the reviews that I read. Unfortunately, it was a great disappointment. It's really flimsy and quite frankly too small to be of any use for my 2-year-old son. Despite following the directions, it kept tipping over every time we used it. Don't waste your money on this. I recommend the smaller version of the Baby Bjorn potty.  We use that now whenever we go out. The quality of the Bjorn is far superior to the Potette.  That's my .02.
B0016KV73W We have tried so many potty seats that I've lost count.  This one is by far the BEST.  It is compact and fits in my 2 year old's little backpack.  It is very sturdy, and she's comfortable because she does feel like she is falling in.  It cleans up easily, travels well, and is cute.
B0016KV73W Potty training was a terrifying prospect for me, especially being out and about. At the same time, I didn't want to be stuck at home for weeks/months until my toddler was potty trained. We live quite far from &#34;town&#34; and that was another fear of mine. So I bought this more for the &#34;travel potty&#34; use than the &#34;trainer seat&#34; use. However, on our first excursion out with it, we used it both ways, and it is so useful! It's small enough that it fits easily in my 14&#34;x14&#34; wet/dry bag, with extra liners, change of bottoms, wipes, and a cloth diaper for wiping up messes. It's really easy to whip out in the very short amount of time my daughter has between &#34;I have to pee!!&#34; and actually going.Like at least one other reviewer has said, it's important to know that if you're going to use it as a potty, you need to kind of &#34;lock&#34; the legs into place by pushing them up into the seat part. Then, to fold back up, you just need to carefully pull the legs out one notch. To go from folded up to trainer seat, there's no locking into place necessary.The liners that come with it are really amazing. The absorbent pad holds most if not all of the pee my toddler releases at a time (it claims to hold 5oz) so I'm not just carrying around a bag of liquid. At the same time, $10.xx for 30 liners (when my daughter, who is still in the early stages of potty training, can pee 5 times in just a few hours) can get costly. So we've found that the small plastic garbage bags (4 gallon) are much more cost effective. (Our grocery store has a generic pack of 30 for $1.67.) If I'm really concerned about the bag of pee, I can throw some paper towels or even a cloth diaper in it. I still plan to buy the Potette Plus liners from time to time as a luxury item, or maybe if we're going on a trip where we might not be able to dispose of the bags in a timely manner. =)I've read that plastic shopping bags like from the grocery store would work well, and I could see that. But I don't know about you, but most of our plastic bags have holes in them, plus now more and more cities are going bag-less anyway, so it's nice to know the small garbage bags work, too.I've never tried any other 2-in-1 type travel potties like this, but I'm very, very happy with my purchase.
B0016KV73W A friend had referred this product to me when she was potty training her son. It is small enough to take everywhere you go and big enough where the child is comfortable. I have two: one in the car (because who likes using the public restrooms?) and the other in my bathroom (because I have a small bathroom, no extra room for another toilet).
B0016KV73W I cannot rave about this product enough - it has been an absolute lifesaver!  I LOVE that it serves dually as a trainer seat on a large potty OR a stand-alone mini-potty.It folds fairly flat, so it's easy to fit in a diaper bag (or even a large tote-style purse).  It's awesome when on-the-go (whether long car rides when you just need to pull over for a sudden need to potty break, or at a fair/carnival setting when port-o-potties are the only other option - and who wants to put a little kid through that?).  It's also great even for vacations or going to other's houses.  My daughter is very petite, and cannot sit on a regular-sized toilet or she will fall in.  We bring this everywhere with us.1000% worth every penny.  I would recommend this to everyone.
B0016KV73W This is really great and we have gotten lots of use from it! We have used it as a potty seat over toilet and it can also be used to keep in your car in case your child needs to use the potty. This is a great all in one potty seat and we really love it!
B0016KV73W I take this chair everywhere with me! It fits sturdily on every type of toilet seat I have tried it on. It has little rubber strips on the underside of the legs/seat support that hold it in place. It folds up small enough to fit in a side pocket of my diaper bag or a large purse. When my son uses it it puts him in the right position to entirely miss peeing on the seat (mothers of boys know this is important). My only complaint is that the splash guard in front is kinda wide. To allow him to sit comfortably I have to take one leg out of his pants and underwear, which also involves taking off a shoe. I don't mind this so much since he just turned two and is peeing in public places thanks to this potty but might be a bigger deal to other people. I have never used it as a stand alone chair but I know that the legs must be positioned to point down and then clipped into place to be sturdy. I have tried that part and found it to be very sturdy.
B0016KV73W This may be the best baby product I've bought. My daughter was recently potty trained when we had to go on a very long road trip through rural Oregon. We were very concerned that she would regress and bought this potty out of desperation. It worked wonderfully! The legs are very sturdy when locked in place and work well on uneven ground. The bags are super and we have not experienced a single leak. We've used the &#34;mergnancy potty&#34; everywhere from the back of the SUV to the park to the beach to the side of an interstate highway. It's compact enough to fit in my big purse, so it goes everywhere with us.
B0016KV73W A travel potty is an absolute must for potty training, especially in the early days.  It is literally the difference between a breakthrough success and yet another accident.  This travel potty is exactly what we need.  It's lightweight enough to fit in the diaper bag.  When the legs are snapped into place (which took me a few tries to get right), it is extremely sturdy.  My daughter feels very secure sitting on it - it's not wobbly at all.  It's a very smart design to allow it to be placed over a public toilet too, although we mainly use it as a stand-alone potty.  I keep a bag already loaded on so that it's ready to go at a moment's notice.  We have used it everywhere:  in the front seat, back seat, trunk, on the side of the road, in the park, everywhere.  The absorbent inserts in the bags are brilliant.  The bags contain messes perfectly; we've never had a mishap.  This potty seat affords us a LOT of confidence that even if the urge sneaks up on my daughter, we will still be okay.  Every potty training family needs one of these.
B0016KV73W We are loving this potty seat for our 19 month old. He is usually slow to warm up to new things, but took to this potty seat right away and has been going potty in public restrooms with no problems now. It fits conveniently in the diaper bag. Haven't used as a stand-alone potty seat yet, but can see that double duty can come in handy too. I like this item way better than my sister's quad fold dora the explorer seat for her daughter - that one is very flimsy and I think my son is comfortable on this seat b/c even though it is small and portable it is sturdier. Great buy for ten bucks!
B0016KV73W With the reusable liner we have been able to use the 2-in-1 potette plus at home, in the car, and while traveling.  Great product.
B0016KV73W Love it! Easy to transport, fits in a backpack or handbag. So convenient for potty training on the go. Came in very handy when we went camping.
B0016KV73W So happy with this purchase - and I was sceptical.  1-Because it good TOO many good reviews; and 2-My 2 1/2 year old newly potty trained daughter can be a little particular and dramatic about new things. But I was wrong and made a great choice in my purchase.  It even fits in my tote bag.  It comes with 3 pee bags and a plastic storage bag.  The extra bags and silicone seat insert/liner are separate, but well worth the extra purchase.  The potty does sit very low to the ground, and having a tall child made me think maybe she wouldn't like the way that felt but she is fine sitting low, even though her house potty's are higher.  We use the liner/insert at houses we visit because I can easily dump it and wipe; as well as the bags for in the car or at stores so I can just toss.  I prefer to use the Potette brand bags instead of using a garbage bag with paper towels as some suggested - you never know when there is a small leak.  The bags are easy to use and have little turtles in the bottom pad which make it fun for the child to tinkle on.  The pad is genius - nothing sloshes around!  Although when I have used the silicone insert in the car, I just put paper towels in the bottom and that works just as well. My only, very small, con is manuevering the legs/handles of the pot.  It is not easy.  You have to push each end of each leg/handle all the way in to click, to make it a sturdy sit-on-the-floor potty.  Then they snap out again to fold in to store, or to flip outward to use as a toilet seat.  Our babysitter has issues with this aspect so she actually pulls each handle all the way off, and folds them in and THEN snaps them in to store it. Otherwise she can't go from the locked to the fold position.  Even I have trouble.  But the more you use it the easier it is and it works so well otherwise I will deal with that.  This really is one of the best purchases I've made as a mom so far, it makes running errands with a toddler who doesn't like big toilets so much easier!
B0016KV73W Got this just for its dual purpose of being able to use on a regular toilet and on the go.  It is nice that it is small and portable but it is really tiny when you get it on a toilet.  It looks more ring like than seat like.  This is especially true if you have an elongated toilet bowl.  And if you have an elongated bowl the seat actually ends up sitting towards the back making it a little hard for the kid to climb on to.  The worst part for boys is that if you/they are not careful the design tends to allow \"sprayage\" all over the place as there isn't much room between the kids \"junk\" and the front of the bowl.  Have the Bjorn seat in another bathroom that works really well.  Will likely get another for home and keep this one in the care for outings only.
B0016KV73W I got two of these bc we were traveling and boy they were so uncomfortable.  After every time my toddler used it, you can see red marks on both sides of his thighs.We've only used it on top of the regular toilet seat, hadn't try it the other way like we were in the woods or something.
B0016KV73W We are not a fan of this product.  I have the Baby Bjorn ones inside the house which my son loves but he refuses to use this one when we are out and about.  The first time he sat on it it wasn't correctly locked in place and the potty gave way and he fell down.  He's been traumatized every since and now I just bring the Bjorn one along for the ride in the trunk and wasted all of my money on this.
B0016KV73W Great if you travel with a kid in potty training period. It is small enough to be carried around. It can fit even in a larger purse. It is very stable once it is locked in the position. The only problem is unlocking it. I end up with the handles in my hand every time I try to unlock it and I have to put the handles back. I do not know how long the plastic is going to resist to this maneuver.
B0016KV73W This is a great small size and fits comfortably in my bag. I love using this when we are out in public. It folds out nicely where my 2-1/2 year old can hold on to it's handles and not the icky public toilet seat. I love how it folds up very small.  Great product
B0016KV73W This has saved us on road trips on the side of the road and on icky public toilets while out running errands.  Holds up well and I pretty much don't leave the house without it.
B0016KV73W This is a great seat to keep in car for going public places, but not small enough to fit in my purse or anything. It is extremely low to the ground when used as a stand-alone potty, so not very useful for that. Will do in a pinch, but my daughter is 3 and already about to outgrown ability to use it on ground.
B0016KV73W Where do I start? I love love love this toilet seat. During my search for a portable potty for my daughter I looked at many different brands and options. But after reading many reviews for this I decided to give it a try even though I worried that it might be bigger than I wanted. When it arrived I knew then its the perfect size. It is such a life saver in many ways. It helped my baby girl toilet train because the kiddie ones with a bucket that you have to throw out is just a bit too gross for me. I do not leave the house without it. I thank god every time we are out and my daughter needs to go but we're at a super disgusting public toilet. I grab a bunch of the seat covers, layer them up and slap this on top and she's ready to go. We've used it in my car too for times that a public toilet is not around which is such a life saver. This way I'm not driving 100 mph looking for the next restroom stop and panicking that she might go in her pants. It is very sturdy and easy to clean. I would buy this again in a heartbeat.
B0016KV73W My daughter likes her little \"red potty\".  I keep it in the car for emergencies and when she was toilet training I put it in the stroller for walks too.  I like that the legs can fold flat for storage, and that they click into place to sit.  (It might seem obvious if you know it already, but wasn't obvious to grandma who borrowed it while babysitting.)  The bags are great and perfectly sized to smoothly cover the seat for no mess--expensive, but we don't use them that often.  I've also just set the seat out over grass/dirt and used it sans bag (what can I say, I'm cheap like that).  I've tried a grocery bag, but they are so crinkly and slippery, and the ink flakes off...so I prefer the bag made by Potette.  I like that it has bags b/c clean up is SO EASY!!!  I don't have to rinse out a little potty or find somewhere to rinse it or toss the TP/wipe.  That is by far the biggest plus!  Especially since my 2 yr old likes \"privacy\" so she likes it in the back of the SUV rather than on the ground in the parking lot.  It does sit very low to the ground, so it might be less comfortable for bigger toddlers, but that's a sacrifice for convenience and portability.
B0016KV73W During potty training this has been fantastic.  My daughter learned to potty train in a potty chair, but that meant pleading with her to pee before we left the house, and rushing home before the next &#34;potty.&#34;  Once we got this, it was easy to throw in my (large) purse and off we'd go.  She felt much more secure on large public toilets.  Not only that, you have the capability to turn this into an emergency potty chair by folding the legs down instead of out to the side.  It's great for long car trips because we don't have to race to the next exit to find a gas station.  We're able to put this in the hatchback trunk and just let her go there, in the provided liners (you could also use a plastic shopping bag -without holes!).This is great to even just leave in the trunk.
B0016KV73W I really like this product. I was a bit unsure of it at first because it looked so small. But we have used it in the public restrooms and at people's houses and it works great over a toilet. The arms fold out and click into place creating a sturdy seat. The arms also click into place creating a stool like seat for using without a toilet. We have not had the opportunity to try that out yet. As a travel potty it does fit well into a diaper bad. Surprisingly compact.
B0016KV73W This thing is awesome!  We keep it in the back of the car at all times.  My daughter is very afraid of &#34;big potties&#34; and this is our solution.  We buy the refill bags and it's so convenient.  I originally bought it for use on a trip and even brought it on the airplane. We still use it now.  On outings I just ask her if she needs to go (usually while exiting or entering the car) and I open up the back hatch of my car, she hops in and goes.  I keep a little pack of diaper wipes in the bag with it.  Then before walking into a store (or the park) I just tie up the bag and toss it in the garbage on my way in.  Nothing to clean up and I don't have to hunch over a public bathroom telling my daughter over and over to stop touching everything.  Sometimes we'll bring it to parks near us that don't have bathrooms.  We've been using this for about 10 months now and are only on our second pack of refill packs.  Totally worth it.
B0016KV73W Yes, its not the biggest place for a bottom to rest BUT proof is in the usage:My 3 year old didn't miss a beat (or the seat) the first time she used it. We keep it in the back of the car ready to go and she just hops on there when needed.  Its little legs were a little difficult to lock into place (and in-lock) the first couple of times but after that it was a cinch.  Once in place it is very stable.  They bags hold everythign well and its easy to get set up and packed away for next time.  Ideal for travel or a trip to the park when the porta potties are a little more aromatic than desired.
B0016KV73W We used this twice. It seriously was much easier to just hold my daughter over a public potty and wash our hands thoroughly than bring this in and take it with us. It's small, yes but it just wasn't fun to lug something else in and out of restaurants, the mall, etc. Plus I felt like we were just carrying germs around with us from one potty to another. It's sort of an unnecessary purchase unless you are using it for camping, the beach, etc. For public potties just use the potty.
B0016KV73W Only use this is a  toilet seat converter for my kiddos.  For this it works well and is nice & compact.  I have a Ju Ju Be Backpack and it fits inside the back zippered change mat section (after taking out the mat which I no longer need) Don't like it as a sit on potty though.  My daughter won't use it as I think it feels unstable to her.  I keep a Cool Gear Travel Potty  in the car for her to use if we can't find a toilet as it's sets up as a sturdy bench seat, it's also higher off the ground than this potette.  Works with the potette bags (or any plastic bag for that matter) so it's a fast disposal just like the pottette.
B0016KV73W Lifesaver for a potty-training 3 year old who is still mostly resistant. This removes the fear of &#34;falling&#34; into the toilet plus the handles keep his tiny hands away from the germ infested seat.  Works great with the Potty Cover or Potty Topper (provides added layer of protection / barrier).  The portability is also a plus. This is a MUST-HAVE for potty training parents.
B0016KV73W We've owned this for a few weeks now and it's simply THE BEST! Every parent with little ones potty training should get one of these! Our girl has used this potty-style in the back of our SUV, in the backseat of our sedan, on the side of the road, at the neighborhood pool, and seated-style on numerous public restrooms. I purchased the disposable bags with these and once I ran out, found a grocery store bag and 2 papertowels folded over works just as well and is more convenient and cheaper than the bags. This potty is comfortable for my girl, easy to transport (comes with a carrying bag), easy to use, easy to clean, convenient, inexpensive and has been invaluable for keeping in the car and using when the moment strikes! Great product! I might consider this my new go-to gift for new parents...even though they'd have to wait a few years until they can use it...it's that wonderful.
B0016KV73W Works great as a portable potty option.  My son is terrified of large public toilets and this makes him feel safe without me having to lug something large around.  The bag is great for keeping it thrown in my diaper bag.  The front is a little lower than his other one which has led to some unintentional spraying!  I have yet to try it as a travel potty.
B0016KV73W Our son hated kiddie potties.  He just went straight from diapers to the regular toilet.  I'm sure it would come in handy if you camped a lot, or traveled a lot, but it just didn't work for us.
B0016KV73W This potty seat is great! We use it daily in my son's bathroom at home, and it folds easily to take with us out of the house. It has fit every toilet seat we've put it on, with no problems. No touching germy public toilets! I can't say anything about using it as a portable potty since we've never tried it that way. But it was a great purchase, worth every penny!
B0016KV73W I bought this more to use on public toilets, and the ocassional stand along use.  My son isn't comfortable using it on the big toilet AT ALL.  I don't like that it sits on the very back of the toilet.  When his pants are pulled to the ankles, his legs then have to sit out straight, making sitting very awkward.  And I also can't tell whether he is 'pointed down' because his legs are in the way of me seeing.Perhaps this would be better to use in the back of a minivan or something during a long trip.  But I don't have a huge car, and I don't find it very useful for everyday shopping, errands, etc.
B0016KV73W Simply one of the best baby / kid products around. Folds and unfolds easily and works great as a stand-alone potty or an adaptor for a regular toilet. Lightweight and inexpensive, too.
B0016KV73W This is the perfect little potty for our uses: emergencies and on long car trips. I love that it can be used as a seat on a big potty, if you have that option, or on it's own with the bags. I have bought the liners that this company makes to go along with this potty because I like the ease of knowing there won't be spills or leaks if I were to use my own. I also like the ease of not having to carry around both grocery bags and something to put in the bottom of them (although that's a great idea in case I ever find myself without one of Kalencom's liner bags!).We are using this as an emergency potty for our kids ages 9, 6, and 2, although the 9 and 6 year old are able to hold it until we find an actual bathroom better than the 2 year old.
B0016KV73W After a week of potty training at home I knew I had to venture out and have my son sit on a public toilet. The potette fits perfectly on all the public toilets I've tried it on but it does require some getting used to. My son just turned 2 and is small for his age but he fits fine on it but it took a few tries to get him seated properly so he doesn't pee all over the place. I thought I would use the seat as a travel potty for the car as well but I tried sitting my son on it as a toilet and he fell right through to the floor. Since he has been trained on a real toilet with a potty seat he just wasn't used to sitting so low to the ground with nothing to hold on to.While it has been a life saver in public places, it is a pain in the butt to carry around. We rarely use a stroller so it's not an option to throw it in the basket underneath. And I was trying to get away from using a diaper bag anymore since my son is now potty trained. But this potty is just too large to fit in any purse that I own. So it's back to carrying a diaper bag for now and hopefully I can teach my son to pee standing up soon :)
B0016KV73W Pros:-has a raised upper lip so i'm not as scared of my boy peeing all over the place-sturdy ring that does not fold, so no worries about it caving or breaking or pinching-can work both as a potty seat or stand alone potty. we haven't tried the latter feature yet, but basically there are 2 folding legs on each side that fold in when not in use; fold out all the way like wings so that you can place on a toilet seat; & can fold legs 90 degrees to the potty seat itself so that it can be standingCons:-on the smaller side, but works fine for my little guy, who is on the smaller side**It's inevitable that whatever potty set you get, the yucky public toilet will be exposed to your child. So, our system is to bring a travel pack of sanitizing wipes and wipe the toilet seat and anything icky and tempting for toddler to touch (like flusher, sanitary napkin box, etc) and then place potty seat on top. Works great!
B0016KV73W It works as intended. We keep it in the car for our daughter and it can be used in public restrooms. There has been a few emergencies while she's been in the car seat. It's easy to pull over to a private spot, set up the Potette, and let her go. It's definately saved us from car accidents. Some people have complained that the legs fly out from under the seat. I have not found this to be an issue at all. The instructions show that when the legs are pulled out they need to be pushed up to \"click\" into the seat. It's solid when pushed into that position.EDIT: 12/2012 -- We still have this in our car. It's been a long time and still have the original one. It works great. No issues at all. Awesome when you are miles from a toilet and the little one says, \"I gotta go!\"
B0016KV73W This thing is awesome!!! it is great for road side emergency potty breaks, fitting onto the toilets when we're out and about, also for at home when my daughter was potty training. I appreciate that it comes in it's own carrying bag so I don't have to store it in one of my own bags. Easy to clean and the bags that it is sold with are perfect.
B0016KV73W Maybe this will be more useful in traveling when my daughter gets older, but it's not working for a toilet topper. It slides around too much and doesn't stay where it needs to stay. Also, it's so thin, it's not very comfortable for my daughter. I really liked the idea of this product though. I hope we can use it in the future.
B0016KV73W I love this one.  I looked at A LOT of portable potty seats when we got ready for potty training, and all of them seemed either too flimsy or too big.  This is the sturdy and relatively portable (depending on the size of your diaper bag).  I love that it can be used with the bags as a true travel potty as well as just a portable potty seat.
B0016KV73W I purchased this potty to prepare for the next step in potty learning, attempting to go outside sans diaper.We aren't there yet but boy howdy what a multi-functioning potty.During potty learning, I know some folks like to have a mobile potty available in every room for their child.  I wasn't keen on this idea.  Nor was my daughter.  When I took her potty out to clean the bathroom floor, she told me that her potty belongs in the potty next to Mommy and Daddy's potty.  We nixed the idea of moving the potty.Then one evening while she was getting ready for bed and giving the 10th excuse to get out of bed, she stated, \"I need to go potty.\"  I didn't want to stop her if she really needed to and felt telling her to go in her overnight would probably be confusing to her.  I also didn't want her to leave the bedroom.I quickly remembered the portable potty!  I grabbed it and opened it up and told her this was her special to go potty.  She loved it and now we keep it in the bedroom for when she has to go during bedtime.The size is just right for us.  It's not too big or small and is compact enough that we can slip it into our travel bag for trips to see family and friends.I love the bags that come with it.  They seem flimsy but do the job well.  Each bag has this square liner that helps absorb liquid.  It's not as absorbent as a diaper but it does the job.  You wipe, drop the wipes in the bag and just take the handles off the sides and tie it up and trash.  The bags have a light but pleasant scent that isn't too overpowering.The portable potty plus also gives you the option to make it a seat on top of a standard toilet.  I haven't tried this option yet but it seems sturdy enough.  Parts are made of rubber that seem to help with stability and no slip.A few tips that I culled from reading the manual and speaking to other parents:1.  If you open it up to be a portable potty, make sure to snap the legs closed so it doesn't collapse on your child.  The easiest way to do this is flip the legs down and put the potty on the ground.  Put your hands on top of the potty seat and apply pressure until you hear the clicking sound.2.  If you use it as a seat over the toilet, make sure the handle bars are also locked so your child's fingers don't get caught in between the seat and the toilet seat.3.  If you use it as a portable potty, you can leave a maximum of three bags on it.  This saves you from having to re-line it every time and the occasional, 'I'm not done yet!' and plop back onto the seat after you pulled the dirty bag off move.This potty is not for the very young or for those that cannot sit upright for long periods of time.  It is a portable potty so it only has the seat and does not provide any back support.  I only state this as some folks have early potty learners.  We started potty learning early, mainly so that Mommy didn't have to use the bathroom with a baby on her lap.  Because of such, we also have a backed Bjorn potty in the bathroom.  We started using the Bjorn at age 15 months as a chair.  We started using the portable potty at age 2.Hope this helps.
B0016KV73W I was so excited to try this little potty for an upcoming trip!  The only problem is that our little one doesn't like it.  She is a very petite (21 pounds, 32 inches) 19 month old and the ring is too big for her.  She looks very uncomfortable on it like she feels she is going to fall through.  It also sits too low to the ground for her.  We will keep it around and hope that maybe she will grow into it and it will be a our \"go-to\" travel potty.  But for now we will search for something else.
B0016KV73W This is okay.  I thought it would look a little more like a toilet, but it's working for my husband's half attempts at &#34;elimination communication.&#34;  He hates diaper changes and saw this as a way of training a four-month old to pee in a toilet.  I think it will likely be helpful when we really take on toilet training--especially for trips.
B0016KV73W This is a great little travel potty and we have also used it as a portable toilet seat for public restrooms.There are a couple of things that could improve it though.  The legs are so short that even a 34 inch child does not look comfortable sitting on it.  Also, do not allow children to fold the chair back together.  It is easy to pinch your fingers if you are not careful.The Kalencom PLUS works as a toilet seat too for public restrooms and it does the job.  However, I do not like this seat as a portable toilet seat for three reasons. With boys the pee can hit the wrong spot and splatter; the seat is lumpy; and it slips a bit on the toilet.  This product is best used as just a travel potty and it is good for that.  It is nice you can put three of the disposable bags on it in advance and be ready for emergency potty stops.
B0016KV73W This is GREAT for our newly potty training son. Fits great on a regular toilet lid for out and about, and easy to use for stand alone times (saved us at the beach from having to stand in a long line for the restroom for him). I love it and can't say enough great things about it. My only wish (and this is being super nit picky) is that the splash gaurd would be bigger (for boys). But that is just being super pic
B0016KV73W I love this thing. It was well worth the money spent. We use it all the time. It will adjust to fit any toilet and my daughter feels safe and secure using it. I hate using public restrooms, but this thing makes the whole process a little more palatable. I leave it in my car in a small bag (along with a little container of antibacterial wipes) and it goes into the stroller when we are the zoo, mall, church, etc. One of my favorite features---and one that you definitely can't tell from the image shown---is that when it is folded out, there are little handles for the kid to hold onto. My daughter loves that and I love it that she isn't gripping a public toilet. We haven't had to use it in the &#34;stand-alone&#34; position yet. Circumstances just haven't required it. But someone said that you can make your own bags for it by cuttting a sanitary pad in half, sticking it in a plastic grocery sack. The pad absorbs liquid and you just tie it up and toss. Sounds fine to me. I have a couple in my car in a little pouch for the time when that happens. Very happy with this purchase.
B0016KV73W I got this for my 2 year old who we'd just potty trained. I didn't want to get caught short in the car away from the bathroom, but I also didn't want a great big potty in the trunk of the car. This is great, it folds small. To use it as a travel potty, you click the legs, add the bag and away they pee (you can buy 'special bags' but a diaper bag with a bit of paper towel in the bottom would work as well.) I read some reviews that it collapses when the kids are on it, but if you click the legs in properly, it does not.To use on the toilet just extend the legs like the wings on a airplane, pop it on the seat and them on top.It folds small enough for the diaper bag too!
B0016KV73W I can't explain how impressed and happy i am with this product. I bought it for my 2 year old for a camping trip but we had an emergency and we travelled in the philippines. It made our life a lot easier because we don't have to rush and stop somewhere when my daughter needs to potty. We used it when we are out and i don't feel comfortable about my daughter using the public toilets and we even use it inside the car ( i just sit her in the back) .. This product was worth every penny, i highly recommend it if you travel a lot and good for those who are starting potty training
B0016KV73W I bought this product for my twin girls who are almost 2 and a half and we've been using it for almost 2 months now. It's the best travel potty ever! Folds very easily and can fit in a medium-sized bag. Super easy to use. Nice color. We tried another potty before this one and one of my little girls kept saying &#34;it hurts, mommy&#34;. We never had such a problem with this potty. We've traveled with it the whole summer and it's been a lifesaver on so many occasions! I can't imagine traveling without it! I do think that the liners are overpriced but that's not too big an issue -- You can always use this potty with other small plastic bags. Highly recommended.
B0016KV73W My two year old just started potty training and I knew we would need something we could use when we are out of the house. I love that it can be used as a stand alone potty or as a seat on a regular toilet. This potty usually gets used as a stand alone with the bag inserts, which I really like and are biodegradable. We haven't used it for long so I don't know how durable it will be but it does seem to be pretty good quality plastic and will hopefully last through two kids. It's sturdy when the legs are locked in place and pretty small when folded down. Our toddler seems to feel secure on it as it gets used frequently. I'm really glad we bought this and for the price you can't beat it.
B0016KV73W Bought for traveling with twin 2-year-olds.  When placed on a regular toilet, this seat bends a bit at the seams when the kids sit on it.  This makes them feel unsteady.  They rejected it completely at first.  On a second trip, they were a bit more willing to try, but still not as comfortable as the Bjorn seats we use at home.  Very small when in the stand-alone position.  Might work better once they're actually potty trained instead of just starting.
B0016KV73W We kept this in the back of the car and used it several times.  It works great, and is so easy to clean up.  Love it!
B0016KV73W This potty is great for my two year-old.  It's a potty seat when the legs are folded out and a travel potty when the legs are down (and a baggie is inserted).  As a potty seat, I like that it creates a barrier between my daughter and that toilet seat gap most public toilets have.  It's also stable enough (on most toilets) for me to stand back and let her go on her own (per her request) without slipping or sliding about.  We've also had to use it three times as an emergency travel potty and it's been great.  My only complaint is that my daughter likes going on it so much that one of those frantic stops was a total fake; she just wanted sit on it.It fits in my diaper bag and doesn't add that much bulk or weight.  Although it's always with me, I find that I only use it as a potty seat now when the toilet is particularly icky.One last thing -- it comes in a travel bag that is just a thick, white plastic bag with a drawstring top.
B0016KV73W We use this potty often, and although the seat is small it seems to serve its purpose. My son adapted to it easily and never had any issues. My only complaint is buying the bags. They can be costly when you use it as often as we do. And any new child learning to potty train will need to go before entering the store, and when coming out of the store! I also only have 1 store nearby that carries these bags, and once there shelves are empty I am out of luck until they get more in. I have used a shopping bag in a pinch, but be forwarned they are not usually leak proof. I have also used small garbage bags with a maxi pad which served its purpose but can also be a disaster as the bag would stick to my sons bottom as he would stand, and also while out in public it looked ridiculas. Wish they made some type of adapter or someway to use diaper diaposal bags as this would be more cost effective and easier. 
B0016KV73W I was so excited to find this potty. It was exactly what we needed for being on the go, as my son doesn't like to use toilets yet. The major drawback though is that when my son goes pee, the pee goes everywhere since there isn't an effective splash guard. Otherwise, this is great for #2. We haven't yet tried it over the big toilet since my son prefers a potty and is a bit fearful of toilets, even with this over the seat.
B0016KV73W We have loved this potty - it's easily portable and works great at home too.  It's our all around potty for our 2 1/2 yr old.  Some reviewers said the seat was small - we haven't found that to be the case but he does seem less comfortable on it than he is on his little potty that has a foam/rubber ring for comfort (he squirms a little on this seat).  However, now that he's not sitting on the potty just waiting to go, he does just fine on this seat for the length of time it takes him to potty.  I would have given this 5 starts if it seemed a little more comfortable for him.  
B0016KV73W Haven't used it a lot yet but so far this is great.  Has been sturdy and comfortable on toilet.  Haven't used it alone but when snapped in properly seems it will be fine.  Bought another to keep in each car.
B0016KV73W I keep this in the back of my car for those emergency situations where my little one can't get to a potty. So handy to have this! It has saved me several times.
B0016KV73W I have one in each of our cars and one in the stroller. Our nanny hates going to public restroom in the part because a lot of homeless people go there so she will use the potette every day letting our daughter do her business in the park. The bags are a bit expensive but grocery bags so often have holes I'd rather be safe than sorry. I have also used it in restaurants when they have no seat liner and I still put some toilet paper on the toilet seat towards the front that the potette doesn't cover. Many times we have pulled over or exit freeway to find a parking lot where my daughter can go potty. One times she did it inside our car but she bent her leg too high and the pee kinda squirt out of the potette so I make sure she straighten her legs when she as to pee. Overall it is a great product. You do have to make sure the legs snap in place when using as a chair. IMO, even if I only use it once it is totally worth the money so my daughter doesn't have to touch any dirty toilet seat or when she needs to go while we are driving somewhere.
B0016KV73W We do not go anywhere without the potette in our car!  We have been using the same one for about 2 years now and it is fantastic.  It is small enough to fit in your diaper bag (really, smaller and lighter than you would think) and incredibly sturdy.  Those who commented that it is not sturdy are not properly snapping it into place.  I had this problem initially, but once I got the hang of it, it is sturdy enough for even a very desperate adult ;)  We usually don't bother with the bags - we just find a nice patch of grass on the side of the road (we live in the country) and let the pee hit the grass - works like a charm!
B0016KV73W Caution for boys - the splash guard is a little too short to stop spray from coming out under splash guard and back up onto their pants when used on an adult toilet, and if bag liner isn't on just right - and definitely if you try without any liner.  The reusable liner has saved us lots of trouble and made this a good park/travel potty.  Second Caution is that you have to really make sure to click the legs into place just right or it collapses and pinches small fingers when set up as stand-alone travel potty.  Even after reading directions and thinking I was doing it correctly, it took a friend with the same potty to show me how to really get the legs all the way clicked into place before we stopped having trouble.  We now love it for taking out and about as a small potty.
B0016KV73W I keep this thing in my car, and make sure I take it on every trip. Because as you know, as soon as you leave the gas station....somebody has to go potty right there and then!!! I like that the legs fold, it doesn't take up space! and then you tie the bags and you throw them away! Super clean!
B0016KV73W fantastic product! I recently brought it along to our 2 week trip to China. It was so handy I cant say enough good things about it! Product works perfectly and so convenient. In the hotel room it works perfectly as the toilet seat. When we were out, I have had to use the bag a couple of times when my son had to poo and pee. Toilets were hard to find, CLEAN toilets were very rare, so needless to say, it was a lifesaver! It was however kind of short for my 4 year old son. Even when set up, it was quite short and he was a little uncomfortable but he just had to do his thing and he was off. Still a 5 star for me. If they would make it a little more comfy for the little one would be amazing. Highly recommended for parents with toilet going kids!
B0016KV73W This is a great seat to use with the liners and to have in your car. But when put on a toilet it is a very large opening and no splash guard and not very comfortable. Since the opening is wide, it was difficult for my 2year old to sit for any long period of time. We took it on our vacation but probably won't be doing that again. It's going to live in my car and used for roadtrips and emergencies. On vacation I'd still take another more comfy seat that will stay in the hotel or the fold up kind to use in my diaper bag. The liners are great tho!! Nothing else out there like this seat plus liners.
B0016KV73W I wanted to love this potty. I read all of the reviews and was so impressed by how many people raved about it. I think it would work great for a young two year old. However, I bought this when my son had just turned three. My son is very slim at only 50th percentile for weight yet he complains that the potty is too small and uncomfortable to use. He also complains that it is too low to the ground and he feels like he will fall off of it. So, this travel potty is going in storage until my daughter turns two, when I will try it out on her.I do like the design of the potty. It is very compact and folds up nicely to fit in a diaper bag for easy travel. I did find the legs to be a bit tricky to get to pop out (to set up the seat for use) and back in (for storage). I havent used the potty that much though so maybe with increased use I will get better at popping the legs of the potty in and out.I also have to pass on a trick that has worked well for us when we are away from a toilet with my 3 year old son. If you take a large sized zip loc bag and let him pee in there it works rather well. You just seal it up or pour it out and dispose of it. Obviously, this only works well 1) for a boy and 2) for peeing only.So, in sum, because it is so small and low to the ground be mindful of this if you are buying it for a 3 year old or for a larger sized two year old. And even if your child fits on the seat, if they are used to sitting higher up on other potty chairs, such as the bjorn potty, they may feel awkward or like they are going to fall off when they sit on this low to the ground seat and they may refuse to use it. From my experience with this travel potty thus far, I probably wouldn't buy it again, but since I have it I am going to hang onto it and give it another try when my daughter turns two.
B0016KV73W This was a lifesaver at the beach while my daughter was potty training. I highly recommend it. Works great on its own or as a potty seat on an adult toilet. Great purchase.
B0016KV73W Potty training is not an easy process. This 2 in 1 potty/seat helps a lot with the process. I take it everywhere with me. I mostly use it as a seat but there were a few times where I used it as a potty and it worked perfect (During a picnic, in the car once when parked..)The bags are expensive but I bought them anyway. You never know when you will need them. It's been a year and I still plenty of them left just because I use this product as a seat more often then a potty (As a potty in emergencies or places with no restrooms or with really filthy ones!!)Great buy :))
B0016KV73W My 3 year old is very afraid of going to a loud public bathroom. This has come in handy every time we go out. I do t buy the bags and found if I just use a plastic bag (like target thick bags) with some paper towels it works perfectly. I highly recommend this to everyone with a toddler
B0016KV73W We keep one of these in the back of our SUV.  It's a perfect solution to when you LO needs to go and you don't have a toilet to use or for potty training.  It's small enough to fit in a diaper bag, pool bag, beach bag.  Goes everywhere with us!  And the liners are a must have.  They make it super clean and easy!
B0016KV73W we are about a week into potty training and so far this is my son's preferred potty seat.  we also have a little frog potty and a seat that sits on a regular toilet, but I guess this is the one he finds most comfortable.  I bought the reusable liner and I definitely recommend it if you plan on using this seat as more than just a travel toilet.Cons: I haven't tried using this as a travel option yet.  It seems like it would be kind of difficult at first, as it takes a minute to set up, too long for a newly trained child in my opinion.  I'm not thrilled with it as a seat on a regular toilet.  My son kind of sinks into it and the hard plastic leaves red marks.  Also, it doesn't work with a potty hook and we only have one small bathroom so I need something that saves space.Overall, if my son likes it then it's a winner and I like that it has three functions.btw grocery store plastic bags work well too
B0016KV73W This portable toilet is GREAT!! It is easy to set up, thoguh I never use it on adult public toilets, it feels gross. I can set it up in any corner, even at the mall and no one knows. The bags are biodegradable which is also great. They have absorbent pads in them to hold the pee too. It is small and has a bag to carry. Really a must for any one with small kids!
B0016KV73W Legs wont click into place and keeps falling down when my little 25lb daughter sits on it. It squeezed her fingers as it fell down and now my daughter refuses to use it. Its a great idea but if the legs don't stay in place and falls, its useless. This is going right back to amazon. I am disappointed as I really think its a good concept. Hopefully I just got a lemon.
B0016KV73W We keep this in the bottom of the stroller and it has saved us many times.Early on in potty training, it came in quite handy when our toddler had the sudden need to go to the bathroom and there was no restroom.  This quickly opens and solves that problem.We also use it often on public toilets.  Not only is it more hygienic, but also much less scary for our toddler than using some strange new toilet in a strange public restroom.It is a bit frustrating to pay for the extra bags.  They look just like plastic shopping bags with a swatch of paper towel inside.  However, the difference is that these bags never have any holes.  When you are carrying a bag full of urine to the trash can, you'll be happy it is the Kalencom bag that never leaks.
B0016KV73W This portable potty is wonderful -- it fits on every toilet we've tried (very old, small, round toilets can be a bit of an issue, but then you can fit it on the bowl instead of on the seat and it still works just fine), and it works as a portable stand-alone potty as well. It folds up small enough that it isn't annoying to bring it everywhere -- even on airplanes -- and is very sturdy!And with the high weight limit (96lbs), I have no worries about my son (30lbs at 22mos) outgrowing the seat before he's done potty-training.
B0016KV73W My toddler trained early (22 months) and is a little on the short side. Doing our business while we're out and about has been challenging because pulic toilets are so big. AND, I think not having an option for I'm while we're out was sending him mixed messages. I bought this today and we stopped for lunch- he announced he needed to go and he used it right away- no hesitation. In fact, he was even excited because it was just his size. It's small enough to fit in my bag and I'm going to carry it everywhere. I'm not sure how it will be for bigger kids but for my dude it was perfect.
B0016KV73W We always tell my son to &#34;point down&#34; when he pees, but it still will spray out of this. There is a gap between the set cover and the actual seat so I wish it would go down further to prevent sprays. Overall it is a decent product and good for quick trips to the potty, and taking in public.
B0016KV73W My son is on the small side for a twenty month old boy.  I purchased this product after I realized that he would not use the big potty at his sister's swim practice, and he was refusing to wear anything but his big boy pants... They sell this product at a major toy store for very little money so I bought it there.  For putting it on a big potty it works WONDERFUL.  No issues there at all.  The size is great for carrying with you, and the bag that comes with it is a nice touch.  My only issue is that when I set it up as a stand alone potty and my son promplty sat down on it, it collapsed.  I tried it again, same thing (much more reluctant child though).  I was not able to get it to click into place, which is apparently the problem... I do think its worth the money though, especially if you get one that will click into place.  Sure its small, but this is for babies as young as 15 months.. bigger toddlers/pre schoolers will likely need something else.
B0016KV73W This was a potty training piece of awesomeness. Flexible for traveling, and easy for our 20 month old to sit on. During her 3 day potty training weekend we kept this handy, carrying from room to room, for &#34;pit stops.&#34; It saved our floors from a lot of extra scrubbing. I call it our porta-potty as it goes everywhere with us for potty time emergencies (we've used it by the side of the road, in a park, in the back of our SUV...) and also as her toilet ring seat in public restrooms. It folds up and fits in its own carrying bag along with a spare set of training pants and small pack of flushable wipes. That kit in turn fits in my tote bag or beneath the stroller. Regular grocery bags work fine, just make sure they don't have any little holes in them!
B0016KV73W I was skeptical about this one but, as soon as the UPS man delivered it my 2  year old boy wanted to go on it.  I let him go 1 time inside but, told him after that it was an outside only potty.  We have used it at least 6 times in 2 days and I'm mostly very pleased with it.  Setup is very easy (just make sure you hear the click when locking the legs in place) but, the built in deflector is somewhat small.  Until he learns to \"hold it down\" we are going to have to take off his pants and training pants so his legs sit wide enough that \"it\" points down automatically (you Mothers of boys know what I'm talking about).  Also unlocking/folding the legs was a little hard the first couple of times but, it seams to get easier every time.  I looked at a couple different portable potty chairs before deciding on this one.  The other 2 options were both bulky and 1 didn't have a deflector and the other sealed so you had to carry the \"waste\" home and clean it out.  Overall, I am very pleased with this seat.
B0016KV73W This is the best $10 I have ever spent!One week after my son turned 2, he decided that he was going to use the toilet and no more diapers.  While I applauded his desire and determination, I had a feeling the &#34;ability&#34; might take a bit of time to perfect.  So, after seeing the &#34;special potties for using on the go&#34; in one of his potty books, I took to Amazon to find out what these on the go potties are.  For $10, I decided to try the potette plus--and have now purchased 3 potette plus-es!These things are A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! They are little folding 'potties' that can be set up as a small potty OR (bonus!) placed upon a full sized adult toilet seat to make it child sized.  The legs easily snap into place to set the potette up as a potty and easily extend out to use as a child's seat on the adult toilet.  It is the PERFECT size for the &#34;mommy, I have to potty&#34;, as soon as you make your turn onto a busy street--you can easily pull off into the closest parking lot or parking space, set up the potty on the car seat, floor, hatchback, folded down seat, what have you, so that junior can make his pee pee, after telling you for the 5000th time before you left the house 1 minute earlier that he did not have to go.Pros:  Fits perfectly in the diaper bag where we used to keep the changing padEasy to set up and use; for a portable potty, stick in one of the included liners (replacements are available for a reasonable price too--they look like plastic grocery bags with an absorbent pad at the bottom), and prop up the potty for junior to use (we keep it set up in the car--we fold down the front passenger seat and let junior sit on his throne on the folded seat.  It's saved us many a time from an 'unforeseen car seat incident' as grandpa would call it.  Also perfect for bathroom-less parks, the beach, or anyplace else that your little one has to go while &#34;on the go&#34;.  Once junior does his business in the disposable liner, you remove the bag, tie up the handles, toss it in the trash and go about your day.Easy to use on the adult potty.  My little guy was public restroom (or any restroom that was not at home) a-phobic.  He REFUSED to use toilets that were not his own, which made leaving the house while potty training extra fun.  After we got the potette, every toilet seat looks alike! (because the potette is nicely propped on top and that is all the little one sees).The legs/handles keep junior from grabbing those germ infested toilet seats in public restrooms to hold on--he can just hang on to the legs/handles of the potette plus and keep his precious hands free from public toilet yucks.Cons:  We didn't realize that the legs snapped up into the potette to stabilize it when used as a potty.  We learned that after a couple of wobbly attempts.  Make sure that you snap the legs in place when using as a free standing potty.Overall, it has made potty training a breeze.  We never had to spend those long dreaded weekends at home because junior was learning to use the toilet.  We just bring the potette plus with us and he's good to go &#34;on the go&#34;.  We keep 1 in each car and 1 in the diaper bag.  It seems like nothing brings on the urge to potty like getting strapped into the car seat and pulling out of the neighborhood.
B0016KV73W I carried this potty in my purse (it barely fit) while my daughter was potty training. I hardly had to use it, but it was good to have. I carried plastic grocery bags and napkins to put at the bottom of the bag to absorb pee.Negatives:- It takes more than a few seconds to set-up, so if she really needs to go, she might not make it, and you're breaking a sweat.- She has to be okay with sitting down on plastic, because the plastic bag wraps around the seat.- The folding out and collapsing of the legs could improve in designPositives:- portable- pink- can use grocery bags and then throw away immediately
B0016KV73W This is a very good product for girls.  It's easy to use, fits well inside the toilet and my daughter has something to hold on to.
B0016KV73W This seat is perfect.  After looking at all of the travel potty seat options, I chose to buy this seat for my three-year old for our recent road trip.  It couldn't have worked better.  It has fit on every public and home toilet that we have found.  My daughter feels safe on it and really likes it.  She always asks if I have it, even if we are just going out to the park or store.  Plus, she is most comfortable holding on to it while using it, which means her hands stay away from the public potty.We have also used it once in its free-standing mode.  It worked great!  As long as you clip the legs in properly, it is very secure.  Anyone who has had problems with it collapsing must not have had it clicked in right.The only drawback is that you have to buy their bags, if you are going to use it without a toilet.  But their bags are great -- they have a pad for absorbing pee, and are super easy to attach and detach.  When we run out, I will probably try to use regular plastic bags in an attempt to save money, but will probably eventually cave into buying more of their bags because they are so easy and mess-free.  Plus, since it fits on every toilet we've found, I doubt I will use it in its free-standing mode very often.Bottom line -- WELL worth the money.  Great product.
B0016KV73W I love the idea, and while my 3 year is not opposed to using it when we are out it is SO low to the ground.  I have to help him squat down so far and it looks so uncomfortable.  He has missed it comepletely and made huge messes in the back of my car.  I wish the legs could extend somehow.  Great for smaller kids I guess.
B0016KV73W This product is amazing. It gives me piece of mind that my kids (and I!) will always have where to go. Is true that you gotta make sure that the legs of the potty SNAP securely before your child sits on it (I forgot to do this the very first time and the potty collapsed on one side), so make sure it snaps in place. I attached a picture of how the potty looks on a public toilet. It is sturdy for my 2 year old... even tho I still put some toilet paper on the toilet UNDER my potette just in case LOL. Fits my diaper bag, which is normal size... I love this thing.
B0016KV73W Just got it for my potty training daugther, who usually needs to go like now.  We now take it everywhere.  We liked the bags, but ended doing what I read in a review, which is just using regular bags with paper towel on them and it works like a charm (make sure the bag doesn't have any holes like many of them sometimes do).  It has saved us from having to put our daughter to pee under a tree, having to stop and look for a restaurant or something, and things like that.
B0016KV73W Yeah, it's a great idea.  Now, does it work?  Yes!  When it comes down to it, people are talking about two things about this seat.  ONE, there might be a issue for boys because the ring is on the small side; TWO, PUSH IN THE LEGS for the stand alone position.  My daughter wobbled over the first time; so I checked everyones' comments, and now it's great.  Bottom line, great for the occasional emergency.  We all have been there in the dirty gas station thinking we will burn EVERYTHING when we get home.  Great alternative.
B0016KV73W LOVE LOVE LOVE!! My daughter is sort of leery of new things. So I was prepared to fight for her to use this. Boy was I wrong&#8230; She wanted to replace the potty seat we have in the house with this one that I bought for the car :)It is very sturdy. My daughter is 32lbs and not sure of the stat but very tall for her ago (almost 3 years) and she uses it just fine!
B0016KV73W I love this potty seat, it's small and convenient.  My daughter does not hesitate to get up on it in a public restroom.  It fits on the toilet and does not move around, I have found this true on all shapes of toilets.  The rubber handles holds it in place.  I have not used it on the &#34;go&#34; where it stands on his own but it seems sturdy enough if it had to be used that way.  It's small enough that it fits in a small diaper bag.  The rubber handles fold up into the seat to make it smaller.
B0016KV73W After using this for a few months in my house for my 3yr 2mo old granddaughter, I put it away to use only for trips to the park, beach etc. and bought anotherArm & Hammer Secure Comfort Potty Seat, Colors May Varyfor my second bathroom that she uses. Here's why:1. The portability of this product is great for use outside the home. It folds easily and compactly. It also can be used as a standalone toilet when nothing else is available.2. So what's the problem with home use? When the legs are pushed up and locked into place, this just isn't stable on the toilet seat. My granddaughter has complained that sometimes it \"pops up\", which is absolutely true. Unless your child sits perfectly in the center of the seat when sitting down, and also gets up without shifting weight to one side, this seat will indeed pop up. That problem doesn't exist when using this as a standalone potty since the legs are facing down.Bottom line: This is a very handy item for day trips, but not something I recommend as a regular potty seat at home.Update April 28, 2014: I've been taking this along when we go out to different places to eat. It's relatively compact to bring, and since I don't let my granddaughter go into a public bathroom alone (unlike when she uses the bathroom in my house), I just hold it in place so it doesn't pop up when she uses it.
B0016KV73W We keep this potty in the car. My daughter is 2, and she loves it. You can just use a grocery bag and a paper towel, but I would double the plastic bag.
B0016KV73W This doesn't fold up as compactly as some seats, but this isn't only for placing on top of a toilet like most are. My DD absolutely REFUSES to go on public toilets, so this has been a wonderful solution for us. And, when she is finally ready for them, this will give her the comfort of being the same thing she's used to going on. It doesn't fold up very well if you have the reusable liner on it, but the disposable ones let it collapse completely as it should. However, my DD will only use the reusable liner (the crinkly plastic of the disposable ones bug her), so I can say that if you do fold the seat with the reusable liner on it, the liner takes the abuse of the legs folding into it well without damage. (The reusable is so easy to clean that I've yet to use a disposable liner, so I don't know how well those work). Also, in potty chair formation, it is low to the ground, but this makes going &#34;#2&#34; a lot easier for the child and encourages them to make that step of potty training (or it did for my DD who wouldn't until we got this).The folding mechanism takes some getting used to, but is quick once you do. It is very important that you make sure that the legs are fully clicked into the seat before use though or it will be unstable -- properly clicked, it's fine. We've not used it as a seat on top of a toilet, so I can't speak to that much except that it's so wide when in that formation it won't worry me that the seat will shift and fall into the toilet like some seats do (shift, probably, but not fall).
B0016KV73W Took this on a trip to Asia with our 2 1/2 year old daughter and it was a lifesaver when only squat toilets were available.  Was really surprised at the size - it really did fit in my purse (kind of a medium-sized purse); takes up about as much room as the plastic fold-into-quarters potty seat that we use in public in the US.  Bought the liners as didn't want to be figuring out yet one more thing at the moment of truth.  We normally use public facilities at home but will now carry this as a back-up in the event that we aren't near a rest-stop, or that they are dirty.  Very easy to set up and use - little one wanted to try it as soon as I took it out of the box from Amazon.  Would recommend this to anyone who plans long road trips; trips to other countries where facilities are different styles; or who would like another option when regular facilities are just too foul.
B0016KV73W Okay, I realize that I am putting up a review on a potty seat. Never thought I'd do that but here I am.This is an awesome product. My girls (4.5 and 2.5) love using it when we are out and about because it doesn't move around once it's places on a toilet. I had another foldable potty seat that I used to carry around and I have now chucked it. This one is small enough to be carried in my diaper bag and I like that it comes with a pouch. It's easy to wipe clean and has nice handles they can hold on to while they are using it. All in all, very happy with this purchase and I will definitely be recommending it to other friends.
B0016KV73W Bought this product based on all of the positive reviews and it's a life saver.  We used it everywhere.  Great toilet seat minimizer and very sturdy portable potty.  Makes traveling with a little one so much easier but helpful for being out and about too.  I don't buy the special bags, just use the regular grocery bags.
B0016KV73W My child is scared of &#34;big potties&#34;. When we are on the road or out shopping, this is the lifesaver for &#34;I have to pee now daddy!&#34;. We love it.
B0016KV73W I bought it for my two years old girl. We used it in an airplane, in restaurants rest rooms, in a back of our car, on a toilets anywhere we go and it is always with us. Very small and comfortable to care in a bag. I purchased a waterproof diaper bag for this potty so I fill very comfortable to care it around.
B0016KV73W What a great concept and easy to use.  I have a potty training 3-year-old and a long commute each day.  My daughter goes to daycare in my office building, so unfortunately she must endure the 45 minute commute each way.  Sometimes she can't make it until we get to our destination, so having this travel potty stashed in the back of the SUV has been a lifesaver.  Not only does she think it's fun to use, but even if I don't have easy access to a trash can, the liners do an excellent job on containing the urine until I can safely throw the bag away.  Some people have suggested the use of plastic grocery bags instead of buying the liners.  Unfortunately, I find grocery bags often have small unseen holes in them and do not have the wonderful absorbent pad inside.  Spend the few extra dollars to get the liners that are intended to be used with the potty - you will thank me later!  I also like the fact that the potty comes in a nice storage bag - it keeps it clean while sitting in the back of the SUV and is a great place to store the extra liners.  We don't go anywhere without this potty.  No matter how hard you try to get your toddler to use the potty before you leave somewhere that has a toilet, we all know that it will be only 5-10 minutes later when they actually decide they have to go.
B0016KV73W This saved us from having to find a place for our toddler to go potty in the middle of a family friendly Mardi Grass parade! My girl is also scared of public toilets that have seats that are open at the front edge (which is almost every public toilet seat) so we have had a hard time using public toilets until we got this seat :) Super compact, it will fit inside our backpack! and leave plenty of space for the rest of the things my newborn needs! It comes with a plastic bag so I can just wipe it clean and put it in the bag and it won't touch anything else inside the backpack! We also bought the reusable rubber liner and with both of them we are set to go anywhere! We use this for our adventures out and about and it gives me peace of mind knowing that my baby's buns and little hands won't touch any nasty public restroom toilet seat.
B0016KV73W I have twin toddlers and have several potties/seats at my house.  I LOVE this little seat.  It was the last one that I bought, but it is definitely worth the investment!  For portable potties, I also own:Fisher-Price Potty On-the-GoGinsey Dora Folding Travel Potty SeatIf I had to pick one, the Potette 2-in-1 would probably be it - mainly for its versatility.  This potty can stand alone and be used with the bags that come with it, or, you can use shopping/trash bags (I just use a roll of 4 gallon bags purchased at Target or a \"dollar\" store).  You can also use this potty on top of a real potty by opening the legs.  One of my girls is not a fan of public restrooms and will not use a big potty, but, I can offer her her own (potette) potty, and she'll use that one.  Her sister is willing to use the public potty, and I can use this same potty by putting it on the big potty.  This potty is small enough that it will fit in your purse, backpack, or diaper bag.  The \"carry bag\" that comes with it is just a small plastic bag - nothing fancy.  I have girls, but the front/back of the potette seat has higher edges to act as a spray-shield.  The seat can fit either direction.  The only \"negatives\" I have found is that it fits funny on elongated seats (works but sometimes you have to set the seat all the way to the front or back) and sometimes you have to fiddle with the legs to get them to pop in to the right place (when locking or unlocking).  If you lock the legs properly, the seat is stable (at least for my 30 pounders).The Fisher Price potty is very hard to find, but you can find it online if you search (for a reasonable price).  This potty is VERY stable and has a much larger seat.  We take this with us on trips in addition to the potette but leave it in the truck and carry the Potette in our bag.  I use the same 4 gallon bags.  This potty comes with a really nice shoulder carry bag that includes pockets for \"urine pads\" and bags.  The legs are super easy to pop in to place and to close.  The only negative is that it doesn't work on big potties (it wasn't designed to - but just thought I'd mention it in comparison).The Ginsey folding seats are just too flimsey and they slide all over the place.  Sure, it folds up nice and small, but for a few bucks more, I think the Potette is a better investment.I also own:Baby Bjorn Potty Chair,BABYBJ&Ouml;RN Toilet Trainer - White/Black, BRU potty/seat, two seats like these:Ginsey Dora Soft Potty SeatHint - just use nursing pads in the bottom of the bag to soak up the urine.
B0016KV73W My 2 year old Weighs about 30 lbs and can use this easily! Very portable and light weight! He has learned how to pee standing up thanks to his daddy so when we are in public restrooms, I find the lowest toilet seat then use this as a stepping stool for him and he can go. I'm holding on to him the entire time since his pants are down to his knees amd he can't balance well that way but it does the trick. We will be using this for the beach this summer!Another note, the storage bag that it comes in is plastic so I would recommend buying a medium wetbag (the type you use to put wet cloth diapers in) to use as a permanent storage in diaper bag instead.Great and sturdy!
B0016KV73W My 7 month old happily sits on this potty and does his business.  It fits nicely on any regular toilet making clean up a breeze - just flush!
B0016KV73W I bought this to potty train my daughter before she turned two. Because I was able to be consistent even when we were away from home, she was daytime potty trained in 3 weeks. We liked this so much that we keep one in the car at all times, ready to go, for those really inconvenient \"Potty-potty!\" calls on the road. We travel with this one also. Imagine a full restroom in Disneyland and not having to wait for a stall because you have this. If I had to wait for a stall, we would have had a mess to clean up. I just put down some paper towels on the ground in a corner of the restroom, pull out the Potette, let her sit on it to do her thing. There was some mommy-envy from moms in line for a stall. They asked me where I got it. My 21month old son is nearly daytime potty trained after two weeks. I must say that this is best for 18-24month olds because of its height. For boys especially, one has to be very careful to aim downward or a stream of urine could easily arch up & out.Buy this and you will not regret it when your little one is in big kid underwear and you can be fearless about getting to the potty \"in time\"!
B0016KV73W Once my son was potty trained in the house and we started to go on outings without pull-ups, I knew we were going to need to have an easy-access potty in the car  I actually traveled with the bijorn potty a few times (not a great idea.)  One day I saw a mom friend pull out a Potette for her daughter during a stroller workout at the park.  It was so compact and easy, I knew I had to get one.  So far it hasn't failed me (except the first time I used it without reading the instructions first and didn't \"click\" the legs in place and it collapsed as soon as my son sat on it.  Whoops...user error...)We've used this for long road trips, birthday parties hosted at parks where the bathrooms were far away or just plain filthy dirty, going on a hike, and at the beach.  It lives in our car, tucked in it's baggy, and behind a box of Kleenex.  I seriously don't know why anyone with young children wouldn't have one of these!***Seems like a lot of the negative reviews are from those who failed to lock the legs into the seat.  This takes a little finesse:  You need quite a bit of pressure to pop the legs in, and just the right amount of pressure to \"unlock\" and fold back in.  If you pull too hard, the legs just come detached. Best advice is to practice set-up and take-down a few times before needing to use it.***
B0016KV73W You can't beat the price for this Use-it-anywhere product!  Seriously... I am a first-time and one-time Mom to a beautiful little girl.  I also get squeamish/freaked-out with the thought of her using public bathrooms and the porta-john at the local park.  I'm not a full fledged germaphobe, but the thought of her sitting and holding onto these toilets is beyond gross!This product can be used as a potty seat over any toilet we've encountered AND... here's the best part:  this potty seat can also stand alone and be used as a portable potty chair with a fantastic bag-insert with a biodegradable gel pack to absorb urine.  I've used this for sudden announcements from the back seat declaring, &#34;I gotta make potty right now Mommy!&#34;  We pulled off the highway and found a safe spot to park the car (an office park with lots of trees and a few sparsely parked cars), I assembled the potty chair within seconds and Her Nibs was doing her &#34;business&#34; with comfort and a bit of pride (early in potty training).  We've used it as a stand alone, at the park, and the beach.  just set it up and sit her down... a little blanket or towel for privacy is a nice courtesy for everyone involved as well.  When she's finished we do a quick wipe, up with the pull-up, and I simply tie the bag handles in a knot and toss in the trash.  It's that easy.  I am now going to give this potty seat as a baby shower gift in the future (there are neutral colors).BOTTOM LINE:  Best value for the multiple-setting-use and money.  Super Easy to use.  Sturdy and Safe.  Portable:  fits in my back pack and diaper bag and comes with a plastic drawstring storage bag for hygienic storage.  A must-have item for parents and kiddos who are potty training and are on the go.
B0016KV73W I bought the Potette Plus (green seat with blue legs) at my local Babies R Us about 6 months ago.  At first, I didn't think it was that great.  My main complaint being the seat ring was far too big for a little hiney and my daughter's hiney kept falling INTO it.  Another reviewer made the comparison to it being like the rim of a toilet without the seat - fairly accurate description.  I just measured the hole and it's 6 inches wide by 7 inches long.  Compare that to the Fisher Price On the Go Potty (love that too) which has a hole measuring 4 1/2 inches wide by 6 inches long and it makes a huge difference.  I still believe the hole is much too big, especially since the potty is so low to the ground (only 4 inches tall in it's snapped together standing position!), making it a little hard for younger toddlers to position themselves correctly on it.  I am not sure how the kids in the product pictures are sitting on it with their legs out in front of them - my daughter has to straddle it.  I really believe the ring/seat of this potty could have been made a little smaller (even an inch all around would make a difference), and then it would be absolutely perfect and even easier to tote around.  So those are the only two negatives I have found with this seat.On to the good stuff.  It's small and when folded, can easily fit into a large purse or backpack, and it's lightweight enough to hang it (in a bag of some sort) over a stroller handle.  I used to keep the Fisher Price On the Go potty in my van, but now I only have this one in the van since it's so much smaller, lighter, and I can grab it and put it into a large purse for excursions.My daughter doesn't like to sit on the plastic bag that's supposed to go over the seat, so we had to figure out a way to make that work until she gets used to sitting on the plastic bag.  We cut down a 1 gallon ice cream pail so it would fit under the potty and we use the bags in the bucket, then put the potette over that.  Works great.  For now, I just keep the potty in it's standing position in the van and since it's small enough, it's no big deal.  I found that it fits in a drawstring backpack in it's standing position (even with the cut down bucket, lol), so we don't use the plastic carry bag it came with.  4 gallon trash bags work very well too.I've never used it as a toilet reducer, but I did just place it on both of my different toilet seats at home (one is molded wood, the other is plastic and picky when it comes to toilet reducers).  This seat clicks into flat position and is very sturdy.  There are little grippies on the inside of the legs to help it grab the toilet seat a little and it does help slightly.  Sturdy when on both toilet seats - even when pushed on by me.  On the molded wood seat, the potette fit very nicely, almost center on the toilet seat.  On the plastic seat, I had to push the potette back a little further for it to fit the best.  It would still wiggle a bit with a wiggly toddler.  I didn't buy it for this purpose though so I don't anticipate using it in this position, though it is nice to have the option.
B0016KV73W If you want to go anywhere for more than 30 minutes when potty training, you need something like this.  The things I didn't like about this particular device:  it is too low to the ground and the seat is small, the feet don't stay put unless you snap them in which isn't easy to do (my daughter tipped over twice before I realized how to do it), it requires buying refill bags, I'm not sure we're inserting the bags correctly, and it isn't clear which direction the kids should sit.  While small, it is too big for our older model Valco stroller basket so we have to hang it from the handlebar.  I may try another kind of travel potty, but until then we'll continue to take this on walks and in the car.  It gets the job done.
B0016KV73W We were somewhat nervous about how to go about a day with our toddler, as we are on the go quite a bit in busy New York City.This has made the transition to diaper free so easy, especially as I have a phobia of public toilets. I use it with regular plastic bags (the type you get at grocery stores) and it works well.  Folds easily, and we've used it both for travel and on the go. Well made.
B0016KV73W While potty training is one of the least enjoyable experiences of toddlerdom, this potty is a great addition to the process.  We purchased 3 different ones and she uses this one the most.  We use it at home on our regular toilet with a step stool and when we travel.  It's sturdy, light, and obvious portable and works really well.  Out little almost always chooses this one over the other two we have.
B0016KV73W **Edit. I lost it in a public bathroom and I'm more heartbroken than I should be. I loved this toilet. It made life easy. Mess free.I went and purchased some... crappy kushie folding toilet seat cover and... I hate it. It's nothing like this one.I know it's just a potty, but I really miss it.I think it only adds to my review that I miss this thing so much. It fit 99.9% of every toilet I ran into, minus one that it was a tad too big for.. but the rubber grips still held it on there.There isn't another potty out there like this one and the sooner I get a replacement [it's been two months. -sigh.-] The better.-SIIIGH.-**I didn't buy mine from Amazon because I was too cheap to pay shipping so I found mine on Craigslist instead. Why these parents didn't like this seat I have NO clue!! It's amazing. I bought 10 bags from an ebay seller for 9 bucks thinking I was buying the potty seat before I found it on Craigslist. Got an e-mail a few days later saying they'd accidentally sent me 90. Oh no, what is a girl to do? Now I have a ton of lined bags which is GREAT for when we're out. Parks, deserted parts of the mall if we're a long walk away from a bathroom. I just love it. I threaten my mum and my son's father about ever losing it and what I'll do to both of them if either of them leaves it somewhere. x3 so far they've been very careful.I would recommend this for any parent who's starting their child on the road to potty training young. The bonuses of this seat are;1. It folds up VERY small. Perfect for in the stroller or over night bag.2. It assembles very, very quickly. Even when getting the bag on which can be a bit loud/annoying to do depending on where you are or what time it is. [3am, I don't want to hear a crinkley bag and taking my son to the regular toilet wakes him up too much. I'll be buying a potty special for my bedroom quickly. One that doesn't depend on bags to be a free standing potty]3. Great for younger children just starting to potty train. The hole itself iiiis a bit small, I admit. Nothing to little for my 1.5 year old. I started him on the potty at 14 months and found I was never making it to the bathroom in time when we were out. This has helped me calm down and know that even if I can't find a bathroom I can pull this baby out, pop a bag in and not need to worry about changing a diaper.=D \"this is definately a buy.\" - Fruit Gushers review kid.
B0016KV73W This thing is AMAZING. We literally use it every day when we are out. we use it at restaurants, parks, the back of my car.. EVERYWHERE. Highly recommend.
B0016KV73W We have only had this little potty for a short while, and it has been a lifesaver, and so easy to use. You DO have to push the legs up into the seat until it clicks when you have it in \"seat\" position, not seat-topper position, to get it to be sturdy. There are no instructions on the package, so other reviews are the only reason I know this. Once set up, it is very stable, although short. But the shortness is what makes it so compact and easy to travel with, which is just fine with me. Of course, the ring is small, but I have a 2 year old the size of a three year old and she fits great. The vinyl bag it comes in it very handy to keep it contained when not in use. Some people have said they throw in in their purse, but it really is way too big to fit in a normal-sized diaper bag if you want anything else to fit in there. The vinyl bag is large enough to leave extra bags and wipes in there. The potty fits regular sized grocery sacks, so you can just put one of those on with a paper towel in the bottom and save a ton of money on the overpriced refills. I love this little potty- don't hesitate to buy it if you are on the fence about it!!
B0016KZZG2 After months of dry carpet and adventures in the car, I am finally able to rate this product.  It fits our Nestl&eacute; waters and other bottles along the way.  My rough and tumble boy has only stepped on it once to squirt the water, and in all other cases it has not leaked and gave me peace of mind not using the water fountain. No more water logged shirts and scrambles for a clean cup while in public.  I really like this product.  Please note your child will make teeth marks on the nozzle.  My only complaint is that there are 2 nozzles but only one top (as the picture shows).  Why not provide a top for each nozzle?  We make it work though, and it was still worth it.
B0016KZZG2 This item works great, doesn't leak, semi-hard-to-clean, but still ok. The only real problem I have with this is not the product itself, its the fact that my son LOVES to squeeze the water bottle so the water spouts out way up in the air and then all over everything. If your child doesn't do that, I'd say yes, buy it. But beware the squeezer!! Not a good fit with that one! :)
B0016KZZG2 I bought these spouts based on great reviews but got extremely disappointed when I start using them. They leak badly may be because a lot of water bottles were changed for the past year or so. I wish I got other toppers instead.
B0016KZZG2 We purchased this spout for our 2 year old and are wishing we would have purchased it earlier.Pros:- Non leak spout- 2 year old can use it easilyCons:- larger than expected, but doesn't harm its effectiveness.
B0016KZZG2 Works as described!  And it does create a kind of vacuum so the bottle will collapse as you drink, but still-- just pop the cap off and back on again and that solves that problem.
B0016KZZG2 This is a good spill proof top as long as the one using it doesn't squeeze the bottle. It does leak if the bottle is squeezed. I wouldn't recommend for use with anything but water, because water doesn't stain.
B0016KZZG2 Air gets trapped and the bottle caves in. Would not recommend these. Good concept but doesn't really work well.  Waste of money.
B0016KZZG2 These are great for babies and toddlers. My twins love water. So I send them to preschool with mini water bottles & these lids. (plus my one year old can use them too) The teachers send them home with the twins at the end of the day. All my friends love them when they come to visit because their kids won't make a mess in the house when running around with their drink. I would suggest it to anyone.
B0016LVB4Q So worth the buy - super soft, great quality and washes well... get two so you always have one on hand! Again 'Carters rocks'!
B0016LVB4Q Nothing wrong with the product itself, but after purchasing and using for a couple weeks with my newborn, I realized that changing pad covers are NOT worth the trouble (and someone please tell me why I thought brown would be an appropriate color... It hides the poo?). After throwing one away because it simply wasn't salvageable, the second one was neatly folded in a closet where, 10 months later, it remains.
B0016LVB4Q Durable cover--it's held up well with multiple washings so far (3 months) and stains come out well (using Bac-Out and sometimes OxiClean). Currently using it over an IKEA blow-up changing pad, so it's a generous fit; but it fits our other change pad. The cute \"bumps\" on the fabric are going away on the area that gets the most wear--the side where my baby's bottom/back lay while changing--which is disappointing. Doesn't look as nice now, so I give it only 4 stars.
B0016LVB4Q So So So SOFT!!! Love this item so much, i purchased another one! Great quality and my little boy seems to like the softness.
B0016LVB4Q I absolutely love this changing pad cover. It is very, very soft and fit very well and brown is a really good choice for obvious reasons :) It is really cozy and comfortable. I would recommend getting two (in brown) so that you always have one ready while the other is being washed. Definitely worth the money.
B0016LVB4Q I really like this changing pad cover. its very soft and is easy to get on and off the changing pad. only problem is that sometimes while changing my daughter she likes to pee and this doesn't absorb any moisture and it runs off onto the floor.
B0016LVB4Q I bought this for my son's changing pad.  We had some ugly yellow ones we got at a consignment sale so I was ready to get something that went with his decor a little bit more.This is perfect!  It washes up soft and didn't come apart.  The bumps give texture for him to feel while I am changing him.  You really can't go wrong with this cover!
B0016LVB4Q I love how soft this is! The color is great, the bumps really aren't a problem and it is easy to put on and take off.
B0016LVB4Q I love these covers so much that I bought 3 of them - they will get spit up on and peed on so be sure to have at least 1 extra to put on when the other is being washed. I got 3 for this purpose. They are SO soft and add a great touch of texture and color to the room.
B0016LVB4Q So there's really not a lot to say about this pad cover. It's very soft and seems to be well made. We've washed it a couple times now and it's holding up well.I guess the only thing I worry about is that it's a really nice cover for a place we're changing diapers. While we've only had one accident on it so far it does seem likely to get ruined pretty easily and quickly. Especially since our daughter loves to squirm while having her diaper changed and the pad belt doesn't really do the trick when it comes to holding her still. It just keeps her from sitting up.To top it off when we took the cover off to wash it she really didn't seem to notice the difference, which made me think that the cover is more of a novelty than a necessity.I will say that it is really soft and snuggly. If she notices the difference at all (or cares) then it is a nice cover.My wife did point out that without the cover when she did have her accident the changing pad is water resistant so it would've gone everywhere and run off the pad. But since the cover soaked it up... disaster averted.That said I think it was a pretty good buy but I think a regular cotton cover would've been just as effective.As I mentioned, it's a bit over the top but it is nice.UPDATESo it's been awhile since we got this and as I mentioned my biggest concern was it getting ruined.Well it's still in great condition. It's been drawn on with some markers and we've had some accidents, it's been washed more times than I can count and it is still soft and white.We use charlies soap which is pretty gentle on clothes to begin with so that may be part of it but I have to admit I'm pretty impressed with the cover.It's comfortable and durable. The same can be said for most all the Carters brand stuff we've bought for my daughter.
B0016LVB4Q love this changing pad cover. decided to buy the carters brand after purchasing a major retail store brand cover, which was not soft at all. carters is the best for all things baby. love it, baby loves it too. its not rough on her skin, for when she rolls to the side as i change her. i would def. recommend , and would guy again.
B0016LVB4Q We've been using this pad (in Ecru) for nearly a year and it's held up really well. It's soft and the ecru is a nice color that seems to wash pretty well. I always keep it covered with one of theseCarters Keep Me Dry Flannel Bassinet Pad, Ecrupads on top of it. Makes messes very easy to clean up. I also got a similar BOPPY cover in sage. I prefer the Carter's Ecru one though.
B0016LVB4Q This is the best diaper changing cover.  They wash up great as well.  I actually use them over the mini co-sleeper as well - they fit it perfectly.
B0016LVB4Q Changing pad cover is great.  We have 2 so we can wash one and have one on the changing pad.
B0016LVB4Q Love the softness of this cover. Nothing much else to say since it's all in the description, but I'd definitely buy again. And of course I'd buy at amazon a million times over babies-r-us; they are such a rip off. Free shipping with prime and no tax with amazon, you can't beat that!Also, fits mySimmons Kids Contour Dressing Table Pad with Non-Skid Bottomand any other standard changing pad. Just don't buy that changing pad for the non-skid (because there is no non skid!!!!)
B0016LVB4Q I love how soft this changing pad is!  It also holds up well to multiple washings and dryings.  It's very pretty addition to my nursery.
B0016LVB4Q Love the mute color and dots! Super soft and it is going to look great with my crib bedding, neutral and pristine.
B0016LVB4Q The green color is very pretty. Sort of a silvery green. Gender neutral.  The material is soft and silky.  I Love it!! Have washed it 3-4 times with no issues at all. Fits both of my changing pads (standard ones) perfectly.  If it were a bit less expensive I'd buy 5 of them in all different colors!
B0016LVB4Q This fits well over the Summer Infant Contoured Changing Pad that we ordered, and is really nice and soft without being too plush. I haven't washed it a lot, but seems like the quality will hold up through multiple washings. The color was a nice neutral, not too pink or yellow as some Ecrus tend to get. Good product for the price.
B0016LVB4Q We have this in fuschia too.  It's so soft, really nice to put your baby on.  The chocolate is a deep, rich color which has not faded with washing (I was this in cold with our dark clothes).  It looks nice and serves its function.  I'd love one in lime green, Carter's {:-)
B0016LVB4Q So soft and fits the changing pad well, even has cut outs for the changing pad straps. Only wish I would have got more than one.
B0016LVB4Q This changing pad cover is super soft and super cute! I washed the pad cover and kept its softness and fits my chaning pad cover great. I love the light pink color. I would def. order more covers from Carters.
B0016LVB4Q Another quality product from Carter's. These hold up well in the wash, and are super soft. They fit all standard changing pads very well. I would also suggest using a changing pad liner over this cover - so if your baby has a blow-out you are cleaning up, you don't have to change this cover every time!
B0016LVB4Q This changing pad cover is super soft and washes really well.  We have three of these and wash them all the time and after 9 months they still look new and actually seem even softer (and they were soft to begin with).  We have it in off white.
B0016LVB4Q This is the best changing pad ever. It is super soft and durable. Easy to wash and holds up great. Haven't had any problems with it so far.
B0016LVB4Q great quality, great color.  no complaints on this one!  I like the velour type covers for changing table over other stuff.
B0016LVB4Q I really like this changing pad cover; it fits perfectly and snugly, it looks nice, and it is really, really soft (and it's brown, so it does hide stains.  Unfortunately, I would also say that this is one of the least useful baby-related purchases I made - I never use it.  I did use it at first, but it got pooped and peed on constantly and I quickly realized that it was stupid to cover up the plastic, wipe-able changing pad with something I needed to wash every time.
B0016LVB4Q This fit our summer infant changing pad. Very soft cover and easy to put on and take off. Looks sharp in our nursery with the soft dots.
B0016LVB4Q This showed up exactly as I expected and as pictured.  It is soft and durable.  I would definitely reccomend this item to other moms.
B0016LVB4Q Very happy with the cover! It looks great in the room and it is just so darn soft!
B0016LVB4Q This changing pad cover is soft, durable, and fits the changing pad great! If it's anything like Carter's sheets, it's going to hold up for a LONG time as well! Great product. Very happy!
B0016LVB4Q I have no complaints about this cover. It fits well and is soft. There is really nothing special about it. I might like it better if it didn't get soaked so easily.
B0016LVB4Q Its great, baby loves it, contoured sides give secure feeling to squirmy baby. Fits LA Baby 4 sided changing pad 32&#34;. I bought &#34;pink&#34; ;-)
B0016LVB4Q I am pleasantly suprised by this purchase.  The cover is very soft for the baby and (possibly more important) not cheesy looking like many others I've seen.  It blends right in with our decor.
B0016LVB4Q I agree with the other reviewers:  this is a superb cover in terms of softness, fit, quality, etc.  However, if you are on the fence about what kind of changing pad cover to get, hold off.  Ours spends more time in the washing machine because of spit up and other wonders of baby changing, so we end up using receiving blankets and cloth diapers over our changing pad a lot of the time.  If you have the money, get two.  If you would rather save some money, this is one of those items that you can scratch off of your list.  I love this particular cover, just not the impracticality of covers in general.
B0016LVB4Q Super SoftEasy to care forDoesn't shrinkNice Calm sage color (goes well in our nursery)Hasn't changed over time and I've washed mine enough timesI only bought one and it's been fine.
B0016LVB4Q I purchased this cover in Chocolate for a Serta changing pad. It is so soft, my baby loves to be put down on it. She gets all smiley and just loves the feeling. The elasticized edges fit the Serta pad perfectly. I decided to buy a back up cover in Sage and was very pleased at how the cover didn't stain. I was afraid with a lighter color that spit up and accidents might leave stains but my worries were unfounded. Great cover, I'll probably buy another soon!
B0016LVB4Q This changing pad cover is so ridiculously soft, I love it!!!  The chocolate color looks slightly washed out, but I love the way it feels!!!  I am definitely buying a couple more to keep on hand so that I will always have a clean one handy, but decided to go with the baby blue color.  I am thinking that my espresso colored baby furniture may have something to do with my not liking the chocolate color. . . it's all too dark.  I know baby will be so comfy during his diaper changes.  Also fits our infant summer contoured changing pad perfectly.  Couldn't be happier with this product.
B0016LVB4Q We couldn't ask for anything softer. This is an excellent changing pad cover and it holds up very well wash after wash.
B0016LVB4Q I have had these covers for over a year, and I still love them.Pros:They are soft.They match the jungle theme in my baby's nurseryThey do not show a single stain after over a year of useThey wash and dry very well. No pilling and still very soft.They are affordable.Cons:They are not organic.Overall, I am super pleased with this purchase and it is one of the few items I bought for the nursery I would buy again.
B0016LVB4Q This is the perfect changing pad cover. It washes well and is super soft for my babies skin. The cover does not fit too tight so it is easy to take off and put back on my changing pad. Plus the brown color matches my son's room perfectly. Would change nothing about this product.
B0016LVB4Q I bought this cover to use with the  Summer Infant Contoured Changing Pad, also purchased on Amazon.  I was very impressed with both products being decent value and high quality.  This is the softest material changing pad and is soo adorable to add to our nursery.  Glad I found this!
B0016LVB4Q This changing pad cover is super soft and cleans up well.  I recommend getting waterproof lap pads to put under baby's bottom otherwise you may be washing the cover more than you want (especially with newborns who will often continue their diaper destruction with the diaper off!).  We also have the Ecru and are pleased with both colors.  Would buy again.
B0016LVB4Q We have this changing pad cover in 3 colors. It is very soft, and holds up well in the wash: messes come out without special treatment, and after 3 months of being laundered several times a week is still as soft as the first day we used it. It fits our changing pad well, has elastic all the way around (not just the corners), and has slots for the changing pad's safety harness.
B0016LVB4Q I love this changing table cover, it is so soft and comfortable. It has been washed numerous times already and still looks great. It stretches perfectly to fit over the pad and stays snug enough to not move excessively. The color is great too since it doesn't show stains like light colors.
B0016LVB4Q This changing pad cover is so soft, I'm sure my baby will love snuggling into it.  Can't wait for him to use it.
B0016LVB4Q We purchased this to cover the Summer Infant changing pad. It fit perfectly, super soft, easy to wash and still in great shape a year and a half later.
B0016LVB4Q It is a perfect fit, just like people were saying in the other reviews. I actually ordered two so we have an extra.
B0016LVB4Q This changing pad cover is so soft and fits the changing pad perfectly!  I would definitely recommend this product.  I might order an extra one for when this one is being washed.
B0016LVB4Q I love the fabric and how soft it feels, just right for a baby. I haven't had my baby yet so I don't know how will it turn out to be after several washes, although my mom just washed it for the first use and nothing happened to the fabric yet. Hope its a good buy so that I can buy more of these things in future. I think amazon has the best price too, so thanks :)
B0016LVB4Q We used this to cover our summer infant bassinet pad, that we use in our Graco mini pack and play.  These sheets fit perfectly.  We also use them in rotation on our changed pad on the changing table.
B0016LVB4Q Love it! Super soft, looks great and fits changing pad perfectly! I washed it many times on hot/cold and the color seems to hold.
B0016LVB4Q Love these changing pad covers! I had one of these, and one of another brand. I liked this one so much, I went and bought a second, and discarded the other one I had. They're cute, soft, and have held up great so far. We have a contour pad with 3 raised sides, and they fit perfectly. My son is 10 months old, and we've used these covers since birth.
B0016LVB4Q I love the super soft fabric. We use this withLA Baby 4 Sided Changing Pad 32\", Whiteand it fits perfect!
B0016LVB4Q These changing pads are exactly as described.  They are super soft, and wick away moisture easily. I also like the ecru color as it blends easily with any decor.
B0016LVB4Q As it says this product is very soft.  Went on very easily and looks great in the nursery, happy with my purchase.
B0016LVB4Q We've used this cover 6 1/2 months.  So glad we spent the extra few dollars for this nicer-looking cover.  It's color looks like the picture, it's durable--have washed it half a dozen times.  We use a waterproof pad liner on top of it, but it seems it would hold up well regardless.  We have the Diaper Genie changing pad and its wide straps do not fit through the strap holes in this cover.  Also, the holes are so near the cover's edge that the holes are underneath the pad.  And the Diaper Genie straps come out the side of the pad.  So we just ended up not using the holes.  Eventually I'll get around to sewing a new hole where it should be for our pad.
B0016LVB4Q Love this cover...so I bought two more to keep on hand.  It is so soft and fits my pad nicely.  Highly recommend, especially ove regular cotton covers.
B0016LVB4Q This is so soft it is so nice for my baby. It is always warm which is great for the baby. Washes great, washed mine at least 10 times and still looks brand new. Love the color, doesnt show any stains inbetween washes.
B0016LVB4Q Nice changing pad, super soft!  Well, I can tell you with 100% accuracy that this washes very well and it is still super-soft even after all these washings.  Fits well on the changing pad and easy to put on/take off. Glad we have some of these!
B0016LVB4Q These are very soft and durable and fit my contoured changing pad perfectly (I thought all covers would, but that's not true - I bought another one from a big name store that did not work at all!). Unfortunately, I haven't used mine a great deal - my little one likes to mess all over the changing pad the minute we take her diaper off and I got tired of washing the covers all the time! Lol! But when she gets a little bigger and a little more predictable, they will definitely go back on...
B0016LVB4Q We love love this! super soft, easy to wash & come on brown is perfect. Bought 2 but I think I'm going to get a third
B0016LVB4Q This is a great changing pad cover. It's incredibly soft and washes really well. I have bought a lot of Carter's velour stuff and have been happy every time with it! Their velour crib sheets are also amazing.
B0016LVB4Q We are pleased with this product, though it is quite expensive, if I must say so. I think it's going to work out nicely with our changing pad. We got a large, 4-sided changing pad, and it fits pretty well. I mean, it doesn't hug it like a glove, but we are okay with that. It is going to provide the function that it was designed for quite nicely. I would probably not recommend this for smaller changing pads, as it may be too loose on them. I can see a baby grabbing on and pulling it right off in the middle of a changing, which might spell a messy disaster...
B0016LVB4Q This is sooo soft! And it's adorable, washable, and comfy. I highly recommend to anyone to buy this product. It is wonderful
B0016LVB4Q THe cover is soft, easy to clean and has lasted two years and is still going strong with baby number two!
B0016LVB4Q This is a must have (in any color) for a baby nursery.  These covers are soft and comfortable and they hold up to lots of washes!
B0016LVB4Q We own two of this changing pad cover in the \"chocolate\" color.  (My goal was to always have one clean, in case the other got dirty during a changing.)  They are incredibly soft.Despite dozens of washings, they look pretty much new.  No fading, no thinning of the material.Highly recommended.
B0016LVB4Q Super soft and cute!! Seems very durable and color is true to description. I was concerned about it not conforming to the changing pad I have as  it has raised edges but no issues.
B0016LVB4Q These changing pad covers are wonderful.  I currently have two changing pads,Summer Infant 4-Sided Changing PadandSummer Infant Contoured Changing Pad.  This cover fits both perfectly.Before I purchased these, my baby hated to have her diaper changed.  She never complained about having her diaper changed again after I started using the Carters' Super Soft Dot Changing Pad Cover.They are amazingly soft and have not been damaged by the washing machine (on gentle cycle) or the dryer.  I would recommend these changing pad covers to anyone.
B0016LVB4Q Love this, own it in a variety of colors. These are SO soft, look great in the nurery, and still look and feel wonderful after many washes. They fit my long changing pad quite nicely. You can find cheaper pads, but to me this is worth the price, I feel it is very comfortable for my baby and it's holding up nicely.
B0016LVB4Q This comes exactly as shown a bright brown and super soft to the touch. My 4 month old loves to run his hands along the &#34;bumps&#34; in the material!
B0016LVB4Q This changing pad cover fits securely and is very soft. Perfect for the babies room. Very delicate to the touch.
B0016LVB4Q This has held up well over the last year. Washed tons of times and still as soft and cute as ever!
B0016LVB4Q This changing pad cover is fantastic.  It is so soft and feels great to the touch while the raised dots give it just the right amount of texture.  Baby is sure to love it! The pink is a beautiful color that is sure to complement the decor of just about any girl's room.
B0016LVB4Q This cover is great. it is soft and plush. it goes great with the colors of our nursery. its chocolate color that you see in the picture is true to the color that it really is. you should always have 2 covers and i would order two of this cover in a heartbeat.
B0016LVB4Q We love this changing pad cover. We got 2. It is so plush and comfy for baby. Very soft and makes the room look nice. Looks much more expensive than others on the market. I have zero complaints and would absolutely buy this again. I've washed it over and over the last 5 months and no signs of wear.
B0016LVB4Q The pink cover was very close to the color pictured. I has remained baby soft even after repeated washing and air drying. I also purchased the same cover in off white at a local store and they both are holding up extremely well. Extremely pleased with this product!
B0016LVB4Q This changing pad cover is super soft and the size is perfect for fitting over a 16\" x 32\" pad.  Great to have an extra on hand for when one is being washed.
B0016LVB4Q i will not return because its a bit of a hassle, this looks nice its a very pale pink!the fabric feels a bit thin, not sure how long it will last...worth the money tho if u don't want to spend a whole lot
B0016LVB4Q Fits over my summer infant changing pad perfectly even after multiple washes & drys in hot.  It's very soft and the dots add a nice texture.  The brown is a rich deep color.  Looks great with my espresso crib!
B0016LVB4Q We have 3 of these in different colors/styles.  Like some other reviewers, we also use the keep-me-dry lap pads on top of the changing cover to catch accidents.  Have washed these many times and they still look great - very easy to care for and a reasonable price.  They are also super, super soft, which we love for our Little One.
B0016LVB4Q Doesn't soak through, cleans up well, still looks great & fits great even after a handfull of accidents and washes.  Plus it's cute.
B0016LVB4Q Very soft and comfy, better than others out there- buy several as tehy get dirty frequently! a must have for baby
B0016LVB4Q This changing cover is the perfect shade of pale pink for our nursery. I really didn't want anything too bright as we've used all pastel colors. It seems very soft and fits our old changing pad from pottery barn kids. Will be ordering a couple more to have back ups.
B0016LVB4Q My daughter really likes this changing cover. It is soft and warm for her many diaper changes. It washes nicely and doesn't require any special instructions. I think I am going to get it in another color too.
B0016LVB4Q I had hoped that this cover would be nice, and I am not let down. Very soft, and it fits the changing pad mattress perfectly. Thank you!Edit: I ordered the Graco Travel Lite Crib (more like a cross between a small pack n play & bassinet though) for our baby & someone suggested using this Super Soft Dot Cover to cover the Summer Infant Bassinet Pad that I got to go inside it. I was not let down! It not only fits the pad perfectly, it is so super soft against baby's skin too! I love it so much that I ordered another one to switch them out when one is being washed. I now own the chocolate, ecru, and sage colored ones, and am contemplating getting the pink one too. These are so perfect for both changing table pad cover & bassinet pad cover alike!!!!! All of the above mentioned can be found here on Amazon.
B0016LVB4Q My baby loves laying on his changing pad, even when not being changed because this is so soft and comfy! It fits our changing pad just right (elastic around the whole bottom). The color is nice and neutral, but just make sure to wash it with like colors or it will slightly change colors.
B0016LVB4Q I love the \"minky\" fabric that this changing cover is made with. It is super soft, a great soft pink color, and it washes well. I even put it in the dryer and it didn't shrink or change the fabric at all. Very nice cover for the price.
B0016LVB4Q We have 1 sage & 1 pink cover that we've been using for a little over 13 months and they are still in PERFECT condition.We have twin girls which means twice the diaper changes which means twice the chance of these getting soiled & needing washed. Especially when they were newborns they liked to pee all over once we got their diapers off. These have been washed a TON of times, both on delicate & regular cycle & then on regular in the dryer and they show no signs of wear, still look like new, still have the raised dots and are still super soft! They also slip easily over our changing pad.If you have twins or more, I definately recommend getting at least 2 of these, maybe more. Also, you can get the mini water resistant pads(quite a few) and put that under babys bottom when you change them...then if they pee or if they're being really honery and poo, you just have to change the soiled pad & not this cover. You can also buy the water resistant pads meant for a crib and cut them small enough to use for the changing pad.
B0016LVB4Q Soft.  Nice color.  Fits great.  The dots are dots.  Nothing special about them.  What else can I say, it works.
B0016LVB4Q All of my Carter's textiles have done the same exact thing within a year's time.  The elastic gives out.  This changing pad cover does not even have the slightest bit of stretch left, so I have to tuck it under the pad, and it comes off all the time.  I do not wash them abnormally frequently--only when very soiled, with is not often.  I think it averages out to washing each cover once every 6 weeks.I really cannot understand how this gets a 5-star rating.  I would give it 0 stars if I could.  And since I have multiple other Carter bedding items and they have all done the same thing, I know I don't have a \"fluke.\"  My other branded textiles have not done this, as they are still stretchy after 3 years of continual use.Invest in higher quality if you need it to last over a year.  I know this is the only negative review so far, but please know that I am being as honest and accurate as I can.
B0016LVB4Q Love it!  This changing pad cover is so soft and plush feeling.  I have had this for several months now and it has not shrunk and still looks new.  I have espresso finish for the crib set in my babies room and this matches with the furniture so well.  Highly recommend!
B0016LVB4Q Nice color, soft sheets, appears to be a quality product. However, took forever to receive. Got these to match Carson's chocolate velour crib sheets, and its a perfect match.
B0016LVB4Q True color (it's a pale sage green).  Very soft and fit the standard changing pad perfect.  We are very happy with the purchase.
B0016LVB4Q This is a soft cover and I love the texture. It washes well and I dryed on low to avoid shrinkage.
B0016LVB4Q This changing pad cover is super soft!  It's comfortable for the baby and is nice looking.  This pad holds up extremely well in the washing machine.  The material seems to be of high quality and like it will last for some time.  I will say if you get some stains on it get to them quickly because they will set into this pad.
B0016LVB4Q Very soft and fits my changing pad perfectly.  This changing pad also washes well without shrinkage or pilling of fabric.
B0016LVB4Q I bought this to match the crib bumpers. Just like the bumper the fabric is super soft. I do not have a contoured changing pad but rather a flat one and this fits perfectly.
B0016LVB4Q I love these!  I bought two (one for the changing station, and one for her bassinet) They're soft and easy to wash.
B0016LVB4Q Great changing pad cover. It is super soft, easy to wash, pretty, and durable. There is nothing more you can really want from a cover. It has holdes for the straps, which we don't use, but they are there if you need them.My baby loves the texture on them and likes to run her hands over the little soft bumps as I change her. Good to have something else distract her so I have an extra few seconds for the diapers change.Most importantly, it has lasted many many many washes.There are plenty of colors. We have sage and pink and like them both (good tones, not too bright, match with everything we have).
B0016LVB4Q Pros:-Soft... in fact, still as soft as the day we opened it and it has been through the washer/dryer 8 times now!-It does not hold a stain! We bought this in the Ecru, and it has been covered in bright yellow baby poop about 4 times now, and each time it comes out of the washer as clean and stain-less as can be! I was sure we ruined it after the first \"explosive baby poop\" fiasco, but it does not have a SINGLE stain on it.-It still looks brand new and like I said, it has been through the wash 8 times! Normally fuzzy fabrics like this don't hold up in the washer/dryer.
B0016LVB4Q Really like this pad cover for the following reasons:- it's soft and baby likes it- it's easy to wash- lasted for 3+ yrs and 2 kids and it looks/feels exactly the same; also does not shrinkgood buy.
B0016LVB4Q It fits the changing pad well, has slits for the safety straps, and cleans up easily in the washing machine.  No weird smells or itchy bits.
B0016LVB4Q Love the feel of this. Much better than the rough terry fabric seen on most changing pad covers. My baby notices the difference.
B0016LVB4Q this is so soft and they make crib sheets in the same fabric and its so soft. best cover i've found yet.
B0016LVB4Q I love this changing pad it's sooooo soft and comfy. My baby is very comfortable resting when I'm changing her diaper. Would recommend this product especially for winter. I order several because they can be used as bassinet sheets!!!!
B0016LVB4Q Love love love this! I need to buy more so when I wash this one I have another to replace it (hello blowouts). So soft be my baby loves laying on her changer. If I left her there all day I'm sure she'd love it. Ha!
B0016LVB4Q I really like this cover, wish I could buy sheets for the crib just as this one. It looks and feels great.
B0016LVB4Q The fabric is very soft, and I haven't had a problem getting stains out of it. I had bought a rather large changing pad and was afraid this wouldn't fit, but in fact it fits quite well. The photo of the sage color is a little misleading; I would describe it as more of a forest-y green.
B0016LVB4Q These are so wonderfully soft and easy to put on and take off because lord knows you will wash it elevnty billion times before its all said and done.  We liked it so much we bought the same one when we bought another diaper change station.
B0016LVB4Q This cover has worked really well on our changing pad. It's ultra soft (our cat likes to use it as a napping spot) and it soaks up leaks quickly without letting them get all over everything. It also has held up well so far to our washing machine (we've used it for about a month). Plus, the chocolate color is great and the raised dots are cute. It goes on and off our changing pad with ease, and stays on well. I recommend having two pad covers so that you can wash one cover and still have another one to use.
B0016LVB4Q The fabric color and texture is great. Fits my changing table pad perfectly and is easy to remove to clean!
B0016LVB4Q This cover is just what I was looking for, attractive and soft. I would have given it 5 stars, but I have not had it very long and I have no idea how durable it is. So far, so good!
B0016LVB4Q this is not only soft and beautiful but it washes well and holds up well over time.  My baby is now 6 months old and the covers all still look brand new after 6 months of washing and drying
B0016LVB4Q For my first son I only used the terrycloth covers, but decided to try this out for my second son: I love them!  They looks nice after being washed (on hot) and after going through the dryer (on medium heat) and they fit my 4-sided changing pad very well.  Will buy more of these for sure!
B0016LVB4Q This changing pad is super soft but it stained so easily! Every time it got a little bit of diaper cream on it, the spot of diaper cream turned gray in the wash. After a few months it looked so terrible that I threw it out. I bought a yellow one and the same thing happened. My son is 10 months old and very squirmy so it's nearly impossible to prevent diaper cream from getting on the changing pad. I have 2 terry cloth changing pad covers (1 white, 1 blue) that do not get the same gray stains. I definitely recommend terry cloth over this material.ProsGood Size And FitNice PatternSoftConsStains Easily
B0016LVB4Q I did not think I was going to like this and only bought it because it was recommended to go with the changing pad I bought. But I was pleasantly surprised at how soft it is. Looks good and feels well made. Have not washed it as yet but I hope the color does not fade.
B0016LVB4Q I love these- soft, well made, pretty sage color.  I bought two with our first child.  Bought a third with our second.  Two would probably do, as I use the changing table less- and the living room floor more!  But, don't mind, as these are great.  Durable, too, with all the washing, and will be able to pass long to my sister when she has kids.
B0016LVB4Q I own three of these since I'm constantly changing them out. They're very soft and fit my changing pad great. I wish that they had a better selection of colors though.
B0016LVB4Q Easy to wash, and super fluffy. Our 2 month old loves it! I would strongly recommend to anyone in search of a new changing pad cover.
B0016LVB4Q Super soft and has a nice snug fit over the changing pad. If this is your first child, make sure you have three changing pad covers. We started with two, but I quickly found that three made things easier and I didn't feel like I was always having to do a load of laundry because the changing pad covers were dirty.
B0016LVB4Q This changing pad cover is SUPER soft and fits perfectly on my changing pad (Summer Infant Contoured Changing Pad). It even has slits so the buckles can come through. I've used it for a year and washed several times and have had no problems. This is a great quality pad.
B0016LVB4Q I was mostly worried about this shedding in the wash. So far, it has held up amazingly well, even washing in hot water with diapers. When I worked in a daycare, we just used a bare changing pad, and wiped down after every change. While that works in an institutional setting, I wanted something a little cozier for my own baby. This is super soft and works in cold and warm temperature to keep baby comfortable on the changing pad. We do a lot on our changing table besides just diaper changes. Giving vitamins, cleaning ears and nose, washing hands and face, singing songs, learning about body parts, even baby massage. The changing table is a bonding place for me and my baby. So it's worth it to me to have such a nice surface for baby to lay on. On the practical side, it does a decent job of repelling minor &#34;spills&#34; so in the event of an accident, I can get baby off the table and pull the cover off before anything undesirable soaks through to the pad, giving me a bigger mess to clean up. The cover goes right in the laundry, a quick wipedown of the pad, and I'm ready to put a new cover on. In fact, I bought two, so my changing pad never goes &#34;naked&#34; while one is in the wash.
B0016LVB4Q I love this changing pad cover. It's soft and cozy so my daughter doesn't mind lying on it while I change her. It's easy to wash and has held up nicely for me so far.
B0016LVB4Q This is such a soft changing pad cover. I love minky anything and this is no different. It matches the nursery decor perfectly
B0016LVB4Q This was a great product at a great price. I like how it is less bulky than the fleece ones sold at Target so it is easy to store. It is soft and has held up well in the 7 months we've used it.
B0016LVB4Q This is a very nice changing pad cover. It's soft, pretty colored, and thick and luxurious feeling. My only word of advice is to check out the harder-to-find on Amazon Carter's giraffe printed one before buying this one. We got both to have a spare, but really only needed one. The giraffe one is truly awesome.
B0016LVB4Q You cannot go wrong with this brand, the texture is soft, the color is perfect for a little girls room and fits all standard changing pads.
B0016LVB4Q I love this cover!  It adds some softness and warmth to the cold, plastic and waterproof changing pad.  I've washed it many times over the last year and it has held up well.  I love the little slits in the side to thread the safety belt through!  I didn't notice those until a few months ago and thought I'd mention it in case others hadn't noticed either!
B0016LVB4Q The material on this changing pad is SOFT. We've only been using it for a short time but it gets washed frequently. There has been no degradation after all the times it's been through the washer and dryer. I'd highly recommend this over a generic brand, it'll last.
B0016M10C8 I got these so my son wouldn't have his bare back on the cold plastic changing pad when we change him. My changing pad doesn't have a belt, so the slits are useless to me but they don't bother me or get in the way. These are nice and they wash well. We always have one on the pad and if he wets through it then we can quickly swap it out for the second one while the first is washing. I like these much better than the plastic thin Boppy brand ones I got at my baby shower.
B0016M10C8 I washed the changing pad covers according to the directions, and they turned rough and fuzzy.  REALLY fuzzy on the back of it, and kind of fuzzy on the top.  It is also impossible to get poop stains out of it...and with a new baby, poop will be everywhere!  We have just started to lay a hand towel down on the changing table.  It is bigger than these crummy pads and stains come out much better!
B0016M10C8 These pads are of great quality. I gave it 4 stars because its not what i thought it was. i was looking for changing pads only, not changing table pads. I want to put them in my diaper bag to use when we're out and i need to change the  baby. I don't want to use them on the changing table, which is what its intended for.  I will keep them because they are really nice and thick and soft and i can still use them in my diaper bag.
B0016M10C8 These are awful. They do not stay put. They are too small to cover vinyl completely. Should have some sort of slidproofing on back.
B0016M10C8 I thought these changing pad covers would fit the entire changing pad... but they only cover the flat middle part (on our Graco pack'n play it's the part that is tan in the middle) which is ok, but our little guy is getting bigger and bigger everyday and his entire body doesn't even fit on it (he is only 3 months old). I like using the pad covers because they keep him from laying on the cold changing pad, but with these his feet still hang off. He hasn't seemed to mind, so I give the product a 4 instead of something lower, but I was a little dissapointed that they didn't cover the entire changer!
B0016M10C8 I knew before purchasing this item that it was small. I knew that it would only cover the bottom of the pack n play changing pad to offer protection from the hard cold plastic. I have not used them yet as they were a shower gift, but they have washed well and will fit perfectly in the bottom of the changing pad and provide protection which is all I need it to do. My friends who own these say they hold up well and are a must buy.
B0016N3SF4 My daughter loves this in the bath with her.  They are very cute and a fun toy that we also gave as a gift and that child loved as well.
B0016N3SF4 I like this bath set, it was a cute change from yellow ducks. drawback is the plastic rings deflated days later, but the frogs are durable
B0016N3SF4 My son is still too young to play with these but I love them at bathtime.  I use them to distract him (2.5 mo old) while his dad washes him down.  Not sure how long these will keep his attention but they're so cute.  I was concerned about how long the air would last in the rings but after 1 mo in the tub they are still filled and buoyant.
B0016N3SF4 super cute and just love the floaties.  great price, made a perfect baby shower gift, gender neutral makes it an easy pick
B0016N3SF4 I play with it as much as a baby does. Very nicely done. Idea of floating rings with frogs on them is just unbelievable. Would recommend for any age.
B0016N3SF4 We used this as a diaper cake topper for my sisters baby shower. Her theme obviously rubber duckies. Perfect decor and baby bath toy after. Very happy.
B0016N3SF4 Looks very elegant. The classic rubber duck!  Baby loves it and it just beautifies he bath. Good material - seems durable. Lovely colors.
B0016N3SF4 From the moment I saw these froggies on my friends baby's pictures I fell in love with them. I ordered this toy, and loved it even more after seeing it in person. My 9 months old daughter loves to play with baby frogs, and to chew on the floaties. She even snuck one of the floaties to her crib a couple of times. A very cute, well-made, functional toy.
B0016N7IJ6 I am a huge fan of these placemats.  They are not smelly and plasticky and do the job.  They seem to hold up well with lots of food smeared all over them.  I would love the stickem to be a bit more tacky but we make it work.  They are also biodegradeable and affordable.
B0013OX9NC I can't give this 5 stars yet. I'm waiting to see if I can SEE the four stars without the benefit of my glasses and hopefully, these Lutein supplements will help me do so.I like that they're easy to swallow and don't \"come back up.\"  Lutein is a great way to guard against macular degeneration so I'm looking forward (literally) to seeing the results.I will update this review soon to share the results.
B0013OX9NC Lutein is a chemical found in healthy eyes. There is some evidence that adding a lutein supplement to your diet will protect your vision and perhaps improve it. Some reviewers here claim better vision. So far I can't claim that my vision has improved (but I have only been taking Lutein for about a week). The single-compound food supplement market has been growing over the last few years. Chronditin and other joint-preserving compounds have attracted serious fans. In this case, Lutein is definitely needed (as evidenced that it is found in the retina)by the eye. What isn't clear (yet) is whether or not ingesting Lutein actually makes it from the digestive system to the retina.It comes down to personal preference. For the relatively low price of this supplement, I think it is worth investing in something that appears to be helping people maintain and improve their vision. Are they really helped or just enjoying the placebo effect? I don't know. Jarrow is a reputable brand and I trust that I am getting the indicated dosage. I figure it's worth $12 (approx.) a month to try to insure eye health. If you are also inclined to try Lutein, then this product is a very good choice; the dosage is within the range that eye professionals suggest, the company has a good reputation, and the price is reasonable.I'll report back if/when I feel any direct benefits. For now, I have added it to my daily supplements.One Month ReportNo detectable changes in vision. I am going to continue using this for another 3 months. If I can't find any noticeable changes/improvements, I will discontinue. Stay tuned....
B0013OX9NC My son reviewed this product since he has a retinal/visual impairment.  The product was palatable, and easy to take as directed.  He was unable to notice any difference after three weeks in visual acuity or color differentiation.  As with many supplements and even conventional medication, it is difficult to ascertain an alteration in your body's status without objective forms of measurement before and after.It would be ideal to not only trial this product for a minimum of 3 months, but to also be able to perform visual acuity and color perception assessments along the way.
B0013OX9NC Carotenoids are a family of plant pigments found in fruits and vegetables. They are red in color, but some appear pink or yellow.Salmon, lobster, and shrimp contain the carotenoid called astaxanthin. Carotenoids are powerful anti-aging antioxidants, which protect human body cells from free radicals, which disturb the body's molecular structure. Vitamin C, vitamin E, and lipoic acid are network antioxidants.Jarrow Formulas Lutein( in 60 softgels) contains these revolutionary ingredients that will protect your health(and fight body aging). Lutein and zeaxanthin are found in dark, green, leafy vegatables. And in this little bottle. The average American absorbs about 2 mg of lutein per day. Don't be average. Kick up your health trajectory. Jarrow Formulas.
B0013OX9NC The Jarrow name is the reason I ordered this product.  I always know that Jarrow ships only the best and I was not disappointed.
B0013OX9NC I have an aunt with macular degeneration and she was advised to take Lutein so I decided to try this brand which has been around since 1977. Before I buy from a company I always checkout who owns it. So many of the companies these days have been bought by mega corporations. It seems that Jarrow, though incorporated in 1988 is still run by Jarrow L. Rogovin from their base in Los Angeles. Other than that, the company has a message on the bottom of its page that says it supports US/Isreal relations. The Lutein comes in the form of a medium sized orange football shaped softgel which is easy to swallow. I've taken Lutein for some time so I can't attest to this brand being better or worse than others. It contains 20mg of Leutin from Marigold Petal Extract and 1mg of Zeaxanthin from the same source.
B0013OX9NC Supposedly lutein is great for your eyes and is found in eggs.  So if you have cholesterol issues or egg allergies, this is an option.  They are easy to swallow and no noticeable after taste or smell.But I cannot measure if it's working or not (can't do that with eggs either).  So if you need lutein, this is an option.
B0013OX9NC I haven't noticed any improvement in vision thus far.  Also, I have a cataract in my left eye and no improvement there either, and there have been suggestions that Lutein can improve the vision and/or slow the progression of cataracts.Despite this, I know that Jarrow makes an excellent product and the price seems very reasonable.  4 stars based on that.  Should I begin to notice improvement in any way, I'll update this review and share my findings with anyone who might be interested.
B0013OX9NC In my opinion, Jarrow makes the most high quality supplements.  Their Lutein is no different.  Lutein was recommended to me improve my vision, particularly night vision.  I believe this supplement helps with vision and keeps eyes healthy.  This supplement helps prevent macula degeneration and also helps with focus and color differentiation.  Highly recommended.  Excellent product.
B0013OX9NC I have a dry eye problem at night and thought I would try this (as a Vine Reviewer). I've been taking it for a couple weeks, but I haven't notice any difference. I had been using Fish OilNew Chapter Wholemega, 1000 Mg, 180-Countthat my Optometrist recommended, so I will probably go back to that regime along with this stuff.After doing some research on-line, I discovered that the ingredients in this product (Lutein and Zeaxanthin) are compounds called Xanthophylls, which are naturally-occuring yellow pigments (from Marigolds) and are anti-oxidants. Xanthophylls belong to a class of organic compounds called carotenoids. These compounds might reduce your risk for macular degeneration and cataracts. I am concerned about my eye health especially since I work on a computer and do close-up work throughout the day.The dosage is one and it is a very small soft-gel and easy to swallow.
B0013OX9NC My son has recurring anterior uveitis.  Which I have tried to control as holistically as possible.  He takes circumin and quercitin everyday as antiinflammatory compounds. To protect the eye, they suggest carotenoids found in leafy greens.  Well, that goes only so far...it is always a battle.  So we have been supplementing with this pill that helps protect the eye and gives him the carotenoids that I obsess about him getting.His eye has been clear, with the exception of one short flare up, for almost two years.  Yay!  The original diagnosis was pretty grim and a lifetime on crappy steroids scared me for him on so many levels.  I am happy to be controlling it this way.
B0013OX9NC I have been taking this supplement for about a month. I have noticed that my eyes feel stronger and more powerful. I am also supplementing with Beta Carotene. I plan to order more of this &#34;LUTEIN&#34; supplement when this finishes. It appears to me that it is a very effective product!!!
B0013OX9NC I began taking Lutein when I became concerned about my genes...I've never had great ideas but watching my mother slowly and permanently lose her vision is scary and heartbreaking. But that's not to say only those who see their parents in this position need it: After all, my grandparents (my mom's parents) never even needed GLASSES!Simply put, this is insurance for one's eyes, especially in this time when we we are making them do far more work than generations ever before in front of glaring computer screens, e-readers, and far more TV daily.  Who knows what ill effects our generations may see that we have no idea about now as we are the first to enter the digital age?While it's hard to say the improvements on our eyes from a few months of lutein, it does appear that the Jarrow formula has a good quantity and is in pure form, and a good supplement that many doctors say we really should be taking but it's not always found in supplements. (icaps supplements add lutein because of the movement saying we all need it now.)If your vitamin supplement doesn't yet contain lutein, don't forget one of your most important organs as you nourish the rest. I was blind for a year after lasik surgery went wrong, and I can personally tell you living without your eyes is noplace you EVER want to be.  it's affordable insurance against a common issue: eye degeneration.
B0013OX9NC Jarrow's Lutein 20mg I have not noticed anything positive or negative. I am in my 40's and do quite a bit of reading both on the computer and in print. I don't wear glasses and would like to prevent over stressing my eyes and if it helps taking a product like this to try and keep my eyes in good health. However, I can't say one way or the other if this product helps. It isn't hurting or bothered my eyes since I have taken it. It also hasn't created anything adverse to my normal routine or created any unpleasant side effects for me either.
B0013OX9NC My ophthalmologist recommended that I start taking lutein and recommended that I take Preservision. This has 10 more milligrams than Preservision and in the stores is about $20 less a month and is recommended by the staff at Sprouts. Then I found it at Amazon. The price at Sprouts in $19, and I saved almost $13 by having it auto-shipped, and there is no shipping cost. I am very please, especially as it is necessary to my vision that I take this. This pill itself is a gel-tab and is fairly small and easy to take.
B0013OX9NC I take one every other day due to the high dose. Little larger than expected so people with small pathways may not like these. I'm a guy that will toss up to four different pills on my tongue and swallow them all together so I have no problem taking these.
B0013OX9NC These Jarrow Lutein 20mg Softgels are marketed as being good for the eyes and, as I am concerned about my failing vision due to diabetes, decided to give these a try. A little on-line research show strong support for Lutein being good for the eyes and my optometrist sells similar supplements, so feel comfortable taking these in the dosage provided. The pills are not too big and seem to be good quality. The results can take quite awhile to manifest so it is hard to quantify that these are making any difference after two week of taking them, but hopefully they are doing what they are purported to do.Recommended!CFH
B0013OX9NC After reaching my 40's, I had noticed a change in the sharpness of my eyesight.  With a lifetime of up to that point 20/20 vision, it was pretty frustrating.  A friend and fellow herbalist recommend that I started taking Lutien and the Jarrow formulas was just the right number of milligrams that I needed at a very good price.Since taking them, my eyesight seems to be improving, though I am very certain that this is a slow process and will much likely be more pronounced over a longer period of time. So while I still do use a set of reading glasses from time to time, I do notice that it is less often.Jarrow Formulas always seems to put out excellent, very reasonably priced supplements. I have yet to be disappointed in anything that I have gotten from Jarrow through Amazon.
B0013OX9NC I've been taking these for a month now and I can't say I've noticed any difference in my vision, but there have been no side effects either. I really wouldn't expect a noticeable improvement in vision, but would take them to help prevent further degradation. These are easily swallowed, brown, ovoid capsules. I've been happy with all four Jarrow products that I've tried.
B0013OX9NC The more you lose eyesight, the more you appreciate it.  This product is supposed to help the eyes against the damaging effects of the type of UV blue light that strikes the retina.I get fewer floaters at night using Lutein.
B0013OX9NC This is a product I have been taking for about 3 months now.THIS brand is a new one to me but all in all it appears tobe the same product and the price is much lower than my last'brand name'.  I am taking this primarily because my Motherhas taken it for about 1 yr. and had her eyes tested and hervision actually got 2% better.  I have hopes of just protectingmy vision...if my vision gets better that is just a bonus!
B0013OX9NC I have been using the Jarrow Formula Lutein for about 3 weeks, during this time I have gained the ability to see through most substances (except oddly.... lead). I have also gained the ability to shoot heat rays from eyes. The only drawback.... I now have this weakness when exposed kryptonite. Crazy stuff....Ok, so Jarrow Formula Lutein has not given me the ability to see through walls, and the ability to shoot heat rays, but it does seem to have helped 
B0013OX9NC It's hard to review supplements accurately but I can give you a glimpse of my experience plus a little research. I have a delicate stomach so I sometimes get heartburn from supplements, but this one did not seem to cause that. I did not notice a benefit either but that can take a long time to show up.According to WebMD, lutein and zeaxanthin are \"linked to lower risk of macular degeneration and cataracts.\"  These compounds are found in various green vegetables such as spinach. But many of us get concerned about vision problems as we get older, so a supplement seems like good insurance.  A consumer-oriented website gave Jarrow Formulas Lutein an \"approved\" rating. They mention that the dose is one that should be helpful yet the cost is reasonable.The source of the lutein and zeaxanthin in this supplement is marigold petals! Some people are likely to be allergic because marigolds are related to chrysanthemums and ragweed. The product also contain soy, one of the top 10 food allergens. Personally I feel that the top 10 food allergens should never be used in supplements, but I suppose manufacturers like to use cheap ingredients.Proceed with caution.
B0013OX9NC Before taking these I asked my ophthalmologist while I was getting my annual exam if it would be helpful. He cautioned against expecting any improvement in my sight, but said it was not a bad idea for long-term ocular health.After taking them for a couple of weeks I have not experienced any improvement in my sight, but it seems to have helped cut down on the close-focus blurries and strain. Granted, it could just be coincidence or my imagination, but I'm pleased enough with the results that I'm willing to pick up another bottle and continue to use it.Zero side effects from usage. The capsules are somewhat large, but remain easy to swallow since they are the gel-type caps (sort of similar to vitamin E caps). They do have a bit of a musty, early smell when you sniff the bottle, but it does not translate to any negative effects, such as bad breath or gastric problems.Definitely worth trying if you're concerned about eye health.
B0013OX9NC I've been taking this for about 3 weeks now and have doubled up on the dosage.  I was experiencing a lot of bad eye strain effects, and at my age that's bothersome.  Watching way too many late movies and Netflix shows.  Plus a recent subscription to Crunchyroll had me watching more anime than usual.  My right eye has weakened more than my left and I think there is a problem when working both together with eye strain on the left.  It's hard to say because I cut back a bit on the TV, but I've not experienced any blurry vision in the last week, and that's even after a long session with reading anime subtitles.The formula itself seems to be well tolerated.  I take medication for thyroid, edema, and cholesterol, and I didn't notice any effect with any of the medications.  I did not notice any issues with any of my other supplements, although once I did get a slightly upset stomach.  I think it was more that I took this stuff without eating much.  I've been on a juicing diet for about 60 days and occasionally, it will give me some stomach trouble.  This usually goes away eating some steamed broccoli and carrots.  It went away like usual, so I can't blame the supplement.  This seems effective enough that I'll continue it and, maybe buy some if the effect lasts till the end of the bottle, I have about half left.  Recommended, but as with any supplement try and see if it has any effect and it may take a month or two to find out.  Stop immediately if it reacts to you or any medications you're on!
B0013OX9NC My doc recommended this additive to replace Lutein loss. Your eyes have Lutein when you are born, but it isn't reproduced by the body. Lutein filters the ultra violet light that eyes are exposed to. I've been taking this for 5 months and the best way that I can determine if it is working is that my eyes don't seem as light sensitive. I still wear sunglasses when I am outdoors, but the effects of this product is most obvious indoors when the sunglasses are gone.
B0013OX9NC So in my experience, Jarrow is an excellent brand and I have noticed a difference in taking their products (versus other brands).  But I had never taken Lutein before.  I have poor vision made worse by some damage from an eye surgery many years ago, so I thought I'd see if this would help.  There could be more long term effect or maybe I just didn't need this herb, but I didn't notice any effect whatsoever (used 1 full bottle, one pill a day).  If you are interested in Lutein, I would try this brand.
B0013OX9NC I've been trying to take this so I can give an honest review, but it smells like something you'd step in in the barnyard.  It's bad enough getting it down, but then when I burp I smell it all over again.  And, it seems like it makes me burp more often, or maybe I just notice it more because of the stench.  I would have to say it just doesn't agree with me.  I'm still trying to take it, but yuck.  My cousin's doctor recommended this to her because she has macular degeneration and she swears by it.  I wanted to try it because I'm nearing fifty and have noticed that my eyesight is not as good as it used to be.
B0013OX9NC My Mother has a rare form of macular degeneration and has been told to let her family members know so they can be checked for the same disease.  Once checked, the optomerist told me to take lutein for my eye health and I did not have macular degeneration as of now.  This lutein formula is just what I was looking for to keep eyes healthy.  Jarrow Formula Lutein is one of the best on the market and mine came from Amazon.  If you are concerned about your eyes' health please check out this product and I think you will be pleased..Jarrow Formulas Lutein 20mg, 60 Softgels
B0013OX9NC I don't know if it's natural or what but the ones I received kind of smelled and like to stick together.
B0013OX9NC I got this product because  I was concerned with my eyes. I used to go tanning at the salon and I didn't always use the eye protection. And over the past few months I have noticed that when i am driving at night the lights of on coming cars seem ridiculously bright. I bought this product in hopes that it would help my eyes to heal. I have read other reviews on this product and they rave on how awesome it is, so i hope it works for me.
B0013OX9NC This is a good source of lutein and it's liquid, so it absorbs quickly. I always try to avoid tablets for supplements, as your body doesn't assimilate them as well as gels or capsules.I would also suggest anyone who is looking to improve eyesight engage in eating better and exercising. You can do this by eating produces high in lutein (like kale and spinach - organic is much, much better). Get a juicer and mix these with organic carrot and organic apples for maximum benefit and to improve the flavor.For eye exercises, the book Eye Yoga is FANTASTIC.So get your lutein supplement and supplement it with a little extra effort and you'll be happy with the results.
B0013OX9NC I have some health related issues with my eyes so I wanted to see if Lutein made a noticeable difference. I've heard lots of positive things about it. Honestly it's hard after just one bottle with this supplement to tell if it's make a difference. It was easy to take and didn't give me any adverse side effects like some can do.
B0013OX9NC I have no way to actually measure the direct effect this has had on me in the month I've been taking it. Nothing bad at least. What I can say is that, unlike other supplements, this one does not have a funky taste (it actually has no taste at all). The pills are small and easy to swallow. I've read a lot about Lutein, which is why I decided to give it a try. You should definitely do your own research before deciding to take any supplements (and check with your doctor). If you decide to go with Lutein, then this one seems fine to me!
B0013OX9NC I had Lasik surgery about 5 years ago and I try to maintain my vision as best I can.  I have been taking Lutein supplements for a short time and health magazines always recommend it for better vision.  These small pills last 2 months if taken daily and they are the size of a peanut M&M.  They are coated and are easy to swallow.  If you are looking for a Lutein supplement, this is a good buy.  I highly recommend it.
B0013OX9NC The pills are small, about the size of a pea. Or an edamame bean. They are soft and super easy to swallow. No stickiness, no smell, nothing negative. Seen no side-effects, and will wait to see if it helps my eyesight. Right on the 20/40 border for near vision, and my doctor said to try this and lets see (ha ha) what happens. Lutein was found to help prevent eyesight in a study cited by the normally very skeptical Center for Science in the Public Interest, so I've subscribed to this product now.
B0013OX9NC Daverat's Wife speaking (pls be kind RE: Typos; I have arthritis) I'm starting to experience some minor focusing issues that all people usually find they suffer in the mid 30s through their 40s and I also have a concern about Age-Related Macular Degeneration in my family, also known as: AMD.  So, I began looking at Lutein supplements and other \"Vision Vitamins'.  Specifically, I brought this bottle of plain Jarrow Lutein supplement and their jazzier soundingJarrow Formulas Vision Optimizer, 90 Capsulesinto my doctor's office for his opinion.  He's a GP who is quite open to vitamins and food supplements for both treatment and prevention as long as he knows what's in them and can look up any potential problems they might cause.  He cleared me to take this Lutein supplement for prevention without any problems.  I showed him the other bottle and after he put HIS reading glasses on to check the ingredients out in his side effects App on his computer, he began to frown.  Long story short, he told me to toss the other ones and take THIS Jarrow Lutein for AS LONG AS I COULD AFFORD TO since it is a PREVENTATIVE and not a miracle supplement that gives you results in 30 days.  He felt everyone over 35 should adding Preventative doses of Lutein to their supplements.I like Jarrow products for price and simplicity  As long as you CHECK the formulations and ingredients dosages, they can be very effective and economical.  I regularly order theirJarrow Formulas Whey Protein, French Vanilla, 2 Poundwith my monthly Subscribe & Save items.  It's the one of the best Whey Proteins my husband and I have ever used and at such a good price.  Likewise I'm impressed with this Lutein because it contains 20 Mgs of Lutein plus the added ingredient of 1 mg of Zeaxanthin.  My doctor told me that people used to say all you needed was 6 Mgs of Lutein for protection against AMD but that was the bare minimum to see any benefit at all.  He was the one who told me that 20 mgs was the current thinking and that Lutein without any Zeaxanthin is pretty much useless.  Apparently Zeaxanthin is the material that makes up the Macula of your retina and having the 2 together is the best protection.  This Jarrow Lutein has the 1 mg of Zeaxanthin in addition to the 20 Mgs of Lutein.  the two together form 1 preventative supplement to help  prevent the onset of AMD as you get older.Taking a  Daily Lutein and Zeaxanthin supplement is largely a protection against Age-Related Macular Degneration.  I have Aunts who suffer from this and I wanted the protective benefits that taking a daily supplement can provide.  The people rating this based on improved vision seem to misunderstand what the purpose of such a supplement is.  You will NOT LIKELY see short term results.  This is a Supplement you take for THE LONG HAUL from mid life til you die in the hopes that it affords you some significant protection from Macular Degeneration due to age.  Studies have indicated that this dosage and formulation can have a positive effect on your risk but that's it.  Lutein is no magic pill against middle-aged myopia.  You will still need your reading glasses, I'm afraid.I am pleased that the dosage & formulation are correct, the price is economical and there are no added on, unnecessary ingredients with potentional side effects on medications such as other \"pumped up\" vision supplements have.  In fact, the major source of the Lutein in the Jarrow formulation is Marigold Petal Extract, an old herbalists remedy dating back thousands of years.  As far as we were able to see, neither my doctor nor I could find any potential interactions.  Vegans, however, be aware that there is beeswax and gelatin in the softgels.  There is also Soybean oil if that is of a concern to some. I will be adding this to my monthly delivery schedule and I'm so glad Jarrow makes basic supplements in addition to their more \"out there\" supplements for the adventurous self-helpers.Remember, taking your Lutein is like eating your carrots - you may not notice the difference for years to come but hoo-boy you'll be glad you did it one day.
B0013OX9NC This product contains Lutein and Zeaxanthin, two plant pigments that are also present in the human eye. Because of this, research suggests both are helpful in preventing eye problems. Some research also suggests Lutein may be helpful in improving skin health, taken orally, or applied directly. I make a cream out of Lutein (and other pigments like Lycopene) that I apply at night. Just be warned Lutein is a dark red dye, and a little goes a long way when mixed with creams.This is a good Lutein product, with some oil and mixed tocopherols (a form of Vitamin E, included to keep the product fresh). This is the best way to take Lutein, because it needs some fat to be absorbed properly. The price of this product, when discounted, is pretty good.My eyes are pretty good, and I had LASIK surgery ten years ago. Since I have started taking Lutein, my vision seems even crisper, but it is hard to tell if this is Lutein-related, since I take other supplements. I take this product knowing it is helping to prevent future eye problems.Overall, this is a solid product for a good price.
B0013OX9NC I've been using Jarrow products for a long time and have never been disappointed.  This is no exception.  I'm convinced that Lutein helps protect the eyes and vision protection supplements now often include Zeaxanthin.  I've read that the optimum ratio might be 5 to 1.  This product is 20 to 1, so it might be a bit light on the Zeaxanthin.  The price seems to be fair.  You can get similar warehouse brand products for a bit less and you can pay much more for name brand.  I think it's good value and good insurance for your eye sight.
B0013OX9NC Lutein is found in many dark green leafy vegetables such as kale, spinach, turnip greens, and collard greens, etc., and is good for maintaining good vision and prevent macular degeneration.  The macula is a small area of the retina responsible for central vision.  Lutein accumulates more in the peripheral areas of the retina while zeaxanthin accumulates more in the macula region.  Both lutein and zeaxanthin are believed to have anti-oxidative properties and protect the retina/macula from harmful blue light.  My family and I try to maintain a well balanced nutrition but it's helpful to supplement regular leafy green vegetable intake with Lutein supplements.What's good about Jarrow Formulas (JF) Lutein:>Each softgel contains 20mg of lutein (esters) and 1mg of zeaxanthin.>My family's eyes tend to be less strained and our annual eye exams indicate no vision health problems.What's questionable about Lutein supplements in general:>20mg of lutein esters usually yields approx. 10mg of free lutein.  The amount of free lutein absorbed by the retina/macula is unknown.>We've taken the JF brand of 20mg lutein supplements since 2010 and there are no noticeable differences compared to other brands' 20mg geltabs.>There's no DV or Daily (recommended) Value for lutein or zeaxanthin.  Possible side effects of excessive lutein intake.>Each geltab contains mostly soybean oil and the softgel ingredients of gelatin, glycerin, and water.Overall:Taking lutein geltab supplements is helpful but it's more important to maintain a balanced, healthy diet with plenty of leafy green vegetables, wear blue light blocking sunglasses, and don't overstrain one's eyes, etc., to maintain good vision and retinal/macular health.
B0013OX9NC I'm giving it 5 stars because it is a small, very easy to swallow pill. Still not sure if it is permanently useful for my eyes because I've only used it a few weeks but haven't noticed eye strain as much as I used to have when I'm on the computer too long,like 14 hours at a time, so it must be helping with that because I'm not using any other product that helps that. So I could assume Lutein is good and hope that this is working. I'll keep using it and see if it gets rid of all my eye strain problems. Since the Vine program is now requiring a review of every product before you can get more and new ones come out every 3rd Thursday of the month and the next just a week later, I will not have time to try anything for long before the review has to be written. Also will have to write reviews for products as I understand them to work for items that haven't even been delivered before the 4th Thursdays of each month comes out and will just have to update them after they come and I can actually have time to try them.UPDATE: I've been using this for sometime now and NO MORE eye strain. Feels good to be able to watch TV or be on the computer as much as I want and no eye strain and no ruptured blood vessels. I sleep better too because I don't have eye burn when I close my eyes to sleep. Great stuff....
B0013OX9NC I have been using Lutein for years as macular degeneration runs in my family. When I saw the Jarrow formula I was thrilled as I know that Jarrow makes good products. I was not disappointed. The gel was small and easy to swallow, and these pills will be replacing my previous Luteins in my daily vitamin routine.
B0013OX9NC It is common to avoid taking care of your eyes. Since taking Lutein, my eyes feel younger. I can feel the difference.
B0013OX9NC My eye doctor recommended that I use Lutein and I started using these about two weeks ago. I don't see a lot of vision improvement, but am using it more as a preventative for macular degeneration. So far after two years use, no macular degeneration!I really like these particular softgels. They go down easy, don't upset my stomach and seem to be more organic than the last brand that I purchased. I will continue to use these.
B0013OX9NC I've always had exceptional eyesight (20/10), but as I've grown older I've been noticing a decline in my vision. After doing some research I decided to start taking a Lutein supplement. I wanted a supplement that contained at least 20mg of Lutein at a reasonable price. This Jarrow Formulas product fit the bill, so I ordered a bottle. I've got about a week's worth left and I can definitely say my vision has improved. I can't say it's solely from the Lutein because I also quit drinking soda/pop after finding out that Aspartame is bad for eyes. Additionally, I started taking a Bilberry supplement around the same time I began taking this Lutein. Regardless, I know my vision is improving so I will continue to take Lutein and Bilberry supplements. Thanks for reading.
B0013OX9NC My DH has terrible trouble with his eyes getting inflamed, his sight floating so his new glasses don't work that well, and just eye strain in general. He's been to any number of opthamologists and regular doctors, none of whom have been able to tell him what is wrong. All they can recommend is eye drops to keep his eyes from being too dry. I do know his father had macular degeneration, so we're going to try this formula to see if it will help him. The lutein, as I understand it, concentrates in the macula of the eye and helps with focus. The pills themselves are soft and not too large, kind of like a roundish Vitamin E capsule but a little larger, so I hope he'll take them.
B0013OX9NC I figure these would at best help with an ongoing macular issue and at worst do nothing. The seem to have done nothing whatsoever in 2 weeks. The softgels are easy to swallow - not as large as a typical vitamin and that's a good thing. They did not cause any digestive upset or issues - some supplements can have unforseen & unfortunate stomach consequences. However, there was no change any sort noted with regard to actual eye care. Oh well... at least they did no harm.
B0013OX9NC An important thing to know about Lutein is that It is best absorbed with a high fat meal.  If you are taking this and are on a low fat diet, perhaps take this with your Omegas or with some type of healthy fat. Otherwise, you are losing effectiveness of the supplement .  For those not seeing benefits, please try taking them with a high fat meal and see if it makes a difference.My diet is already pretty high in Lutein.  One bottle lasted me for two months.  During the two months that I took the supplement, I did notice an improvement in my vision.  So, although I had an adequate intake of Lutein, the extra oomph did make a difference.I would recommend giving this a try if vision health is a concern.  I learned that I could add a cup of cooked spinach to my diet each day and get the same amount of lutein.  I do think the supplements have value and Jarrow is a company that I trust. I would recommend them.
B0013OX9NC I have been using it for over 7 days...I have noted a better feel to my skin...I do not have bad eyes, but at 47 years old I do note an improvement...well worth the money
B0013OX9NC Easy on the digestive tract and if they help postpone cataract surgery then they are worth it as I am not looking forward to that.
B0013OX9NC The label tells me what it DOESN'T have ie gluten, wheat etc but fails to tell me that the SOYBEAN OIL is GMO! Over 86% of the CORN and SOY in the USA IS a GMO ingredient.  I will no longer buy this product and will search for a NON GMO product.
B0013OX9NC I'll be staying on this product for 1 year.  In the last 4 years I have developed 'floaters' in my eyes and luckily no macular degeneration.  I also had cateracts removed in 2011.I can't say I have noticed any change in vision in the last 2 months but the proof will be when I see my eye doctor in 10 months and she can tell me if my eyes have changed for the worse. If not, I will stay on the product. $60 a year for a chance to safeguard good eye health is worth it.
B0013OX9NC Lutein seems to be one of those supplements that actually has a solid backing of research to back it up.Basically it helps your eyes, and can help some conditions that effect the eyes, such as macular degeneration, cataracts, among others.The 'pill' (gel pack) is quite small, easy to swallow.  If you have eye conditions (or don't want to), this may be an easy decision.
B0013OX9NC What I like about this product mostly, is its affordable price. For someone who has been using mostly Occuvite, and Bausch and Lomb Vision Eye Vitamin, and paying a nice amount of change to keep it going, this product I was hoping, more like praying actually, could be a viable substitute for the more expensive options. I know that in the Lutein department it certainly delivers, but since I am no expert on the subject, I ask myself over and over: \"is this Jarrow Lutein as good as Occuvite, per say?\". The answer is not immediately answered because as we all know, this kind of product must be used with regularity, month after month, in order to accurately decide if its doing what is supposed to do. So, what is the product supposed to do? For one, make my eyes stronger, provide much needed nutrition to avoid serious eye loss, or diseases related to the eyes. Like any part of the body the eyes have to be provided with all the help they need, and Lutein, I keep reading, is quite a healthy boost for their performance.The price in which these soft gels are sold make them very affordable to use month after month. Also the fact that only one a day is the recommended daily use makes a bottle of 60 last two months. Yes! I can see myself being able and happy to provide this much needed nutrient to my eyes, versus more costly options. At the same time I wonder if the more expensive offerings provide a more complete package, sort of speak.Either way, it is highly appreciated that I had the chance to use Jarrow Formulas Lutein, 20mg, 60 count, and I have Amazon to thank for that. It is a great alternative to the higher priced products out there. On the other hand, is very hard to make a determination on just 30 days of using a new product, for we all know it takes regular use to fully appreciate its virtues and setbacks, but those are the rules of the game, and I was expected to render a verdict within 30 days. I could have waited a few more days, but I am sure I will like them the same when the time comes. 60 soft gels for under $10? What is there not to like? Perhaps Jarrow is the one company who thinks about the prize being more affordable, and if that is their mentality of business then I praise them, just as long as their products are as good as they certainly sound. 4 Stars for now.
B0013OX9NC Jarrow Formulas' \"Lutein\" is a dietary suppliment for support of visual function and protection of the macula. The bottle contains 60 softgels which while big can be easily swallowed. There is 20 mg of Lutein and 1 mg of Zeaxanthin in each softgel.Since there is history of eye deterioration I thought this would be a product to try. I have been taking 1 softgel per day as directed on the package for a little over a week now, but it is difficult to almostimpossible to determine the effectiveness of the product. Some doctors prescribe lutein for their senior patients, others say that it will not harm or help your eyes. I have taken other brands of lutein in the past without any side effects. I have found that even with taking this \"Lutein\" with food as directed on the package that about an hour or 2 hours after taking the softgel I experience some stomach and/or lower G.I pain which last several hours. It is not severe pain but is discomforting. Perhaps it is a coincidental that I take the softgel and then experience pain but it has been 9 days in a row. I don't think I have ever had zeaxanthin in the other lutein I have taken and wonder if that may be the cause of the discomfort.
B0013OX9NC Love all the Jarrow vitamin supplements. Jarrow has done it again with the amazing Lutein formula for increased eye support. My 80+ father in law who had macular degeneration swears by this.
B0013OX9NC I've reached that age where it seems every printed page is getting smaller, every attempt to focus my eyes requires concentration and a few seconds, and every morning and night is a new experiment in decreasing degrees of visual acuity, which is to say, I need reading glasses more and more and I'm about to give up entirely on trying to focus on anything less than three feet away whenever I am tired (early in the morning or late at night). I mentioned this problem to a gentleman even older than I am, and he recommended a vitamin that contained lutein. Since I already take a regular multivitamin, I figured adding lutein to my current regimen might help me out just as well.What I have read about lutein is that it will not help you regain visual ability or better focus or anything like that. What it will do is prevent your macula and lens from experiencing as much of the degeneration that comes naturally with aging (maybe). The good news is, these soft gels are relatively small, about the size of a 400 i.u. vitamin E, and just as easy to take. The bad news is, well, there is no bad news other than, I cannot tell if these are helping my eyes are not. I'm prepared to say that I will err on the side of caution and maybe take this product on a regular basis if I feel my eyes are getting \"worser and worser\" than they would normally, but short of that, I don't think this is something I need to take on regular basis. At least, I can't see (sorry) taking it every day just yet.
B0013OX9NC About five years ago, I found that I needed to start using glasses for reading.  Recently someone recommended this product to help decrease my reliance on the glasses, and I have to say that so far it seems to work.  Don't get me wrong!  I haven't been able to toss out my glasses, but the fact is that my mid range and distance vision have both improved a bit since I started taking Jarrow's Lutien tablets.  I've been using two tablets a day, and where I've noticed the most improvement is in seeing with dim light.  In a dark room, before the lutien, I had difficulty reading my watch without glasses on - since beginning to take the Jarrow product, I find I can read it without the extra lenses.  Not a miracle cure by any means, but its good to have a product which produces such easily measurable results!The tablets are easy to swallow, and so far I haven't seen any notable side effects beyond the vision improvements.
B0013OX9NC I just turned 48 years young a few days ago and I have enjoyed many years of good vision.  However, I just started using reading glasses prescribed by my doctor with just the faintest magnification.  I have only been taking these a month, but many studies (and my doctor) recommend adding this supplement to your daily routine.  The Jarrow brand is one that I trust and these are easy to take.  I will be continuing to order these from Amazon.
B0013OX9NC Jarrow Formulas Lutein 20mg, 60 softgels is an excellent product.They are very easy to swallow and if you are over fifty I think you should try them,They really help aging eyes. My husband had an eye problem a few months ago when he saw the eye doctor he said it could be the start of a detached retina. Taking lutein has really improved his condition. I take it as a preventative. A bottle lasts us a month. I will not stop taking it. I would recommend you try it.
B0013OX9NC Don't let anybody tell you that they can see just as well at 70 as they did at 30. It's a smoke screen. Everybody's sight begins to diminish with age. If I can get something into my system to assist in staving off the detrimental effects of age, I'm going for it. Jarrow Lutein is specially formulated to aid vision and comes in easy-to-swallow softgels. It gives me a feeling of insurance against macular degeneration, and I'm sure it helps. Anything you can do for your eyes is a good thing.
B0013OX9NC For those with a Lutein deficiency, this is a pricey, but useful product. I wouldn't buy it unless you're convinced that you need this supplement. Eat lots of veggies instead. :)
B0013OX9NC I've been taking Lutein supplements for a couple of decades with the hope it would prevent or delay cataracts - but it appears that strategy didn't work. I am in the mid phase of cataracts anyway - age 69. According to one web site, researchers found that Lutein and Zeaxanthin reduce the probability of cataracts by about 19% for men and 22% for women, which I agree is statistically significant.  However, 19% certainly isn't anywhere close to 100%. It appears I am in the 81% category. Maybe it would have been worse or occurred earlier if I had not taken Lutein all these years. The minimum amount of Lutein necessary for good results is cited to be 6 to 10 mg per day. So 20 mg in this product should be more than minimally sufficient.
B0013OX9NC There's 20 mg of Lutein per capsule, which is more than most of the eye-oriented multivitamins on the market. Doing some research on Lutein, it is naturally found in many greens such as kale, collard, and spinach. There's no conclusive data that indicates a lutein supplement/diet would help reduce macular degeneration or prevent it, and there's no data that indicates the supplement would actually improve your vision. Preventing blue light from damaging the eye is definitely important, and that is why we have sunglasses and special optics that filter out harmful UV A/B/C radiation.I haven't noticed any side effects from taking the Jarrow lutein supplement, but I also haven't noticed any significant improvement in my vision. I did note that it contains twice the dosage per capsule of Lutein versus the Bausch and Lomb Ocuvite brand supplement.Overall: 5/5 stars
B0013OX9NC There haven't been a huge number of authoritative studies on lutein supplementation, so it's hard to know whether the benefits outweigh the risks. A quick internet search turned up one study showing that by the end of 12 months, people suffering from age-related macular degeneration who were given lutein showed vision improvement, while the placebo group did not.The Harvard School of Public Health also published a study on the benefits of dietary lutein and zeaxanthin on cataracts for men and women ages 45 to 75. They found that people who had the largest dietary intake of foods containing these carotenoids have about a 20% lower risk of developing cataracts than the people who had the lowest dietary intake.However, though these carotenoids are probably beneficial for the eyes, they are not without risks. In a study conducted by the National Eye Institute over a six-year period, researchers found that beta-carotene, another carotenoid, increased the risk of lung cancer in smokers. This raises enough of a concern  about carotenoids in general that I personally would avoid taking lutein in supplement format unless I had a very specific reason to do so, and was testing my vision to check to see whether or not I had reached those benchmarks.Now, about these pills specifically: when you open the bottle, it smells really disgusting. To me personally, it smells like old shrimp, but my partner thought it smelled like old cleaning supplies stored in a cabinet in the garage. In any case, poor reviews all around on the smell. Unfortunately, when I broke open the pills, they taste exactly like they smell. I'd recommend taking the pills prior to a meal, so that you don't burp up any of that odor.When I broke the pills open, I found that it was a clear gelcap housing a thick, pasty orange oil which stained my hands yellow. If you want to take lutein in and oil form, this is a good bet. The primary ingredient is marigold petals, which you may not know is used to color the egg yolks of commercially raised chickens so that consumers are fooled into thinking the chickens have a healthier diet than they do. The gel caps themselves are smaller than the average vitamin pill.
B0013OX9NC This formula of Lutein is exactly what my opthamologist recommended I take for vision support - one a day is plenty, too, which makes this a two month supply if taken daily, but I was told three days a week, or every other day was enough, so I do the every other day.
B0013OX9NC It's hard to evaluate supplements, but at least I can say I have not experienced any ill effects :)I'll report back after a couple more weeks. The pills are easy to take.
B0013OX9NC Safe and effective luctein supplement for those who need it.  The pill is small and easy to swallow as well.  There is a lot of research to suggest these have a lot of benefits for eye health especially.  Jarrow always puts out quality products.  Never once had any issue with their supplements.
B0013OX9NC I am taking Lutein to prevent macular degeneration as it has hit members of my family. So since I am taking it in a preventative capacity, it is hard to tell if it works. But this is cheaper than the Lutein than the grocery store brand. I have really liked Jarrow's products and would not hesitate to recommend them. These pills are easy to swallow and don't have any after taste. They did not upset my stomach.Lutein is important to preserve and protect vision and this is a high quality low cost way to get it.
B0013OX9NC I take a series of supplements as part of my diet and I've recently started to take this lutein for my eyesight. The pill is not too large and easy to swallow. You may not be able to stop macular degeneration from hitting you, but these supplements suppossedly help eye health and I'm willing to try them out. These softgels contain nearly the same ingredients that other eye health supplements have. I have felt no side effects since starting to take these and hopefully they are protecting my eyes!
B0013OX9NC I know many people swear by Lutein, but it has done nothing for my vision that I actually notice. Everyone's different I guess.
B0013OX9NC I started taking Lutein after doing some research into some intermittent eye problems I was having. I noticed an improvement within several weeks, continuing through to a few months.  I have also recommended this to a family member who has macular degeneration.  I'm not sure how well this works on simply \"aging eyes\" but there is growing positive research on the effects on degenerative conditions.  I would even say that my night vision has improved.  As for the basics, I found these capsules easy to swallow, with no gastric upset or noticeable ill effects. I also have a good opinion about Jarrow in general, so I was happy to find this product at a relatively good price and with the subscribe and save option and additional discount.
B0013OX9NC Lutein is something of a wonder product for your eyes and believed to help decelerate horrific age-related disorders such as macular degeneration. I've always had a bad eyesight and after a health scare a couple of years ago I've been very careful about what I eat. There are a range of studies showing the benefits of lutein and although you can find it in dark leafy vegetables, eating spinach and kale every day can get tedious. These tablets are a reasonable alternative and although you won't notice any benefits immediately, I've noticed that when combined with diet there is a gradual but noticeable difference. The soft gels are easy to swallow and incorporate into any morning routine.As an aside, if you want to look after your eyes, you can't go wrong with a daily dose of kale, spinach, carrots and broccoli - the combination seems to eliminate floaters and improve general eye health. Although my experience is only anecdotal, I'd highly recommend increasing your lutein intake if you're having any sorts of eye health issues.
B0013OX9NC I have taken other Jarrow vitamins, and I find them to actually contain the amount they say they contain (unlike some other brands), so I am confident that these Jarrow Lutein softgels have the Lutein they claim to have. If you are looking for a lutein supplement, the Jarrow brand is a brand you can trust at an affordable price.
B0013OX9NC I've had my glasses since fourth grade, I'm 33 now, and every year my vision gets a little bit worse. My optometrist told me at some point I will have to take pressure drops daily for my eyes as they decline worse with each visit, and I dread getting glaucoma or going blind some day, it's one of my biggest fears as it's a realistic one and I simply love to read and write and watch movies and want to watch my kids grow up. I get twitches in my eyes sometimes and some of the meds I'm on make my vision blurry at times. Enter this supplement, I've been taking it daily and it's been helping a lot, counter acting the blurry vision from my side effects and also I haven't experienced any eye twitching lately, which is great and surprising to me as it's been happening for years. Highly recommended! I'm going to continue using these even after my sample vitamins are gone, hopefully they will keep my eyes healthy for years to come.
B0013OX9NC I am not sure if it is the lutein rather than placebo effect or a combination of the two. I am highly suggestible. In the last ten days since I started taking these daily I have been enrolled in an online seminar intensive and having to spend 10-12 hours a day online looking at screens and reading reading reading.Usually in such a situation my eyes would be killing me but I have not had much discomfort beyond some dryness. I think they are helping. I have not noticed any increased clarity or color perception.I am dead frightened of macular degeneration and I am taking these prophylacticly for that.Web MD says it may be effective for preventing macular degeneration but the only thing is is effective for, for sure, is lutein deficiency... ha!Here is a short quote from that site so you can get some idea as to your relative danger of lutein deficiency:\"Lutein is called a carotenoid vitamin. It is related to beta-carotene and vitamin A. Foods rich in lutein include broccoli, spinach, kale, corn, orange pepper, kiwi fruit, grapes, orange juice, zucchini, and squash. Lutein is absorbed best when it is taken with a high-fat meal.\"Here is the link to the site in case you want to read further. [...]
B0013OX9NC Haven't quite finished 1st bottle and not sure if I've really noticed much difference - will know more once in finish the 2nd bottle.  No complaints at all.
B0013OX9NC I will definitely be ordering Jarrow Formulas Lutein again. As a woman of \"a certain age,\" I have been becoming aware of subtle changes of my vision. I decided to take lutein because of stories I've read in the news, and this product more than filled the bill. My eyes have become dry and irritated. Of course, there are multiple reasons for this to begin, however, noticing a decline in that irritation coincides with my beginning to take this product. Of course, I have no scientific evidence to offer, however, I know what I feel -- and I do feel better. Recommended!
B0013OX9NC Lutein is vitamin good for the eyes, this Jarrow vitaimin is extracted from marigold pedals, laong w/ soybean oil, beeswax and  mixed tocopherols.The softgel consists of  gelatin, glycerinm, nad waterThe recommended dosage is one soft gel per day.
B0013OX9NC My spouse has a degenerative eye disease and was prescribed supplements to help slow down the formation of secondary cataracts as well as assist in general eye health. Of course, like many physicians, he has his own line of supplement products for sale that tend to cost a fortune.However, unlike many physicians pushing supplements, he also provides the full follow-up testing to show whether or not it was actually working...and it was as evidence by the amount of plaque build-up and impact on the lens. So far so good. Of course, the cost still left a lot to be desired.When this came up for review, we opted to give it a try as it contains many of the same active ingredients in roughly the same doses. The Lutein combined with other eye enhancing supplements all in one formula for about 1/4 the cost of what was being prescribed in-house. Now, the physician formula contained other vitamins etc but many were of an inferior quality; for example, B12 in the form of cyanocobalmin rather than the better absorbed and higher quality methylcobalmin. Given the need for B12 in the eye, this was a serious consideration for us; why spend money on something that is inferior. So, we've opted to duplicate the primary substances in the physician formula with better quality supplements available online. This provide a critical piece of the puzzle and have noticed NO difference whatsoever in outcome.It does require taking a few more pills but 
B0013OX9NC I have been a fan of Jarrow Formulas Lutein for the past month. I'm in my late 30s and very near sighted.  I discovered that my eyes were not focusing correctly on objects or books at close distance.  Imagine my horror and surprise!  Of course, I knew these focussing issues were a sign of getting older, and I didn't want to just give into that truth so quickly. That is, I thought I may as well try to help my eyes out.  So I ordered Jarrow's Lutein, 20mg.  In addition, I also started a course of Bilberry supplements. I take one pill of each at dinner time.  So it's been about a month since my freak out moment of aging and my start on Lutein.  Honestly, my issues with focussing on close objects have lessened. I will continue taking Lutein, since I do think it's helping. And with the Bilberry supplement, I think I might be able to stave off bifocal lenses for a few more years.  Of course, all of my good results could just be the placebo effect, but I value my eyesight, and so I'll take it if it is. I think for the price you are paying for Jarrow Lutein, it's quite a value. Always be sure to talk to your PCP about your supplements regimen.
B0013OX9NC I'm approaching seventy years old, which is about the age that both my mom and her brother began to go blind from macular degeneration. Also, extreme nearsightedness runs in both of my parents' families, which explains why my eyesight has never been better than 20/450. I'm also diabetic (type 2, controlled), and to top it off, I'm only a year or so away from needing cataract surgery. So I take care of my eyes and see my ophthalmologist every year. Since I don't eat very much green, leafy vegetables or eggs - two natural sources of lutein and zeaxanthin - I asked my ophthalmologist about taking supplemental lutein/zeaxanthin at my most recent eye exam. He was fairly noncommittal, but he didn't reject the idea either, so I started taking an older men's multivitamin. The vitamin has only 250mcg of lutein, however, so I started looking for more potent sources. I've read a good bit on the subject, and the Jarrow formula with 20mg dosage is in line with recommendations that I've seen. The instructions on the bottle recommend taking one softgel per day with food, and that's the amount that I'm taking. I've also read that the only known side effect of excess lutein consumption is a harmless bronzing of the skin known as carotenaemia.I haven't taken the Jarrow lutein long enough to notice any obvious benefits, but I've used other Jarrow products enough to trust the brand. Being at great risk of macular degeneration and eventual blindness is a big motivator, and I feel more confident now that I'm taking the lutein/zeaxanthin supplement.
B0013OX9NC Lutein and Zeaxanthin are carotenoid antioxidants that are known to help protect the eyes against oxidative stress, thus helping prevent macular degeneration and other vision problems. These compounds are found to concentrate in the eyes as well as skin, breast, and cervical tissues. These compounds are normally obtained in the diet through green leafy vegetables, which most people don't consume much of. For supplements, marigold petal extract is used to get the concentrated doses of these antioxidants. Jarrow's softgels include soybean oil, beeswax, and mixed tocopherols inside the capsule of gelatin, glycerin, and water. The drawback here is that this isn't suitable for those seeking to avoid soy and the gelatin capsule makes it unsuitable for strict vegetarians. A vegetable-based capsule would make this vegan friendly, and I don't see why Jarrow doesn't implement that since they do have a good number of supplements that are suitable for vegans. I find this supplement to be a valuable one and the softgels are easy to consume, though I prefer to break it open to ingest what is inside without swallowing the gelatin. I'm next going to try Jarrow's Vision Optimizer formula and see if that is better - that one uses regular capsules with a variety of antioxidants and herbal compounds (Lutein and Zeanxathin plus much more) without any soybean oil.
B0013OX9NC Supplements are tricky. They are not regulated like traditional drugs and can make all sorts of claims. Take Lutein for example. It is supposed to be important for eye health and result in improved vision. But is this truly the case? And then there is the matter of psychosomatics. You think that the supplement has improved things when, in reality, it may be just your perception that things have improved. Sometimes it is our imagination that, in itself, caused the improvement. Please keep this in mind as you read my review of Jarrow Formulas Lutein.Having offered my disclosure, I can now say that I noticed an immediate improvement in my eyesight after taking Jarrow Formulas Lutein 20 mg. Not eventually, not over time, not after-a-while. Immediately.Things were fuzzy in the morning for me. I had trouble reading small fonts when I first awoke. It took my eyes several minutes, perhaps a half hour, before the haze passed out of my eyes. That was before taking Jarrow Formulas Lutein. Now I see clearly as soon as I awake.This is a truly amazing result from taking any supplement. Is it real or is it Memorex? I can't say. The improvement was rather dramatic and rather fast. I will leave it up to you to decide if this is a figment of my imagination or a real improvement due to taking Jarrow Formulas Lutein. All I can say is that the improvement was noticeable and real to me. Of course, your results may vary.
B0013OX9NC LUTEINI received my Jarrow Formulas Lutein from the Amazon Vine Program. I spend the better part of a day staring at a computer screen topped off with reading in the evening. Recently I noticed that when I would look up I wasn't able to see clearly. Also, I found that reading small type was impossible with out assistance. It was as though my field of vision was pixelating. I do wear glasses as I have astigmatism in both eyes, but even my glasses were not helping.When I saw Jarrow Formulas Lutein, I wanted to give it a try. The soft gels are football shaped and go down easily. There is no unpleasant after taste. With 60 softgels a bottle, I feel it's a good value.At first I didn't notice any change at all. In the meantime, I shifted to less computer time. After only a few weeks, my eyes do not fatigue as easily, and I can read the small type on this bottles label without much effort. If you suffer from eyestrain you may want to check into this product. I certainly appreciate the difference it made for me.
B0013OX9NC Lutein and Zeaxanthin are tiny but powerful anti-oxidants derived from the petals of marigold flowers. We have taken supplements containing these anti-oxidants over the years - my vision is sharper and more in focus today than it was in my youth.  Jarrow Formulas provides a good quality product in an easy to swallow pill in an economical formula - that's a winner in my book.Serving Size: 1 softgel daily, with food.Lutein 20mgZeaxanthin 1mgOther Ingredients: soybean oil, beeswax, mixed tocopherols (natural preservative)Softgel consists of gelatin, glycerin, water.No wheat, no gluten, no dairy, no egg, no fish/shellfish, no peanuts/tree nuts.
B0013OX9NC Do you appreciate your eyes?  Do you want to keep them healthy and maintain good vision for life?What are your options?Eat Kale every day.  Try it, you'll like it. eheheh.  It only takes about 3 hours to steam a big pot until its tender enough to eat.  Add 3 oz. of olive oil and some Season All and it's not all that bad.Take Ocuvite.  It's an expensive supplement for eye health made by Bausch & Lomb.  Check out the vitamin formulation of mainly Lutein & Zeaxanthin.I like spending less time and money and achieving the same results.Most health conscious folks take multi-vitamins and consume foods and supplements rich in Omega 3, antioxidants and perhaps A, C, E and Zinc along with soluble B vitamins.If you are so inclined, all that's necessary is to add a Lutein supplement.  Many companies sell Lutein supplements.I am not a scientist with a complete lab so I have to find a brand at a reasonable price that I trust and hope that it is not made in China and filled with lead paint.For now, I trust Jarrow Formulas, at least until I discover a reason not to.
B0013OX9NC I've taken other lutein supplements, but Jarrow Formulas is more reasonably priced than most.  The pills go down easy and contain 20mg of lutein each vs. 10-40mg for other supplements.  I honestly can't say how well it works, but supposedly it's effective in maintaining healthy eyes.  Leafy greens like kale and spinach are high in lutein.  I think you'd have to eat about half a pound of spinach to get 20mg of lutein though.
B0013OX9NC I've never taken supplements before except for occasional multi-vitamins and am not a fan of them in general, preferring instead to simply eat a healthy diet.  But as a voracious reader, I had lately noticed my eyes feeling tired and decided to give this product a try.Lutein is a chemical which is concentrated in the area of the retina which is responsible for our vision.  Some studies have shown that lutein supplementation increases the pigmentation in the macula, and may help decrease the risk of age-related eye diseases such as macular degeneration and cataracts.  Most research studies have been associated with the elderly and not supplementation among the general population, but there also do not seem to be any harmful side effects to taking it.  (The only side effect I could find to taking too much was possible bronzing of the skin, but that's probably something I could use after a long winter and with an upcoming vacation at the beach!)Lutein is found naturally in leafy green vegetables such as spinach and kale as well as the yolks of eggs, and although we generally eat pretty healthy at our house I'd have to admit it could be a little better sometimes.  The Jarrow softgels, which are just over half an inch long, get their lutein from an extract from marigold petals (one of my favorite flowers) and contain 20mg.  Other ingredients are \"soybean oil, beeswax and mixed tocopherols.\"  The recommendation is for one a day and they seemed to go better when taken with a meal.  I hesitate to mention it but it did seem my eyes felt a little less tired when I started taking these, although I honestly may have only imagined it.
B0013OX9NC I started taking \"eye vitamins\" when my mother's sight began fading due to age-related macular degeneration (abbreviated AREDS).  The key ingredient I look for is lutein.  Unfortunately, the typical eye vitamin is sized like a horse pill, and I have trouble swallowing big pills.  These are not only sized smaller, they are softgels, which means they go down easy!  I am glad I found these.
B0013OX9NC I intend to enjoy active health and my physical senses well into my later years. So I take a lot of supplements (with my doctor's okay), in recommended dosages. Lutein is one for the eyeballs. It is purported to protect vision in the macula and lens.Recommended daily amount is one softgel per day with food. The source for this pill is marigold petals, and there is 20 mg of lutein per serving. There is also Vitamin E as an oil-based carrier, which is nice.
B0013OX9NC Each serving Jarrow Lutein combines 20 mg. lutein with 1 mg. zeacanthin. In a 2007 article in JAMA (Journal of the American Medical Associatoin) Opthamology, Dr. John Paul SanGiovanni of the National Eye Institute, Maryland and colleagues discuss a six-year study that led to the conclusion that \"Study participants reporting the highest dietary intake of lutein/zeaxanthin were statistically less likely to have advanced AMD\" (Age-related Macular Degeneration, which basically means age-related blindness). In a Q&A; on AMD, Dr. Burt Dubow of Insight Eye Care in St. Cloud. MN says, \"There are eye supplements available that contain the essential elements found in dark green leafy vegetables -- primarily lutein and zeaxanthin. Taking these supplements as directed may help forestall the effects of macular degeneration.\"This is one of a number of supplements I take in hopes it will do me some good without expecting undeniable immediate effects (like when I take melatonin or valerian, for example). I get a tiny amount of lutein but no zeaxanthin in the daily \"adults 50+\" vitamin I take, so I think/hope I do well for my eyes by taking Jarrow Lutein.Jarrow Formulas is held in high regard in the natural food industry. Jarrow has won many awards from a number of journals and magazines geared toward natural food, nutrition and vitamin industry insiders. Based on my experience in the industry (I operated natural food co-ops and for-profit stores from the mid-70's into the early 90's) and my familiarity with Jarrow brand supplements (I've used and continue to use quite a few), I rank Jarrow highly among supplement brands in terms of quality and fair pricing.
B0013OX9NC Marketed to promoted eye health , Lutein softgels claim to promote macula health. My mother suffers from degradation of the macula , and this product was recommende by her eye doctor.The effects and impact won't be known for a while , but hopefully this product will stave off the deteriorization for a while.
B0013OX9NC How important is ones eyesight?  About as important as it can be!  I want my eyes to be as healthy as I can make them. Lutein helps to keep the eye healthy.  I was happy that the Amazon Vine Program had  Lutein as an option.  I will continue to buy Jarrow Lutein to help keep my eyes healthy.
B0013OX9NC On the advice of my ophthalmologist I have been using 20 mg of Lutein daily for about four years now.  This product is recommended for macula and lens health.  The bottle contains a 60 day supply of the softgel, easy to swallow capsules.  The ingredient list is:  Lutein (as esters) 20 mg, Zeaxanthin (as esters) 1 mg, soybean oil, beeswax and mixed tocopherols.  Softgel consists of gelatin, glycerin and water.  The label also notes there is no:  wheat, gluten, dairy, eggs, fish/shellfish, peanuts/tree nuts.  Notice that this product does contain soy.The only reason for the rating of four stars over five is because the product I've been using for many years does not include the soy.  Other than that the two brands appear identical.  On the other hand, the price for this product is quite a bit less than the one I'm using now.  When this 60 day supply is about to run out I will have to decide which factor will carry the most weight for re-ordering.
B0013OX9NC Many multivitamins have lutein, but I'd like to be sure I'm getting enough of this nutrient, which is believed to contribute to eye health. We have all kinds of eye issues in our family, and I'd love to avoid getting them. I have one minor issue, and will update the review after using this supplement after a while, after my next eye exam. Meanwhile, this is an easy-to-swallow softgel caplet with 20mgs of lutein per cap.
B0013OX9NC These Lutein pills literally smell like horse manure. The size of the pill is small but I have not been able to get past the smell to regularly take it. I am not a great pill taker and easily gag. Per other reviews they do seem to work.
B0013OX9NC Lutein is one of the most essential nutrients for eye health, especially as we get older. A carotenoid, it works as an antioxidant in the retina by scavenging the free radicals produced by blue light. most of us probably don't get enough lutein in our diet, so the Jarrow Formulas version is a great supplement at a great price.I've been using this product daily for over a month. I'm not really sure if I can tell that it's protecting my vision. I do honestly think that it has been helping with my night vision when I biking, but I have no way to prove that. Hopefully it'll keep improving.
B0013OX9NC My ophthalmologist recommended lutein years ago when I developed a macular problem. Although I have never taken the Jarrow lutein, I have taken others as a supplement. I find theJarrow Formulas Lutein 20mg, 60 Softgelsto be an easy to swallow capsule with no aftertaste and it is available at a reasonable price. I will continue to purchase. The only negative for me is the gelatin capsule, but I'm willing to swallow that minor complaint for the benefits.
B0013OX9NC Lutein is an important pigment (carotenoid) that is important for visual health. There are studies showing that it is important to lower the risk of cataracts and age related macular degeneration.This supplement contains both lutein and zeaxanthin, a related antioxidant.Each capsule contains 20mg of lutein and 1mg of zeaxanthin from marigold. The capsules are small and easy to swallow. To those who can't get enough lutein and zeaxanthin from dietary sources or merely need more, this is a good supplement. I like the Jarrow brand and it's sold at a good price, therefore I highly recommend this.
B0013OX9NC This is a high quality Lutein supplement for a company I trust. I would highly recommend it for anyone who takes Lutein.
B0013OX9NC Don't we all want to be healthy?  Shouldn't we want to have products available to help us maintain or improve our health?  That is what we have here.
B0013OX9NC I have to admit I had never heard of Lutein before receiving this.  That wouldn't surprise many I suppose, but I am someone that is a strong believer in healthy supplements keeping us feeling better, and keeping the doctor away much better than the proverbial apple.  But I am so glad I decided to try it, for it has helped greatly with an odd problem I had with focusing my eyes in the morning.  I work from home and stay up very late.  An early riser and greeter of the sparkling dawn I am not.  Waking up late especially over the last 6 months has seen me having this odd, focusing problem where for the first half hour or so I seem to have a blurry type of double vision.  Very subtle and not all that alarming but definitely there.  A look online at the symptom just leaves one scared to death of it possibly being a brain tumor or diabetes.  But this is not something that lasts long or fits the various other symptoms of those frightening categories at all. It always clears up after a short time and doesn't return until the next morning. (The closet I came to it being something benign is dryness of the eyes after a nights sleep.  Eye drops upon awakening helped, but not all that much)...Enter Lutein, something I came across with excellent reviews that I decided to try, feeling I had nothing to lose anyway...  Well it has been about two weeks taking this now and I already have seen a very noticeable improvement in my morning vision.  I can't really find any info online that backs up my theory that this supplement is totally responsible for the success.  But I can tell you that since starting to take this once a day I have not changed my bedtime, continued the eye drops, or done anything else that would justify my morning vision seeing such an improvement.  And the problem really has gotten much better.  In fact it has gotten too where I don't remember every morning, or are really taking much notice of my focus being blurry upon awakening now since it has all but disappeared.  As for the brand, Jarrow products are one that I am no stranger too and take other of their supplements already.  They are always delivered fresh, quickly, and are reasonably priced.  I know this Lutein is advertised as protecting the macula and makes no mention of my particular problem.  But the many favorable reviews on this stuff does add convincing testimony to Lutein being very effective for a number of vision problems.  All I know is I am one of them now, and I highly recommend Jarrow's Lutein... : )
B0013OX9NC Jarrow Formulas Lutein (20mg) is a duo of Lutein from marigold petal extract and Zeaxanthin, also from marigold petal extract.  Though Lutein and Zeaxanthin are considered minor carotenoids, they provide benefits beyond beta-carotene.  Specifically, they \"support visual function and to protect the health of eye tissues as we age.\"  Like many supplements, there is overlapping benefit in the form of potential cardiovascular support.I took this supplement for 30 days.  Overall, I did notice some benefit to my vision but it is hard to describe.  I guess the closest thing would be \"everything seems clearer.\"  I did not notice any change in eye moisture - my eyes are still generally kind of dry, but that is mostly because I stare at a computer screen all day without blinking as much as I should.  At any rate, this looks like one of those supplements that I will continue to take / add to my daily regimen.  I currently use several Jarrow Formulas supplements and I have had consistently good results with them.  I consider them a trusted brand.
B0013OX9NC Some year back I had a scare when during a routine eye exam for glasses, my optometrist said that he saw evidence that I may be going through the onset of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). He suggested a second opinion from another specialist, so I did it immediately. The second OD did an extensive in-depth exam, and said that it was not conclusive, but among the things that he suggested was that I start taking lutein on a daily basis. I followed his advice.ThisJarrow Formulas Lutein 20mg, 60 Softgelscontains 20 mg lutein and 1 mg zeaxanthin, which is a bit more potent than the Ocuvite Eye Vitamin & Mineral Supplement that I've been taking (with 6 mg lutein and 150 mg of omega-3), and is a bit more cost effective, especially since I'm already taking omega-3 on a daily basis. The small amount of zeaxanthin in the Jarrow Formulas product is found naturally in foods such as spinach, romaine lettuce, broccoli, zucchini, and various greens, and is said to help a bit with AMD, especially with those exposed to heavy smokers.Macular degeneration is nothing to mess with, especially for one who photography is an important part of my life. At the time of my initial inconclusive diagnosis, I was a smoker, and the fear of AMD made me quit.There are enough studies and clinical trials out there that have shown that there's evidence of a relationship between low plasma concentrations of lutein and zeaxanthin, and an increased risk of developing age-related macular degeneration. Some of these studies support the view that supplemental lutein and/or zeaxanthin will help protect against AMD, and that's enough for me.So does this product work? Have I seen any miraculous changes in my vision? No I have not, but I use it for maintenance, and since I quit smoking a few years ago, the combination may be why my eye health has not degraded. The small softgels are easy to swallow, and I like the idea that this is in a stronger concentration than the original that I was taking at the suggestion of my optometrist.On a personal basis, I can only suggest that you discuss it with your eye care professional first, as your results may vary.TheJarrow Formulas Lutein 20mgis a cost-effective product in a softgel form. At the one per day suggested dosage, you have a two month supply compounded to replenish the vital nutrients your eyes can lose as you age. It's a good way to help with proper retinal function and supp
B0013OX9NC Lutein is a substance found in many vegetables, but especially leafy ones like spinach and kale. It's known for its contribution to eye health, since it can be found as a pigment in the human eye. It is believed to act as a light filter, protecting the eye from damage. However, lutein has also been linked (less conclusively) to cancer and heart disease prevention.While lutein is typically found in multivitamins these days, the amount is often very small. Fortunately, Jarrow Formulas provides a larger source of lutein, at 20mg (from marigold petal extract). This is the amount consumed in the diets of some non-American population groups. The formula also includes 1mg of zeaxanthin, which is similar in structure and function to lutein.Jarrow Formulas has a good reputation and adheres to the FDA's Good Manufacturing Practices. Since supplements are unregulated, it's good to know that Jarrow takes the quality and potency of its supplements very seriously. I feel confident I'm getting what is on the label of the bottle.The pills are peanut sized softgels that are easy to swallow. In addition, the price is very reasonable. Since lutein is fat soluble, the recommendation of one softgel a day may be a little unnecessary. One every two to three days would be more economical. But, since it dissolves in fat, it's important to take with food.Overall, I'm impressed by Jarrow's lutein formula. I take a lot of supplements daily (including other lutein formulas) and am very impressed by the quality of the product.
B0013OX9NC Jarrow Formulas Lutein soft gels are a necessary supplement for your eyes.  I really enjoy Jarrow Formulas products and this one is no exception.  The lutein comes in easy-to-swallow soft gels.  Be sure to take them with a small glass of water because dry swallowing them will give back a funny after taste.  I am starting to feel the effects of lutein after taking them for a couple of weeks.  If you are looking for a lutein supplement for your daily help then you'll want to pick up a bottle today.
B0013OX9NC Jarrow Formulas Lutein 20mg, 60 SoftgelsI've been taking the Lutein for the better part of a month. So far I absolutely have noticed a difference and in a good way. I was noticing a \"darkening\" of the vision in my left eye, which I haven't dealt with, with my doctor yet. I take a lot of vitamins and added the Lutein. There is a definite brightening of my left eye vision. Yes I need to get my eyes examined anyway but in the meantime it is amazing to see a difference. I will be reporting this to my doctor and see what else is needed. Sometimes you take a supplement and notice nothing, in this case I did and it's good. There have been no adverse reactions so I'll be continuing to take this formula with the zeaxanthin.
B0013OX9NC These soft gel capsules are small and easy to swallow. I experience no undesirable flavor when consuming the pill.The capsules consist of marigold petal extract; each tablet provides 20mg of lutein and 1mg of zeaxanthin. The other ingredients consist of soybean oil, beeswax and mixed tocopherols. The gel capsule is made from gelatin, glycerin and water.I am unable to determine whether or not my eye health has improved, but if these extracts contribute to macular protection and visual function, as the product claims, this supplement is a welcome addition to my diet.
B0013OX9NC Got these as a substitute for the Preservision that my husband takes. These are the same shape, different color and less expensive by a lot. I expect that they will be just as helpful. Easy to swallow.
B0013OX9NC I spend all day at the computer and have sensitive eyes, so I'm open to trying almost anything to protect my eyes and improve my general eye health. After using this supplement for almost a month, I have noticed no discernible improvement in eye health. I don't expect a supplement to improve my vision. But this didn't do anything at all. No reduction in eye strain. No reduction in light sensitivity. Nothing.
B0013OX9NC I had the opportunity via the Amazon Vine Program to sample, Jarrow Formulas Lutein for eye health.  I've had severe nearsightedness since early childhood. I have to have specialty contacts ordered because no retail store carries my strength in contacts.  My worst vision was 20/875 and 20/825.  After, a six month mega dose regimen of Maritime Prime Pycnogenol in the late 90's, my eyesight improved at least 100 points in both eyes -as testified to by my eye doctor.  I have had issues which include diabetes, eye infections, corneal abrasions (imagine your eyes being rubbed with rocky sand), recent diagnosis of onset cataracts and other eye conditions of which I do not recall (though very scary).I have taken the softgels and noticed none of the negative side effects reported by some other reviewers such as distasteful odor, taste or repeating.  I have a very sensitive stomach, so if it bothered me, I would notice and report it.I do not see any improvement with my vision from taking this product.  That said, I do take a lot of prescription medication which may impact this product's ability to heal or repair the eyes.  Several of my medications impact the level of fluids in my eyes, nasal passages and create dry mouth.  Since drug manufacturers are much more inclined to report the positives and not the negatives - just look at the number of class action suits against pharmaceutical and medical device companies - then I can't truly ascertain the benefits of this product.I like the Jarrow Formulas line and I may consider continuing this regime for a longer time.
B0013OX9NC Lutein is supposed to be good for the eyes. I'm hoping this will help with some seasonal allergy symptoms  that can cause fuzzy vision and mucus. But this is yet another softgel by Jarrow that downright smells bad! We just got half a dozen different softgel supplements from Jarrow, and virtually ALL of them have a very distinct and unpleasant smell. Yuck! It doesn't encourage me to want to keep taking them or buy again. Clearly it's something in their manufacturing process. Guess I'll just plug my nose and keep downing these smelly things. Do they work? Who knows? I can never tell if supplements are worthwhile. It's been said that Americans have the most expensive urine in the world, from all the over used supplements.  Not sure which side I fall on that, but I do know I'll probably never get smelly softgels made by Jarrow again. Just my 2cents.UPDATE: just found a better quality alternative:Trunature Lutein (25mg) and Zeaxanthin (5mg) Softgels, 120 Count
B0013OX9NC My mom just had cataract surgery on both her eyes and her doctor suggested to her to take Lutein to help maintain good eye health for her.  Before the surgery she couldn't see well past her nose, and after surgery her vision jumped to 20/30 vision.  She's been taking the Lutein and mentioned that the pills are easy to swallow, don't seem to have any side effects, and she's happily enjoying her good vision.  Hopefully these pills will help maintain her good sight - she's enjoying seeing things clearly again!
B0013OX9NC I wanted my boyfriend to try this supplement because he has the dry form of macular degeneration and his eye doctor suggested he take PreserVision (the one he buys does not contain Lutein) and Lutein to ward off any further eye damage.  He's taken PreserVision for 3-4 years but has only been a few weeks on this.  So far he has no side effects from either product.There's Lutein 20mg and Zeaxanthin 1 mg in each softgel. Other ingredients are soybean oil, beeswax and mixed tocopherols.  Each softgel consists of gelatin, glycerin, and water. The softgels contain soy but do not contain, wheat, gluten, dairy, eggs, fish or shellfish, or peanuts or tree nuts. The bottle claims to support visual function and protect the macula. Dosage is one softgel per day with food. From the research I found on WebMD it appears Lutein is absorbed better with a higher fat meal.Being that my boyfriend has had no side effects and this softgel has a decent dosage of Lutein, his doctor recommends Lutein along with PreserVision and studies say that Lutein works, I consider this five stars. Of course, according to WebMD: \"There is 44 mg of lutein per cup of cooked kale, 26 mg/cup of cooked spinach, and 3 mg/cup of broccoli.\"  Therefore, if you ate a cup of kale per day you would get double the dose of what's in one Softgel here.From my perspective, any Lutein supplement that does not cause side effects and has a sufficient dosage I would rate five stars because studies have suggested it is suppose to work.
B0013OX9NC I used to buy from Puritan Pride found these gave them a try work just as good and cheaper will buy again
B0013OX9NC Jarrow's Lutein seems to be an excellent choice for vision benefits. I've taken it for several months, and while the changes are subtle, they're definitely there.My vision seems to be sharper and clearer, and by some miracle, I didn't need a change in my eyeglass prescription for the first time since I got reading glasses.Definitely worth a few bucks to give your vision a boost.
B0013OX9NC I must admit that I like products from this company, because I have had good luck with them. This is another that I would recommend if you are looking to looking to protect or improve your eyesight. I offer that this is has been a good addition to my health regimen that over time has made a slight, but noticeable improvement.
B0013OX9NC I am a 57 year old female and have worn glasses for about 20 years. I am a real estate title examiner and spend a lot of time reading legal documents on top of loving to read a wide variety of books.  In spite of recently getting new glasses I began noticing that I was having trouble focusing on specific words or letters. I guess this is due to me being near sighted in one eye and far sighted in the other eye, but to me it seemed like my eyes were constantly jumping around. Driving at night was also becoming a problem with the glare from headlights. After taking the Lutein for about two weeks I was driving home after dark and was amazed at how clear everything looked and the headlights didn't bother me at all. When I got home I found something to read an noticed that my eyes could now focus on individual letters. I am definitely happy with this product and will continue to purchase it.
B0013OX9NC This is yet another Jarrow product which I have in the house and use everyday. But I don't use it for myself, I use it for my dog. Lutein is an antioxidant which helps the eyes perform well, and keeps them from slowly degrading. Lutein is found in the macula and the lens of the eye as well as breast, cervical and skin tissue. It is naturally found in dark green, leafy vegetables like spinach, collard greens and salad greens, etc. Since these greens are not really a big part of the canine diet, many dogs succumb to an eye disease called Pannus. To help keep my dog's eyes healthy, I give her one softgel a day, along with a few other supplements. It helps a great deal and I'll never stop giving her the best.I'm on a plant based diet so I do get plenty of Lutein from organic fresh foods but if I miss a day of dark green, leafy vegetables, I will use this supplement. Lutein has been known to decrease macular degeneration & cataracts and guard against too much UV radiation sunlight. Lutein and zeaxantin also use their antioxidant abilities to keep us free from free radicals, and may help protect against atherosclerosis (fatty deposits in arteries), which can lead to heart attacks. I like the Jarrow brand and I feel these supplements do wonders. I can highly recommend them for yourselves or your pets.
B0013OX9NC The thing about preventative supplements is that you really won't necessarily see the benefit in terms of a dramatic improvement.  I didn't start on Lutein expecting it to have any noticeable short-term impact on my farsighted/nearsightedness, or those \"floaters\" that are an early indicator for cataracts -- and it hasn't.  The question is more whether a lutein supplements, for me, can forstall or prevent macular degeneration, or whether this little pill is just doing its bit towards making my country's sewage the Most Nutritionally Supplemented Sludge on the Planet.I don't know where I stand on all that, but after reading some study literature, I am having a relative with eye issues ask the doctor about lutein on her next visit.  As for me...I don't have a family history of macular degeneration, so maybe I don't need it, but I have seen some noticeable improvement in my (aging) skin over recent weeks, particularly around the eyes - weird, considering no change in other products I use, and guess what?  A web search on \"Lutein and skin\" uncovers a fair amount of research strongly supporting the notion that Lutein improves skin hydration and elasticity.Obviously this is just personal/anecdotal and I'd be skeptical, too, except for my own experience.  I do have to remember to take this with food, as either it orJarrow Formulas Magmind Nutritional Supplement, 90 Count(which I started at the same time last month) is causing minor nausea on an empty stomach.What I might not have continued for the sake of my eyes, I may end up keeping for the sake of my vanity!
B0013OX9NC Okay, I'm not talking about goggles here I'm talking about softgels.  Very small, easy to swallow, tasteless softgels.I was taking VISION OPTIMIZER BY Jarrow which was helping with my dry, tired eyes but stopped to try this instead.  Jarrow's Lutein formula has 20mg of Lutein, twice the amount found in VISION OPTIMIZER but not much else, as in, 1mg of Zeaxanthin, and that's it.  Now, I've read that Lutein is important for eye health but I don't know how much you need.  Maybe 10mg is enough?  Or, maybe you need 20mg or why else bother.  I don't know.  What I do know is that the extra added ingredients in the VISION OPTIMIZER formula seemed to relieve my dry, tired eyes better than the plain Lutein formula did.That doesn't mean I'm going to stop taking this.  I might end up taking both just to make sure I'm getting enough Lutein to protect my macula and lens.  I'll have to talk to my doctor first.  I just know I want to do everything necessary to protect my vision.
B0013OX9NC These pills aren't too big and should be easy for most folks to swallow. Supplements can be hit or miss, but I've found the Jarrow brand to exhibit quality and be effective for what they are supposed to be used for. My eyes are starting to not work quite as well as they used to, and I feel that taking this Lutein supplement does help or ever reverses that condition. This is all subjective of course, but it has been my experience. Jarrow appears to be a quality brand and I will continue using it.~ Kort
B0013OX9NC I use the Mayo Clinic website to get information about supplements and their effectiveness in treating medical conditions. They say \"lutein and zeaxanthin may...reduce the risk of macular degeneration.\"I also like the Jarrow Formulas brand, and at the current price ($9.09), it's a great deal, especially if you have Amazon Prime. Unlike drugs, supplements generally have little or no side effects. It's always worth giving them a try to see if they help you.
B0013OX9NC Been taking for a month now, once capsule a day. No reactions taken with food or on a empty stomach. I have horrible allergy eyes and I swear these have made a difference. I haven't had a itchy eye attack for over two weeks and with the pets and my allergies I have to believe these are making a difference. In front of a computer 10 hours a day my eyes don't feel as tired either- I will re-order, having great results
B0013OX9NC These are fairly normal sized brown softgel tabs.  They are not shaped like capsules but more like elongated pills, like maybe a small berry - and they are easy to take.  They go down well without dissolving before they get there.  They don't have any bad taste and no aftertaste at all.  It's very easy to take them, and forget them.I noticed recently that I'm having a very hard time seeing smaller and smaller print, and I know that smaller than usual optic nerves anyway, so I thought this would be something I could do to try to preserve my vision.  Lutein is cited in several studies as being a helpful nutrient for the eyes.I've taken it about 3 weeks but can't tell any difference, but also I can't tell that my vision is any worse, which could mean it's working.Amazon has a good price on this compared with other sites I looked at, and Jarrow is a very good brand that I trust and have a lot of positive experiences with.
B0013OX9NC I was diagnosed with early age-related macular degeneration. Of course, I was shocked & horrified. How helpful the optometrist was to sell me a lutein product that would &#34;improve&#34; my AMD and supposedly it did. Because of the high dollar cost of their product, I researched on Amazon for an alternative Lutein product. This product has done an even better job of preserving my eyesight.
B0013OX9NC Jarrow Formulas Lutein Softgels promise health to skin, cervical membranes, eyes.  As I age, I've got 2+ shoe boxes of supplements in my daily regimen.  I have eye problems, bone problems, and cholesterol problems.  I've learned recently that supplements besides the popular ones like calcium, Red Yeast Rice, and Fish Oil can be helpful, and give support as well.  I have a doctor who has recommended that I take less of some of the popular ones, and give others a try.I rarely eat carrots, or leafy, dark vegetables, so these are good.More from Amazon:Amazon.com Product DescriptionLutein is an antioxidant carotenoid that occurs in nature with zeaxanthin; a closely related carotenoid. Lutein and zeaxanthin concentrate in the eye's macula and lens; as well as in the skin; breast and cervical tissues.* Both lutein and zeaxanthin protect the macula from degradation normally associated with aging and oxidative stress.* The macula is responsible for focus and color differentiation. Lutein and zeaxanthin are found in dark green; leafy vegetables. While the average American intake of lutein is only 2 mg per day; other population groups consume up to 20 to 25 mg per day.* Jarrow FORMULAS Lutein is extracted from marigold petals. Each softgel contains 20 mg elemental lutein from lutein esters; which are naturally occurring; more stable and are well absorbed. Keep out of the reach of children.At a Glance:Provides effective levels of the important eye-protecting nutrients lutein and zeaxanthin that must come from dietary intake*Better stability and absorption with naturally occurring lutein estersFor adults of all ages who are concerned about maintaining healthy vision*Provides effective levels of the important eye-protecting nutrients lutein and zeaxanthin.Better stability and absorption with naturally occurring lutein esters.View larger.Two \"Minor\" Carotenoids Provide Major ProtectionJarrow Formulas Lutein is a blend of lutein and zeaxanthin extracted from marigold petals and then purified into crystalline form. These carotenoids (a family of brightly colored pigments in plant foods) are less common than their better-known relative, beta-carotene, but they appear to offer more and greater benefits to the body. In particular, lutein and zeaxanthin have been shown clinically to support visual function and to protect the health of eye tissues as we age.* In addition, preliminary research suggests that lutein and zeaxanthin may support the cardiovascular system and help to maintain normal cell differentiation in the tissues of the breast, cervix, colon and skin.*Healthy VisionScientists believe that lutein and zeaxanthin contribute to the density of macular pigment--the component of the eye which typically absorbs and filters out 40 to 60 percent of damaging near-ultraviolet blue light (near-UV blue light) which strikes the retina. The denser the pigment, the more the inner retina is protected from light-induced damage. Lutein/zeaxanthin also helps limit blue light damage to the inner retina by protecting against lipid peroxidation and by neutralizing free radicals.*Considerable evidence shows the importance of lutein and zeaxanthin in supporting the health of the eye lens as we age.
B0013OX9NC After nearly a half century of better than perfect vision, I finally started having difficulty reading very small script on some bottles (like this one!) last year. It's a very minor thing, but I've always been very grateful for my vision, and as an art and nature lover I sure appreciate the minutiae they constantly reveal, thus I've been trying various foods and supplements to see if they can help. Lutein is among the most common suggestions, so I gave it a try.While I've noticed only a tiny improvement in the astigmatism, I certainly have found that my color perception is stronger. Hues are more complex and there seems to be a little more definition between shades. Blues and reds are also deeper. Is this due to the lutein? Impossible to say 100% yes, as I'm also doing more oil pulling (look it up, very simple, cheap and useful for many health issues) and taking other supplements, so it may be a combinatory effect, but I feel safe in saying that this lutein is making at least some difference in my eyesight. If your eyes are less than perfect, it couldn't hurt to give lutein a try for a month and see what you think, and think about what you see.
B0013OX9NC I've been taking Jarrow Lutein for a couple of weeks, and it seems to be helping some of my vision issues. My vision has been getting blurry, especially early in the morning, and I get eyestrain easily. Since I've been taking this product both conditions seem to be improving. I'll keep taking it for a while to see if things continue to improve, or whether I'm experiencing the \"Hawthorne Effect\" (thinking things are better simply because I'm doing something different).
B0013OX9NC I guess I get enough Lutein in my diet because after a month of using this per the directions I have not noticed any difference in my eye sight.  I need reading glasses and this dietary supplement has not changed that.  I also haven't had any negative effects, just no effects at all.  Maybe I need to use it for a longer period of time, I don't really know.  If you need this type of supplement, then this should be a good choice.  Jarrow is known for quality supplements, these are easy to swallow as the pill is not large at all.
B0013OX9NC I have never had good eyesight, and I have noticed increasing problems as I've aged. I'm concerned enough to take this supplement. Like beta-carotene, lutein (in the form of Marigold petal extract) helps counteract the effects of aging on vision. Furthermore, lutein is an antioxidant and aids in cell growth and repair.One capsule a day makes it possible to get the necessary amount of lutein. The capsules are easy to take and have no aftertaste.
B0013OX9NC I'm still taking this supplement so I don't know the long term results, but my eyes seem a little less tired and sore, after being on the computer all day.
B0013OX9NC I use Lutein for my vision.  It seems to help w
B0013OX9NC The softgel capsules are small and easy to swallow. I have been taking them for over a month now with no adverse effect. Occasionally the fillers in supplements can cause me to experience stomach irritation; no problem with the Jarrows Formula. Another plus, they are reasonably priced and delivered to your door.I have not see any change in my vision, but I was not having any problems to begin with. On the advice of my physician, I have started taking Lutein along with Vitamin A to help prevent the development of macular degeneration. My mom suffers from this disease and it is known to run in families.
B0013OX9NC I've notice a decrease in my vision over the last year. I think it has a lot do with regular aging and looking at the computer screen more often.  For the last month I've started using Jarrow Lutein andHerbal Eyebright Extract - 1 oz - Liquideye wash.  The eye wash worked immediately to clear up my vision.  It felt like it removed a film that was covering my eyes (perhaps the increased blood flow).  And I think that the Lutein is helping to build up my eye health at a deeper level.  I've seen my improved vision stick around these last weeks and I feel that my eyes will only get healthier.
B0013OX9NC I started taking this when I first received it. But after a doctors appointment, my physician instructed me to stop taking them. As a diabetic, she wants me to get my sugar numbers under control first. This is why I'm having trouble with my vision. So until then, to be continued . . . .
B0013OX9NC I have vision issues related to an autoimmune disease.  As of now there is nothing the various specialists I've been to can do for me.All three of the various vision-related doctors I've been to have recommended lutein and/or lutein w/zeaxanthin to help slow my vision loss.I've been trying various brands for the past year and the vision deterioration slowed, but hasn't ceased or gotten better.I tried the Jarrow formulas lutein because I've had good luck with this brand in other supplements.  The softgel is easy to swallow, they smell unpleasant, but aren't intolerable.  I haven't noticed any difference after 30 days with this brand of lutein compared to the others I've tried.  As I haven't had negative side effects I will continue to take this supplement until my doctor says to do otherwise.I've gone back to juicing greens as that has proved to be the best thing I've done for my vision and results are noticeable fairly quickly.
B0013OX9NC What can I say about a supplement?  It works to quiet the flashers in my eyes and the caps are easy to swallow.  I have Amazon ship them to me every 2 months so I don't run out.
B0013OX9NC Jarrow Formulas' lutein is packaged in easy to take 20mg softgels. The science around lutein's value when taken as a supplement to help prevent AMD remains inconclusive, but there are no warnings about side effects when taken in reasonable amounts over long periods. The packaging and promotional script certainly lead one to think that lutein may be a sort of magic bullet, but I remain skeptical after taking it for a week.I would agree that a week in not a sufficient time to see what effect, if any, this supplement will have, so I am remaining neutral regarding any benefits for me at this time. I plan to continue with the remainder of these capsules and will revisit this summary at that time to update any improvements I might experience.I cannot think that anyone with AMD will see any real, rapid improvement, but if this supplement at least conveys some degree of protection, it would be worth integrating into one's regimen as it is not expensive and Jarrow seems to have a good reputation regarding the integrity of its products.Update: It's now been 2 weeks, and so far, no changes in the way my eyes feel or in my vision.Update 2: Well, after a few more weeks of taking this supplement, I can report that nothing has changed. My eyes are no better, there are still tired after a day's work, and this product may have long-term benefits but, for me, there is nothing else to note.
B0013OX9NC This is good product. Getting what you need and what you asked for. Not combined in a multi-supplements where you also get a lot of unnecessary and potentially harmful agents as well.
B0013OX9NC It's easy to swallow.  I cannot tell if it has helped my vision or any of the other physical enhancements the makers say it might do.  I've taken a lot of supplements over the years for various things, but as I can recall, I've never noticed any improvement or extra anything.  But, if doctors are telling their patients to take a Lutein supplement to help macular degeneration or other disorder, then I suspect it will help.
B0013OX9NC I'm getting older, so this seems like a good supplement to help my rapidly declining eyesight.  I like Jarrow products in general, the bottles are not impossible to open, and the capsules and soft gels always arrive intact.  These are easy to swallow, cause no indigestion or other stomach problems, and although I can't say for sure they are improving my eyesight, I feel confident that this antioxidant is  good for my health in general.
B0013OX9NC My eyes were intermittently dry, and getting more so, more frequently. My doctor suggested taking a lutein supplement as a solution. After taking one of the the Jarrow Formulas Lutein 20mg every morning with breakfast, I noticed the problem going away. There was definite improvement after just a few days, and it's so long in between noticing any dryness of my eyes, that I'm sure it will eventually be gone entirely. While it continues to improve I continue taking the Lutein daily as insurance to make sure my body has enough of this to complete its healing process. I am very happy with this product.
B0013OX9NC Over-the-counter supplements don't always contain the amounts  stated on their labels, so I usually check the relevant ConsumerLab report (available online by subscription) before I begin using a new supplement.  CL tests confirm that JARROW LUTEIN does in fact contain the promised 20mg of Lutein and 1mg of Zeaxanthin.  CL also found this Jarrow supplement to be among the lowest-priced (for 10mg of Lutein) of its tested brands.Lutein and Zeaxanthin are thought to reduce the risk of macular degeneration and cataracts, both of which occur more commonly in older people.  Both conditions are treatable, but macular degeneration causes irreversible loss of vision in the central part of a person's field of vision.  If you eat a lot of green leafy vegetables, you probably don't need a Lutein supplement; however most U.S. adults get about 2mg a day from their diet, while adults in other countries get about 20mg.  There isn't any standard \"daily requirement\", but the 20mg in this Jarrow supplement seems to be an average recommended amount.I particularly like supplements sold as softgels, because softgels are easier for me to swallow than compacted pills (or even capsules).  This Jarrow Lutein softgel is rather large (3/8\" wide by 5/8\" long), but it's still easy to swallow.  How well it works, I cannot say, because it's basically a preventive supplement that scientists are still studying.  However, if you want to take a Lutein supplement, this Jarrow product is a good, economical choice.
B0013OX9NC I rely on my eyes for my photography work, so it's a no brainerto take out some extra insurance and keep my vision just as healthyas possible.  Sure, I need glasses, but I've never had problems seeingor driving at night and I want to keep it that way.I believe in the old saying, \"An ounce of prevention is worth a pound ofCure.\"  Especially in this day and age where drugs have so manyside effects.  It's important to keep your health and well being in yourown hands.Great product and I've been using Jarrow for several decades.
B0013OX9NC Started taking Lutein when various problems made getting dark, green, leafy vegetables difficult. The recalls of spinach, romaine lettuce and bagged salads along with the Texas drought had me searching for other sources. This nutrient is essential to avoid the vision stealing macular degeneration that runs in my family. I along with many people need their vision to be independent and taking this supplement helps when the actual sources aren't readily available.
B0013OX9NC I was advised by my eye doctor to take one of these daily when I was diagnosed with macula degeneration in one eye. I bought my first bottle, 30 pills, at Walmart but then discovered that I could actually get twice the amount for the same price at Amazon. I firmly believe that they help my vision (along with the professional treatments I receive). These are NOT a prescription but help with general eye health. Though they are not very expensive it is always nice to find a cheaper price. Who says Walmart can't be beat? Just go and check out Amazon.
B0013OX9NC As you probably know, antioxidants have a variety of benefits (fight free radicals which are the primary cause of cancer, promote cellular health, promote cardiovascular health, etc etc). So the more you get, the better.This Jarrow formula contains a spectrum of antioxidants. And the price is right - at only $4.50 per month (60 softgels for $9). I'm taking it primarily for cardiovascular health, but the extra antioxidants are a great long term \"insurance policy\" to protect against free radicals and other potential problems. I'm definitely adding this to my daily vitamin regiment.
B0013OX9NC I didn't have much hope for this Jarrow Formulas Lutein, because I had a severe allergic reaction to the last vision supplement I took,Jarrow Formulas Vision Optimizer, 90 Capsules(which actually made my eyesight worse).  Thankfully, I never experience any negative reaction to the JF Lutein, and my eyesight started improving after only two weeks.  It wasn't a drastic improvement -- but where I usually have to zoom in when I'm browsing the web four times, I'm now only having to zoom in three times with my browser.  That is something I really didn't expect.  To say the least, I'm thrilled!
B0013OX9NC Lutein and zeaxanthin are carotenoids, important to the functioning of the macular area of the retina of the eye and found especially in green leafy vegetables such as kale. The source for Jarrow Formulas lutein-zeaxanthin supplement is marigold petals; carotenoids are what give these flowers, carrots, and egg yolks their yellow and orange colors. Other ingredients include mixed tocopherols (vitamin E) which are used in various body processes.This supplement seems to be of good quality and the bottle I received has an expiration date of 09/14 which is 20 months from now. It contains 60 opaque gelatin capsules each with 20 mg of lutein and 1 mg of zeaxanthin.  It also contains soybean oil.
B0013OX9NC Sometimes descriptions for products such as Lutein sound too good to be true. I was delighted to find the claims for this product were factual and true beyond my expectations. The label says it \"Supports Visual Function and Protects the Macula.\" Dry and itching eyes have been a problem for me for some time. When the supply arrived, I took the capsule per day as directed. On the third day it occurred to me that I had not had to use eye drops or had any itching at all. It is wonderful to have my eyes feel so good. I shall continue to take the Lutein from now on. I don't know if others will have the same results, but I am extremely pleased with the improvements I have noted to the condition of my eyes. I have already ordered additional supply, and I intend to tell my eye doctor what good results I have had with Lutein..
B0013OX9NC I noticed my vision getting worse in the past few years so when I saw that lutein might help I was eager to try a bottle.  This formula offered by Jarrow contains 20mg of lutein and 1mg of zeaxanthin which may protect the macula from degradation associated with aging.  If you already have dark green, leafy vegetables such as kale in your diet then you may already be getting enough of these two nutrients.  However, the bottle states that the average American intake of lutein is only 2 mg per day and I know that I fall into that category more often than I would like.  I have not experienced any side effects from this formula and I have already felt some improvement in my vision.  I only have to take 1 softgel per day and it is not a large capsule so I am able to get it down easily.
B0013OX9NC Jarrow Formulas Lutein 20mg, 60 Softgelsis a quality supplement.  I generally have the most trouble taking soft-gels.  But these are reasonable in size, about 1/3 the size of larger \"horse pills\" common for fish oil and Omega-3 capsules.  And while the long term effects of taking these is yet to be determined, so far I have had a good experience taking these.I am in my 3rd week of using the product at one capsule per day.  For the first week I took this, I only took it every other day.  After easing it into my diet I have taken one daily with dinner.There are a number of claims associated with this product, as with any supplement or vitamin.  This substance is reported to support visual functioning and protect the macula.  I cannot verify those claims.  In fact, they may not be verifiable.  How does one prove it is not protecting your vision?What I can say is that the pills had a strong odor, almost that of fertile soil.  I was worried that they might be extant, but I have been taking them anyway with no negative consequences.CONCLUSIONJarrow generally makes quality products.  While I can't verify the advertised benefits, I can say that it hasn't done me any harm.  So if you are looking to take a Lutein supplement, this one is well worth considering.  I will update this after longer term use.Enjoy.
B0013OX9NC I am a fan of Jarrow and after reading reviews of their various products I see that others are as well. I like to read and surf online for hours a day. Lately after a few hours the words are blurred and its frustrating. Also this causes me watery and sometimes dry eyes and I googled my symptoms and found that Lutein is helpful with eye site. I found Jarrow Formulas Lutein 20mg, 60 Softgels on Amazon and after using it a month I seldom have blurred vision at the end of the day. This product claims to help several vision problems but it is not Laser surgery and it doesn't claim to be. I am near sided and haven't yet noticed improvement on seeing far away.I can tell you that it does help with my symptoms, tired and blurry vision late in the afternoon/night. I am seldom frustrated with blurry, watery, sometimes dry eyes at the end of the day. I am a believer in natural rememidies and Lutein is made from the marigold flower. I found this quote interesting &#34;Lutein is an antioxidant carotenoid that occurs in nature with zeaxanthin; a closely related carotenoid. Lutein and zeaxanthin concentrate in the eye's macula and lens.....Both lutein and zeaxanthin protect the macula from degradation normally associated with aging and oxidative stress.* The macula is responsible for focus and color differentiation.&#34;I don't usually use quotes in my review, but I found this the best method of describing what I'm trying to say. THIS IS NOT A SNAKEOIL type remedy. I highly recommend Jarrow Formulas Lutein 20 mg if you have any of these symptoms.
B0013OX9NC If one is going to use this combination of supplements to enhance \"eye health\", with the concurrence of an eye care professional, this is an easy product to implement into one's regimen.  They are not too large--the size of typical vitamin E caplets, and covered with the same plasticky coating.  I personally have no problem swallowing them, since they are about one half the size of the usual fish oil 1000 mg. bubble.  While they do cling to the plastic compartment of my pill dish, they do not adhere to the other pills in the dish, nor leak.  I have noticed no aftertaste, and have no idea if they are going to enhance
B0013OX9NC I just finished the bottle today.  I took this twice a day with my eye vitamin for a month.  I didn't notice a difference.I'm going to stick to just the eye vitamin since it was basically the same.  I'm glad I tried extra Lutein.  I was hoping it would make a big difference but it didn't.  It probably is still a good thing to take.
B0013OX9NC I started taking these Lutein softgels after my eye doctor advised me to start taking them. Now, it's not really possible to review the long-term effect of taking them - I'm told that in the long run, these may help your eyesight What I can review: the softgel itself.These softgels aren't overly large - good size, but not massive. They are the size of the average vitamin, but don't have any of the sharp angles that some vitamins have that make them hard to swallow. Instead, these softgels are super smooth and slightly rounded. Finally, there is no unpleasant taste to the coating on the exterior of these softgels.
B0013OX9NC This is a nicely priced Luetin supplement compared to other brands.  I will be buying this item when out of it.
B0013OX9NC Jarrow is a company that I seem to trust. The seemingly high quality of ingredients and wide variety of supplements they produce indicate to me that they are serious about the supplements they produce.I've been taking the Lutein supplement for 30 days and cannot say that my vision has improved in any way that I can discern. However I am confident that the Lutein is beneficial over the longer term for my vision and will help somewhat in slowing or helping to prevent macular degeneration. At least that's my hope.I'm had no ill effects taking this Lutein and it is now part of my daily vitamin ritual.
B0013OX9NC OK I admit I don't eat enough vegetables, but I am allergic to tomatoes, onions make me gassy and greens just taste horribly bitter to me. I decided to try these to supplement my diet and I have to say since I started I have been fealing much better.The eysight benefits would be a bonus, my vision is 20/10 in one eye and 20/80 in the other, so any help would be good.Overall, I think I will keep taking this one.
B0013OX9NC The Jarrow brand, if you are unfamiliar, is well respected in the natural food community. e.g., it's sold at my local organic food co-op. These lutein and zeaxanthin antioxidants may be of particular interest if you are concerned about macular degeneration, and the like.Luteins are no joke. Macular carotenoid researchers are actively exploring up-to-date and evidence-based hypotheses and the supporting research data into the role of the macular carotenoids in age-related macular degeneration (AMD), vision, and cognitive function. You can search on the web for macular carotenoids.
B0013OX9NC I was disappointed for not seeing USP on the label, because this would give me some sense of knowing what is in each supplement. There are too many products that say they are the greatest since slice bread was invented, but they don't have what is listed on the label. I did a test by soaking one softgel in a glass of water for 30 minutes, and I found that the softgel did not dissolve after 30 minutes. I would not recommend this product.
B0013OX9NC I've been using supplements for many years, and am quite familiar with this product space. I have my favorites, based on results.Jarrow lutein is the first lutein supplement I've tried. According to Wikipediea, this particular supplement is \"one of 600 known naturally occurring carotenoids.\" You can get it only from plants.Carotenoids are micronutrients that have implications for eye health and cancer prevention. Some foods that contain them are sweet potatoes (which I consume nearly every day), carrots, and kale (which I consume every day). It's also found in egg yolks, and I consume 5 to 8 dozen eggs (non-factory type) a week (I never engage in the stupidity of discarding the yolk). The rest of my diet is almost completely fruits and vegetables (I do consume brown rice and raw oats).While I've never had my lutein level checked, it is almost certain I don't have a deficiency. Given this, what can I possibly offer regarding my experience with this supplement? I will show you in a moment.First, let's note that the typical American diet is woefully deficient in carotenoids. Look in the typical grocery cart, and this becomes sadly obvious.If you are on a grain-based, rather than green-based, diet you probably have a lutein deficiency (along with other problems, including low testosterone). Supplementing with lutein for a couple of months while you get your diet in order will definitely help your body recover from the effects of the lutein deficiency it's been through.You may not notice any difference, but that doesn't mean there isn't one. Adequate lutein is mostly a preventive thing, as far as I can tell. So the effect you will have by supplementing with lutein is you'll stop ongoing damage in its tracks. The cancer cells that were staying alive longer and longer in your body will die quicker and quicker, rather than morphing into a tumor. Your retinas will stop, and probably reverse, decline that was going on due to lutein deficiency. To protect the precious macula of the eye, you need lutein. Taking this supplemente provides that protection. So, good news there.Since my diet already provides me with more than enough lutein, what can I possibly tell you from trying this supplement from Jarrow? Several things:Product packaging. I lean toward simply returning something that requires the Jaws of Life to open. I do not buy something with the goal of never opening the package it comes in. Jarrow does properly seal the bottle for consumer safety, but they do this intelligently under the assumption the customer might actually want to consume the supplement contained therein.Capsule quality. I've seen capsules that fall apart. This is bad. So I shook the heck out of the Jarrow container. No capsule failure, there. I've also seen capsules so thick that they don't look like they'll ever dissolve. I can pinch these and tell they aren't going to last long in my stomach's acid bath. Interestingly, these are a one-piece capsule rather than a two-piece. I don't know the implications of that for delivery; if you're interested ask a licensed pharmacist.Nausea effect. My major test was to try this with and without food, to see if it made me feel nauseated. Nope. I feel just fine, no matter when I take this.Dosage. If you look on Wikipedia, you'll see a chart showing how much lutein is in certain foods. I regularly eat almost everything on that list, including (in the summer), dandelion leaves (which I pick myself from my own yard). Raw kale (how I eat my kale) gives you 40 mg per 100 gms of kale. That's about 3.5 ounces of kale, which is about what I eat in a day. This supplement provides 20 mg. So, it's a safe dosage.If you are on the typical American diet, you need to replace grain with green. This is a foundational step in personal health care. During the transition phase, while your body is detoxing and nutrient absorption is probably encumbered, add a lutein supplement to your program. This looks like a good one, to me.
B0013OX9NC I love marigolds, they are so sturdy, cheap, easy to grow, and look fantastic in my garden. Despite this I have no intention of eating them!!!! I'm glad Jarrow researchers have done the work for me to extract lutein from the marigolds and package it in a stable formula softgel. I've been taking Lutein for years, and other than slight astigmatism which is caused by an irregularly shaped cornea, my eyes are perfect and bright. This is now my formula of choice to keep my eyes healthy as I get older.
B0013OX9NC I am 55 years old & my eyesight is rapidly deteriorating, so much so That my Dr. recommended this supplement. It is recommended for good eye health by most ophthalmologists. This dosage was a better value that most name brands I've been researching so I figured I would give it a try, although the initial bottle was offered to me from Amazon Vine. I wanted to be sure I selected a brand that I could afford to continue with if it proved effective in a noticeable way.I think my ability to focus has improved a bit, enough so that I'm willing to give it a few more months of use before giving up. I am testing it by seeing what font size I can read without having to use my reading glasses & squint like crazy! I will update in  a few months.There were no negative side effects that I've noticed with this supplement. I take it with food & a large glass of fluids with lunch.
B0013OX9NC These small gel caplets are easy to take and had no bad aftertaste. I only took it a few weeks, but I honestly thing it helped with my eye strain, which had been severe. I'll continue to take it and update this review if I have other benefits from it.
B0013OX9NC I have taken the entire bottle as directed and have found not even the slightest improvement in my vision. Of course, I do not feel that my vision has gotten worse. What is interesting is that a few days after I finished the bottle, I got a terrible headache (for 4 days).....I do not get headaches. I cannot remember when I last had a headache. I can only think that somehow, it was associated with stopping the supplement. Perhaps I should have slowed down when I was running out? I will not be taking these again....that headache was brutal. I now have even more empathy for migraine sufferers!
B0013OX9NC I've had some problems with my left eye over the past year. Now being 20/30, I've grown more interested in taking supplements that could help prevent further problems with my eyesight.I'm not sure if the Lutein has done its job, but I'm been pleased with the product itself. The pill is tiny and easy to take. The instructions on the pill bottle say that you should take it with food, but I didn't feel any stomach discomfort if I didn't take it on a full stomach. I've had issues with many multivitamins in the past that make me fill queasy if I didn't eat enough food, but this wasn't a problem.I like the Lutein product enough to give it a chance after my current supply runs out. The product is easy to take and I hope it delivers the results that it says it does.
B0013OX9NC This supplement is pretty good.  The soft gels are a great size for swallowing and go down easily. I guess they are working, it's always hard to tell for sure, but they seem to be good.
B0013OX9NC My vision began deteriorating 5 years ago. My eyes had trouble focusing. I learned about a natural means of improving my eyesight called \"Bates Method\" and have been practicing ever since (The Bates Method for Better Eyesight Without Glasses). I also learned in another book \"Relearning To See\" about using blinking, shifting, and centralization. By putting the principles from Bates Method and from the book \"Relearning To See\" into practice, my eyesight began to improve over the years.I thought I'd try some lutein supplements since lutein promotes macula health and prevents macula degeneration. The macula is responsible for focusing. I am hopeful that the Jarrow Formulas Lutein will provide the necessary nutrients to the macula to help me further improve my vision.
B0013OX9NC My eye doctor had recommended a Lutein supplement for my eyes/vision problems, then  in my research and talking to my general physician.. She thought it would be a good idea because of my high potential for arthritis.As many people know Lutein is good for maintaining healthy vision as we age, but it also lowers risk factors in getting arthritis and &#34;may&#34; even help with cardiovascular disease.I choose the Jarrow formula because I have used many other products by them and I have come to trust their brand because they have been using more natural ingredients and less fillers than other brands I have looked into.Most of their products have been soft gels,  this product is as well which makes it much easier to digest because I have a relatively weak stomach.In closing my vision has become more comfortable. I feel like I have been straining and squinting a lot less which may have been a placebo affect but my physicians agree that regardless of all that this is still a good supplement to add to my diet.
B0013OX9NC I'm not a doctor. I have no way of doing serious research as to whether these are what they say they are: both chemically whether they are as good a source of Lutein as they claim, and physically whether they really effect my eyes. I have used a number of Jarrow products, though, and feel pretty confident that their formula is a good one. Experientially, too, I have noticed something of a difference fairly quickly after using them.I read a lot and write a lot, and am on the computer for work far more than I'd like to be. I am near-sighted and wear glasses for driving and watching movies and such. When I'm reading, though, I have to take them off. I think that the combination of taking my glasses on and off throughout the day, looking at the screen and at books and at writing a lot of the time, all of that creates a lot of eye strain, and it's noticeable to the point where I have to just close my eyes sometimes for a while in the evening. I've noticed, though, that after taking these for a week or so, I was feeling less eyestrain. I had less blurriness. I could work longer. I can't, for sure, say that it's due to this supplement. Still, it feels noticeable enough that I'm going to keep using it. If you're like me, or for any reason worried about your eyes, it's worth a try.
B0013OX9NC Supplements are a bit of a crap shoot. The designers make something that - on paper - would seem to be healthy for you, but can't guarantee any results. Results are a mystery, sometimes, because you can't exactly hook up your body to a diagnostic machine and say \"Yes, my __________ is operating with a 12% increase in efficiency,\" or \"It appears that my __________ has regenerated back 3% of the mass that I had lost.\" Unless there is some outward physical change or a noticeable boost to metabolism or energy level, the effects of a supplement are almost impossible to discern. Too, the effects of a supplement are not often immediately noticeable. Sometimes you need to take a supplement for an extended period of time before any changes in your body even come about. This product is a mystery to me. I've been taking it for about a month, now, and I can't say that it is doing anything, at all, to my body. As such, I can't really give it a positive rating. If I could tell it was actually doing something positive (or negative) I would be able to write a more informative review, but that just isn't possible at this point in time. If I notice anything different by the time I have consumed the entire bottle, I will come back and relate that. For now, two stars is the best I can give it.
B0013OX9NC It never occured to me that food supplements could do anything for my weakening vision, due to age.  I was sceptical at the claims, but decided that I should take advantage of the chance to try Lutein through Amazon Vine and I'm glad I did.  The improvement isn't exactly marvelous, but it's definitely there and worth the money to continue using.
B0013OX9NC On a routine visit to my eye doctor, he did the test where they dilate your eyes and shine a ray of light (directly from the sun, it would seem) into your eye so they can take a look around.  He pronounced that I have Drusen, which apparently are the first sign of Macular Degeneration.  After I got back up off the floor, I asked what the treatment is for this affliction.  He said basically there is no cure and the best you can do is minimize or delay the effects through diet and supplements with certain vitamins and nutrients.  He recommended switching from regular multi vitamins to a \"silver\" version for \"mature\" adults, adding Fish Oil daily and taking an eye-specific supplement with Lutein.  I stocked up at my local warehouse store and chose Ocuvite with Lutein but figured if a little is good, then more must be better so I threw this Jarrow Formulas Lutein into the mix.  It also contains Zeaxanthin, which was another ingredient in the sample the doctor gave me.  Please note this product does NOT have all the other ingredients of Ocuvite, Preservision etc since they contain Zinc copper and other vitamins.  Make sure Lutein/Zeaxanthin fulfills your doctor's recommendation before choosing this as the only eye supplement you'll take.  I'm taking it in ADDITION to Ocuvite.I haven't noticed nor do I expect any immediate effect from taking this supplement.  Frankly I'll only know if what I'm doing DOESN'T work and even then, it may not be known for years.  In the short haul, I'll say these tablets are an easy to swallow soft gel with no particular taste.  Wish me luck!
B0013OX9NC This product is a supplement for vision. However, after taking this product for a while, the effectiveness does not seem to occur. The tablets look normal in color and they taste pretty fine. It would be better if the manufacturer mentioned about the time it takes to achieve its effect.
B0013OX9NC I broke my glasses a few days ago, so went in for a prescription today for a new pair.  I felt like it was time anyway.  I had also been noticing that my old prescription, from two years ago, didn't feel right anymore, and suspected that my vision had declined and I might need a stronger prescription.The optometrist told me that this is not the case -- that my vision today is actually much better than it was two years ago, and that I needed a weaker prescription, not a stronger one. (This is the reason things had been looking distorted with my old prescription.)She also said that my eyes were focusing much better than they used to, and bringing together the two separate images into one image more effectively. Two years ago, the doctor has prescribed a prism correction, but I no longer need it.I can think of four explanations:1) I take Jarrow lutein every day (three capsules)2) I take astaxanthin every day (three capsules) (also very good for eyesight)3) I've been doing eye exercises.4) I eat organic/free range egg yolks regularly, which are also rich in lutein.There's no way of knowing for sure which is the explanation, or if it's a combination of all of the above.  But I have noticed that when I stop taking lutein (when I run out), in a few days I'll notice that it's harder to read fine print.  When I resuming taking lutein, my vision starts seeming better to me, within a day.  It's a dramatic difference.
B0013OX9NC I really care about my eye health. I read a book or two a week, and have been for many years. Needless to say, reading is very important to me, so my eye health is critical.  I started taking Lutein about a year ago, but only 6mg from a different company.  I have been taking this 20mg. capsule for a couple of weeks and like most supplements, it is difficult to access the effectiveness.I was diagnosed with Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome, which makes my eyes dry in the evening.  Lutein seems to help. I can say, I have had no side effects and the capsule is easy to swallow. I'm giving it 5 stars because Jarrow is a quality manufacturer and the price is excellent.I bet deer have wonderful eyesight because they always eat all my Marigolds!!!
B0013OX9NC I've been taking lutein/zeaxanthin supplements for many years.  These are less expensive than many of the other brands, and seem to work just as well.  I will use this brand again, and will also look at the rest of their product line.
B0013OX9NC Lutein, known as 'the eye vitamin,' isn't a vitamin at all. It is a carotenoid...a powerful antioxidant found in some fruits and vegetables, particularly leafy greens and those that are yellow or orange.  There is considerable evidence that when obtained naturally from diet, it can prevent loss of vision caused by age-related macular degeration, cataracts and retinitis pigmentosa.  It's found in the color pigment in the human eye, in the retina and the macula, where it serves as a light filter, preventing sun damage in the same way that a sunscreen protects the skin.You can forget the old wives' tales, by the way. Carrots are good for vision, but many vegetables are better.  And some cooked carrots are better than raw. The cooking process releases the lutein. Research also indicates that Lutein is absorbed best when taken with a high-fat meal.Researchers at Harvard found that eating 6 mg of lutein each day lowered the odds of developing macular degeneration, a leading cause of blindness in the elderly, by 43 percent. Other studies show that adding sufficient quantities of lutein to your diet can cut your chances of developing cataracts by up to 50 percent. Getting that daily minimum isn't difficult: one cup of cooked spinach will provide 26 mgs.  All of the studies are based on lutein derived from  natural sources, as part of the regular diet.  Whether the same benefits can be accrued from taking Lutein supplements is not proven. But what the heck, it can't hurt.  I have compromised vision in one eye and am not going to risk anything happening to the one that's still in good working order.I did some poking around on the internet and found a list of lutein-rich foods (figures show amounts of Lutein per 100 grams).Nasturtium (yellow flowers, lutein levels only) - 45,000 mgs per 100 gramsNasturtium (leaves only) - 13,600Kale (raw) - 39,550Kale (cooked) - 18,246Dandelion leaves (raw) - 13,610Turnip greens (raw) - 12,825Turnip greens (cooked - 8440Spinach (raw) - 12,198Spinach (cooked) - 11,308Swiss chard (raw or cooked) - 11,000Collard greens (cooked) - 7694Watercress (raw - 5767Green peas (raw - 2593Romaine lettuce - 2312Zucchini - 2125Brussels sprouts - 1590Pistachio nuts - 1205Broccoli - 1121Carrot (cooked) - 687Carrot (raw) - 256Corn- 642Eggs (hard boiled) - 353kiwifruit - 122All of these options are fairly tasty, with the exception, of course, of the zucchini, which should be banned by any civilized society.Because the jury is out on how effective lutein is when taken in the form of a nutriceutical supplement, I can't rate this product in terms of efficacy or results.  But if you comparison shop and do some research, you'll find that the Jarrow products contain appropriate levels of active ingredients, the price is reasonable when compared to similar products with comparable formulas. They are known to provide high quality products using the latest technology. So, until we know for sure whether or not Lutein in capsule form does any good, I'm going to give it five stars. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn't. I'm buying it for insurance purposes...I would rather err on the side of protecting my vision than risk losing what I have left.There is also some speculation that lutein may help prevent colon cancer, breast cancer, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease. More good reasons for eating pistachio nuts and fresh corn! And remember, for best results, the meal should include fat...so be sure to add plenty of butter to your corn on the cob.(Please don't lecture me about how good zucchini is for us. I don't care. It tastes like a damp towel. I won't eat it. However, if you have discovered some some miracle of cooking magic that makes the stuff edible, please share it. But I'm talking good...asparagus good, pumpkin good. Potato good.  Not crookneck squash good, because that stuff is  worse than zucchini.)
B0013OX9NC Well, I've reached the age at which a quarter of people show signs of macular degeneration and that average certainly doesn't improve the older one gets.  Since a daily glass of red wine to prevent this eye condition has been debunked (at least for now), I'm happy to have this lutein/zeaxanthin supplement, which, although not as pleasant to ingest as the wine, is certainly better than 3 cups of collard greens. So I'm happy to have the opportunity to try this brand of the supplement.  It seems to be quite satisfactory but there's really no way for me to know if it works, except by having my eyes checked annually.  So far I've had a clean bill of eye health.
B0013OX9NC One a night for two weeks and my vision has not improved. Maybe I should have bought the combo with Billberry or whatever it's called.
B0013OX9NC I think it is impossible for me to say whether this is helping my eyes or not.  All I can say is that it has caused no problems.  I was taking one each day, but then read on WebMD that \"Even high dietary lutein intake of 6.9-11.7 mg/day appears to be safe. Lutein supplements 10 mg/day for a year have also been safely used.\" and switched to 1 every 2 days as the 20 mg in each softgel pill may be more than I need.I don't take a lot of supplements and only ordered these because WebMD said they are POSSIBLY helpful with:Age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Consuming lutein as part of the diet might help to prevent AMD, but it's not known whether taking lutein supplements works as well. There is also some information that taking lutein supplements (10 mg per day for 12 months) might help decrease symptoms of AMD, but more research is needed. Lutein supplements don't seem to keep AMD from getting worse.Reducing the risk of developing eye cataracts, when high amounts of lutein are obtained from the diet. It is not known if lutein supplements offer the same benefit.Given the low risk and possible benefit, I am glad to be taking these.
B0013OX9NC Ordered this because my doctor said I need to take it for my eyes.  I guess it works.  But I got a better deal at my local drug store.
B0013OX9NC I have nothing bad to say about Jarrow Lutein. I've found that it seems to work just as well as I would have expected, and there is no bad taste/aftertaste from the pill going down. It's easy to swallow, and the Jarrow brand seems reasonably priced (not the cheapest, but right about in the middle of the pack). As far as effectiveness, I've only been using it a few weeks now and I'm not going to say I've seen a drastic improvement in my eye health or vision, but I have no complaints and certainly haven't experienced anything bad from using it. Overall I can recommend this product as a seemingly solid Lutein supplement.
B0013OX9NC My ophthalmologist recommended that I take lutein for my eyesight. As I grow older my eyesight gets progressively worse. Lutein is meant to support good cell growth and slow the effects of aging on the eyes.  I hope it works but just using it for a short time so far it's impossible to tell. I can say that the pill is small and easy to swallow and I've had no side effects.
B0013OX9NC Eyes need lutein, an antioxidant compound found in tomatoes and other vegetables.  So enjoy tomatoes in your salads -- except that tomatoes grown in poor soil and under less than optimal conditions may not have enough lutein to do the job.  That's when a supplement such as this by Jarrow can help.  The fact that a small amount of zeaxanthin is also included is a bonus to protect your eyes.I've been using Jarrow supplements for about a year, and have found them to be helpful and have also found that their lists of ingredients appear to be accurate representations of what's actually in their capsules. I recommend considering products from Jarrow before going to those of other companies.
B0013OX9NC Macular Degeneration runs in my family so my doctor recommended that I take Lutein supplements to try to avoid the same issues.  These are very easy to take with no bad odors or unpleasant aftertaste.  They are not too big to swallow and do not cause any side effects.  I have found Jarrow to be a reputable manufacturer of supplements and their prices are usually quite fair.  Quality is consistent and superior to many higher cost brands.
B0013OX9NC I'll say right off the bat: I don't notice much, if any, difference by taking these. But I do trust the research, which says that lutein is very good for your eyes. So I take them regularly. I haven't noticed any adverse effects, and perhaps over time they will have a positive effect on my eyes.
B0013OX9NC I've used the Jarrow Vision Optimizer that boasts more ingredients:- Vitamin C, E, niacinamide, B1, B2, B6, Selenium, Taurine, Quercetin, Blackcurrant Extract, Alpha Lipoic Acid, Gamma Tocopherol, Grape Seed Extract, Eyebright, Ginkgo Biloba, Lutein, Zeaxanthin.It might appear that the Vision Optimizer is better than this one (the Lutein and Zeaxanthin), but oh, there's something to consider before letting judgement fall.  The Vision Optimizer capsules are big and harder to swallow, and the serving size is 3 of the capsules per day!Also, the Vision Optimizer has only 10mg of Lutein and 2 mg of Zeaxanthin.This Jarrow Formula, has 20mg of Lutein and 1mg of Zeaxanthin and the capsules are much easier to swallow and the service size is only one.So, if you need more Lutein, this is the one. If you don't like large capsules, this is the one.If you want a more comprehensive protocol, the vision optimizer has a wider range of ingredients that are believed to help the eyes in many ways.
B0013OX9NC This Lutein supplement is a great addition to a healthy diet: taken once a day with water, this is helpful for improvements in skin, eyes, and other tissues...decent price, good product, would recommend!
B0013OX9NC My eyes/vision used to feel &#34;just not right&#34; until I started taking this product. After about 2 weeks of starting with this product, my eyes don't bother me any more. The way I can tell is that I'm no longer thinking about my eyes / vision a hundred times a day! These days I forget that I sued to have an issue with my eyes. In addition to this product, I also use eye drops (lubricant) once a day.I have good vision but since turning 50, I have started using reading glasses.
B0013OX9NC I really do not know how this works, though research says it does. However, if you get Lutein, make sure it comes with a mix of Zeaxanthin. The two together apparently bond together to provide what our eyes need to grow stronger. As I said, I cannot see a difference yet, but I'm only 1/3rd through the bottle. I'm hoping it does something useful.I will come back to review this again, once I have completed the bottle.
B0013OX9NC When I take this Jarrow Formulas Lutein.  I can see better and my vision got clear.  When I forgot to take it one day or two...my vision get blurry....Then I took it and got clear in few hours.  I guess Lutein is very essential for our retina.
B0013OX9NC These  are easy to take with no unpleasant taste or aftertaste.  I believe that Lutein helps eye health - the evidence is pretty overhwelming.After 2 weeks, I haven't personally experience any improvement in my eyestrain/blurriness.  I was hoping for some improvement to the blurriness that sets in after I've been staring at a computer screen for too long.So maybe 3 stars for Lutein, but 5 stars for this supplement if you already know that Lutein does work for you.I will continue to take these because I believe the medical literature that it's good for my eyes, even if not for the specific blurriness issue.
B0013OX9NC It is a small palatable pill and rather easy to take.  As for whether it is useful for my eyes, I could assume Lutein is good and hope that this is working.  I doubt that the effect could be felt in a short period of time. I will give this a try and see if I can see better.
B0013OX9NC My eye guy recommended that I take Lutein, and use a supplement that has at lease 10 mg of Lutein. This has twice that, plus you get 60 softgels. Plus it's under $10, so it's less expensive and has twice the active ingredient than other brands. It's also a small softgel, so is easy to swallow.
B0013OX9NC From time to time, I have taken supplements to help my vision.  I want to try to prevent my eyesight from getting any worse so I am open to trying what the FDA doesn't want you to know it works.  A few months ago my eyes would get tried after the long work days so I was thinking of getting something for my eyes again as I do not want to get a new pair of glasses yet.  I tried these and my vision is doing well, even after a long day.  While I cannot say these helped for certain, I am glad my eyes are doing a little better.
B0013OX9NC My relatives have serious vision issues as they age including glaucoma & macular degeneration. My own eye exams include the higher $ retinal imaging record as a preventative detection measure. Since lutein has been in my regimen for yours, the retinal images have been unchanged for the good or diagnosed as better.Improved absorption of lutein through more current technology is all good.
B0013OX9NC I'm in my 40's and I work on the computer for hours and hours.Recently, my eyes started getting terribly tired in the evening.  It was hard to focus and my night vision while driving seemed to be compromised.  I had an eye exam and my doctor said my eyes were in great shape.  He said some of his other patients were taking Lutien and why not give it a try...Well, I've been taking Lutein for several weeks and it HAS helped!  My focusing is better and things are so much less blurry towards the end of the day.  At night, my eyes are much less tired.  I am surprised and happy to have such a great response.  Placebo?  Maybe.  But, I'm not stopping these to test it out.  They have really made a big difference for me and I'm very pleased to be able to see more clearly and with less strain.
B0013OX9NC I did my homework when I decided on adding a Lutein supplement. I've been taking Jarrow's Lutein formula for over a year now. And I can tell that it helps my eyes because they get worse when I forget to take it! I trust this brand for purity - something you have to check out with vitamin companies.Important: The softgel has a great shape that goes down easy with no aftertaste.Take it and be healthy!
B0013OX9NC I tried these because they worked for my Dad. He swears they help with his near sightedness. So far I have not seen a change in my own vision or eye health though. Fortunately, I have not experienced any side effects from these either. Since they are easy to swallow and cause no ill effects, I'm going to try them for another month or two to determine if this is the type of supplement that must be taken for awhile before having an effect. Also, my ophthalmologist recommends this supplement.
B0013OX9NC i take lutein for eye health- jarrow is a good brand that i trust.  this lutein was at a good price and i believe it is a quality product.
B0013OX9NC Population studies link low levels of lutein and Zeaxanthin to higher incidence of macular degeneration. But the proof of lutein and Zeaxanthin supplements preventing macular degeneration is weak. Since you have only one life, and there are no other means with solid evidence to prevent macular degeneration, I would take these supplements if there is a family history of macular degeneration.Supplement industry, with its powerful lobbying, has managed to prevent its regulation by FDA and so I am always leary of taking supplements and when I do, I only stick to well known brands like Meijer, Costco, Walmart, etc trusting that they have interest in the quality control of what they put on their shelves.Jarrow makes lot of supplements and there is no way for me to personally determine the quality and purity of their supplements. Meijer brand of Lutein has 25 mg lutein and 5 mg of Zeaxanthin compared to 20 mg and 1 mg respectively in Jarrow brand, which as of the date of this review, is half the price per softgel compared with Meijer brand. Jarrow has 60 softgels per bottle (15 cents/softgel) compared to Meijer's 30 per bottle.So if cost is a priority, then this is a good deal. But quality is unknown. On Jarrow web site, I saw no proof of their quality control.
B0013OX9NC Lutein has numerous benefits for your vision. These softgels are the best around in price per mg and a way better bargain that what you will find in Wal-Mart or drug stores. If you're in the market for lutein this is a good option.
B0013OX9NC If you read the information on the bottle this supplement comes in, it tells you that it is not designed to cure, treat, or prevent any disease, though it does talk about how its active ingredient supports tissue in the eye, uterus and other areas. When you decide to start taking any supplement, it's important to know that you are essentially gambling your money on a potential benefit rather than receiving a guarantee. Chances are you can never know if taking such a supplement will assist in health maintenance. My feeling is that, if you are at substantial risk of diseases associated with the tissues such supplements are supposed to support, it may not be a bad gamble to take them. This is why I obtained this supplement.My family has a history of uterine and cervical cancer as well as cataracts. Though I do eat a well-balanced diet which includes food rich in Lutein (broccoli, spinach, eggs with yolks), I figure that with my family's history, a little extra can't hurt and might help. At a price of $9 for nearly a two month supply, this is a pretty economical supplement and it is easy to take. The gel caps are moderate in size and can be taken with food.No one can promise that any supplement is going to perform in a particular way for you, but if you have a family history of any of the problems Lutein might assist the prevention of (macular degeneration, cataracts, etc.) and especially if your diet is lacking, this may be a good option as a supplement for you.
B0013OX9NC I have to admit, I prefer Jarrow products over other brands. They're of excellent quality at a reasonable price, making them one of the best values in nutritional supplements around. The 20mg Lutein softgels are easy to swallow and don't have any odd odors or lingering flavors. They're easy to take and don't upset my somewhat sensitive stomach, even if taken on an empty stomach. If you're looking for a Lutein supplement to help keep your eyes healthy, Jarrow Formulas comes highly recommended.
B0013OX9NC I like the convenience and price of having these Lutein auto-shipped every other month. I take one daily for eye health but found remembering to get them and finding a reasonably price 20mg formula a hassle. Very happy with having them automatically show up every sixty days and getting a discounted price is great.
B0013OX9NC This spring I have been suffering with seasonal allergies that have been worse than usual, especially with my eyes being watery. After a bout this year with a horrible sinus infection brought on by allergies, that even after antibiotics hasn't completely went away, I've been taking vitamins more. Since my own personal diet lacks in the area of not enough dark, green and leafy vegetables and I have a job that keeps me indoors over 12 hours a day, vitamin therapy has been helping.After just one week of taking this Lutein once a day, I can tell the difference in my eyesight and the noticeably reduction in eye watering and eye fatigue.These vitamins are not hard to take for me, and usually I have trouble swallowing pills. They have almost like a softcoat on them which makes them easier to take.Overall, I'd highly recommend these to maintain the health of your eyes, especially if your diet lacks in green, leafy vegetables.
B0013OX9NC If age-related macular degeneration (AMD) runs in your family, especially late onset AMD, please consider this supplement.I first heard about it in various AMD publications years ago, that I poured over when a dear friend became legally blind due to it.Studies have shown that it to be beneficial, so many studies that there was a study to study the studies!!! If memory serves, it was the University of Beijing, but I could be wrong. In any case, the data from a number of studies was examined, along with carefully analyzing if the study has valid data, and it determined that there was a significant benefit for AMD.A minimum of 6-10 mg per day of lutein is suggested, I've been dropping a Jarrow softgel 20mg in a Vitamix smoothie that I share with my spouse.If you don't like kale, which has one of the highest concentrations per serving of Luiein and zeaxanthin, please consider a supplement.
B0013OX9NC I bought this to help with my night blindness.. I dreaded driving at night and would not if I could help it because the bright glare of headlights literally blinded me and so did the reflection of my lights on roadsigns and it scared the hell out of me. I even tried those yellow sunglasses for night driving but they did not help. I am 48 and thought I was going to have to have cornea surgery like my mom but I have no insurance :(. So I googled supplements to help with night blindness/vision problems and this came up.I talked to my dad who is 74 and he said take this it works and that he has been taking it for 20 yrs and has perfect vision.. So I bought this and took 2 on Monday, took 2 on Tuesday and one Wednesday morning on my way out the door at 4am for work for my dreaded 26 mile drive to work in the dark...And as I was driving I slowly realized that the glare of my headlights on the roadsigns did not bother me and that the headlights of other cars did glare at me and i did not have to turn my mirrors like I usually did to try to avoid the lights. As I drove in the dark to work I thought OMG I can flippin see!  lol  The bright glare of lights were no longer blinding me..This cured my night vision problems and cured them fast. Amazing, just amazing...It is so nice to be able to see to drive at night again liki when i was in my 20 and 30s..I will take this for the rest of my life
B0013OX9NC I really like this brand, the bonus is also that the pill is small to take and easy to swallow. After taking these for 2 weeks, I have not noticed a difference. Not sure if I need to take the whole bottle? It can't be harmful so I will keep taking, and possibly order another hoping to see improvement.
B0013OX9NC The product is excellent for eye health. Lutein and Zexanthin is great for promoting eye health. So, this is a good source for those two important vitamins.But, I wished I had read the ingredients list closer, because this product DOES contain soy. If you have a sensitivity to soy, like I do, then you'll want to avoid this product.
B0013OX9NC There is no improved vision here, but after a few days, eyes are significantly less tired after lots of computer time, so it is enough benefit for me. Will keep buying for sure.
B0013OX9NC For those of us over 50 the first line of defense against macula degradation is having your eyes checked every two years (your doctor will probably suggest every year). They have a machine that looks in your eye and gives a colorful display that tells the doctor any signs or concerns. Once my doctor said we should keep an eye on it but two years later he said it hasn't changed and I look ok for now. So while I am not off the hook it appears I won't have problems for a while. And while there is no gaurantee taking a few supplements like this one may help prevent that test from getting any worse.
B0013OX9NC My Dad has emasculate degeneration (hope I spelled that right) and so I am concerned about inheriting that gene.  Figured after seeing this on Dr. Oz to give it a try and after two weeks noticed a big improvement in the clarity of my vision.  I'd definitely recommend this produce.
B0013OX9NC I have no complaints about this product. The capsules are easy to swallow, and I've had no adverse effects from taking them. But neither have I noticed any positive effects attributable to taking the supplement.When I try a new supplement, I like to have a specific goal in mind. Dry eyes have become a serious problem for me, and I'd heard that lutein supplements could help alleviate the problem. I've been taking this product for about a month now, and so far, no luck with relieving dry eyes. I'll keep taking it till the bottle is gone, but I'm not likely to purchase more.With nutritional supplements that promise to prevent future problems, you just have to take it on faith that you're reaping the benefits. There seems to be a lot of well-documented literature about the benefits of lutein and zeaxanthin to promote eye health and prevent macular degeneration. All I know for sure is that it doesn't help with dry eyes.If you've studied the claims and you believe lutein will help you, this product is likely to be satisfactory for you. The only exception would be if you're averse to using a product with soybean oil that is not specified as non-GMO.
B0013OX9NC I am doubtful of a lot of supplements that state they do this or that, especially when the company can't back up their claims with scientific proof.  Lutein supplements are the real deal.  Twelve years ago I got Lasik eye surgery; my eyesight was 20/200 in one eye; 20/400 in the other.  Lasik perfected my vision to 20/20.  I've been taking Lutein ever since and my eyesight has remained perfect, at age 62.  Of course, I can't claim Lutein was solely responsible, but I think it had a lot to do with this.  I like this particular brand because you only have to take one softgel that's easy to swallow once a day.  I received this product courtesy of Amazon Vine.
B0013OX9NC After having a bad experience with the new age fad of sungazing, I found lutein to be effective in getting my vision back to normal. Beforehand, I was starting to have trouble reading bookprint of whatever size for any length of time. Thanks to lutein, my vision has improved so it is not blurry anymore. Jarrow makes a quality form of lutein.
B0013OX9NC I cannot vouch for the effectiveness of this item as the Vine program now insists items be reviewed within 30 days, but I'm happy with the product. There's no way to determine if it has or will benefit my eyesight or anything else in less than 4 weeks. I've tried several Jarrow products and do generally recommend them.
B0013OX9NC We use a zeaxathin product from Life ExtensionLife Extension Super Zeaxanthin with Lutein and Meso Zeaxanthin Plus Astaxanthin and C3g, 60 Softgel,as a part of a health program for vision support, so I thought I'd give the Jarrow Brand a try since it was available to us to try as a part of the Amazon Vine program.I like Jarrow Formulas, as I tend to do well with this brand because of the purity. This product has:No wheat, no gluten, no dairy, no egg, no fish/shellfish, no peanuts/tree nuts. It does contain soy.While it's a good product, after comparing the ingredients with the Life Extension Zeaxanthin, we plan to stick with the Life Extension product. It's got a greater concentration of zeaxanthin from two different sources, a greater concentration of lutein, and C3G that helps support night vision.So this one is fine, but not our first choice.
B0013OX9NC I don't think you can go wrong with Jarrow.If they offer a supplement, it works as described.I have tried many (20+) Jarrow products and I have yet to be disappointed.Give Jarrow a try.This supplement really works.Jarrow formulas are worth it.They come from top quality sources and they are and work exactly as described.
B0013OX9NC I take various supplements every day, and this is one of them. Based on research studies, which I summarize below, I added lutein to my plan. Lutein ia a naturally occurring carotenoid. It is found in green leafy vegetables such as spinach and kale, and also in eggs and animal fat. Lutein is utilized by our bodies as an antioxidant and for blue light absorption.It potentially helps protect our eyes from damage caused by unstable atoms known as free radicals, which can interact with and break down healthy tissue. Lutein may also help to protect our eyes by filtering high-energy blue light. By filtering blue light, the pigment protects underlying cell layers from potential light damage.Also, oral or topical lutein improves skin hydration, elasticity and lipid content.Other research has found lutein can inhibit the thickening of the walls of carotid arteries and LDL-induced plaque on human artery cell walls. Therefore, it is suggested that lutein has strong cardivascular properties.One of the largest case-controlled studies has shown that high intake of lutein from fruits and vegetables significantly reduces the risk of melanoma. Scientists believe these xanthophyll carotenoids prevent melanoma by protecting the skin against sun damage. Korean researchers have found that carotenoids such as lutein and can reduce colon cancer growths. It is currently being studied for breast cancer inhibition.
B0013OX9NC I am not one to believe all the hype about something, and while I wholeheartedly believe in natural foods and  proper supplements made from beneficial botanicals, I know they take time to work. This is why I am in disbelief about how quickly the Jarrow Lutein worked! I (for the last year or so) have used magnified readers when using the computer for long hours, or reading smaller fonts in books or in poorly lit situations. I resigned myself to this new, middle-aged need, begrudgingly.Was I surprised, when in less than a week of use, I did not need to put my glasses on to work. I remembered to get them out of my desk drawer (habit) and never remembered to put them on because I just started working at the computer. No strain, no headache, after hours and hours!
B0013OX9NC I've started taking eye vitamins, even though I'm not sure if they are truly beneficial or not.  I am assuming they are, and these Jarrow ones are very easy to swallow and are nicely priced.  Eye vitamins in the grocery store and drug store cost a lot more.  In fact, they are some of the most expensive vitamins out there!
B0013OX9NC Not sure what I could update here after finishing the first bottle.8 more words required but I have nothing to add.Will update later.
B0013OX9NC At the insistence of my mother, who began taking Ocuvite about 8 yearsago and has excellent eye health in spite of a family history ofcataracts, I recently started taking eye supplements. Initially I wasput off by the cost of Ocuvite, especially since it only had 5mgLutein and 1 mg Zeaxanthin, plus contained other supplements (like VitA & C) that I was already getting. Instead, I started with a storebrand combination gel tab - Simply Right's Lutein 25mg & Zeaxanthin5mg.I'm glad that I had an opportunity to try this Jarrow brand as part ofthe Amazon Vine program, but I plan to go back to my store brand assoon as this bottle is finished. There are a few reasons:(1) PRICE. I get more for my money with the store brand. My storebrand has 120 gel tabs per bottle and costs less than 60 gel tabbottle of this Jarrow brand. Moreover, my store brand contains 25 mgLutein and 5 mg Zeaxanthin, whereas this Jarrow brand contains less ofboth - 20 mg Lutein and 1 mg Zeaxanthin.(2) GEL TABLET SIZE. My store brand's tabs are smaller. This actuallywas a surprise, since there are less active ingredients (mg's) in theJarrow brand. This leads me to suspect that the Jarrow brand containsmore filler & suspension oil. In addition, the Jarrow brand usessoybean oil, which I have been advised to avoid.(3) RATIO OF LUTEIN TO ZEAXANTHIN. My store brand has a lower ratio ofLutein to Zeaxanthin. Lutein & Zeaxanthin appear together in natureand are used in combination in eye supplements. Ocuvite and my storebrand have a 5:1 ratio, whereas this Jarrow brand has a 20:1 ratio.Although higher ratios occur in nature, many eye specialists arerecommend lower ratios in supplements.(4) AMOUNT OF LUTEIN & ZEAXANTHIN. My store brand has more Lutein andZeaxanthin per tab. Zeaxanthin is especially important for the centerof the the macula. As a result, many recommend higher levels ofZeaxanthin. For instance, the American Optometric Association recentlyreported on scientific evidence that suggests 2mg of Zeaxanthin dailyis needed for eye health. This Jarrow brand has only 1mg ofZeaxanthin, and my daily diet does contain the other 1mg.For all these reasons, the Jarrow brand of this supplement is gettinga middle rating from me, and I am going back to my store brand whenthis bottle is finished. I tried it, and I have no reason to doubtthat it's doing what it's supposed. Based on the research I've done, Icertainly don't think it's the best supplement on the market. However,I also don't think it is the worst. Not taking anything, for instance,would be worse.The American diet is deficient in Lutein and Zeaxanthin, so it isimportant to care for our eyes and to supplement our diet asnecessary. However, I'd encourage everyone to do their own research bycomparing ingredients and prices, even seeking out the advice of aphysician, before committing to a particular brand for the long-term.Moreover, shoppers also should also be aware what eye supplements areintended to do. Specifically, Lutein & Zeaxanthin will not restorelost vision, change visual acuity, or correct dry eyes. Instead,Lutein & Zeaxanthin help protect against eye disease, includingmacular degeneration and cataracts. There are excellent medicalresources available at Web MD and the American Optometric Association.Do your own research. Talk to your doctor.
B0013OX9NC My husband and I have been taking Jarrow's Lutein for the last several weeks.  These softgels contain 20 mgs of Lutein and 1 mg of Zeaxanthin.  The floaters my husbands has in his eyes seem to be getting better.  In terms of protecting the macula I assume this is a product that needs to be taken long term to prevent macular degeneration as an older adult.  The cost if used daily  (as sold by Amazon) is $.15 per pill.  Bausch and Lomb advertises a Lutein/Zexanthin/Omega-3 version of Occuvite on television though I have not yet been able to find that triple supplement combination online.  This product is easy to swallow and has no aftertaste or other ill effects at least in our family.
B0013OX9NC My husband has been taking Lutein for years now since finding out it was supposed to be good for eye health.  He is very near sighted and had a detached retina in one eye, so he does anything he can do to keep his vision from getting worse.  He normally takes 40mg a day, so this bottle of 20mg, 60 softgels will last him a couple weeks.I don't believe that this product is something that will improve vision short-term; it needs to be taken continually.  With age, lutein in the eye diminishes and need to be replenished.Jarrow Forumulas seems to be a good product and the price seems good, especially with the subscribe and save.
B0013OX9NC Lutein (and Zeaxanthin) are medically known and with much evidence shown to reduce the risk of AMD (Age-related Muscular Degeneration) and cataract.Due to this reason, I have been keeping my daily intake of vegetables (with Lutein) at about 10-20 mg per day. This has also been a recommended intake for both eye and health benefits as Lutein is a powerful anti-oxidant.However, when we travel, vegetables tend to be a neglected dish and we are glad that with the Jarrow Formulas Lutein softgels, we are able to supplement it to our diet.The pill is medium-sized, has a slight odor and is easy to swallow. One pill carries 20mg Lutein and 1mg Zeaxanthin. A good product to bring during travels or as regular intake to supplement a high protein/low veggie diet.
B0013OX9NC For the last year and a half, I've been concentrating on doing everything I can to prevent my eyesight from deteriorating further. Lutein with Zeaxanthin is one of the basic components of my plan. Although I also take other products, I alternate the rest from day to day. Lutein is the only one I take everyday and I credit the majority of my improvement to this product.The Jarrow formula has the same proportion of the two ingredients that is found in nature when everything is working right. It is a small, easy to swallow capsule, no smell, no aftertaste, and it works. It is also safe, no side effects at even more than this concentration, and no drug interactions.I am obviously doing something right. In the 18-month period, I've had three sets of eyeglasses: the ones I had before I had to start taking prednisone every day. My eyesight was noticeably affected pretty soon after starting and the eyeglass prescription that had been almost unchanged for years became almost useless. I had to get new ones made that were a much stronger prescription. After my latest checkup, those were too strong, and I am almost (not quite, but close) to my old prescription.In addition to this Lutein/Zeaxanthin product, I also take bilberry, choline (a B vitamin) and, twice a week, beta carotene and the AREDS formula. (Note: the last two I take with restraint because both vitamins A & E can have side effects in excess and I'm uncomfortable taking 500% or more of something on a daily basis).My eyesight has, not only not deteriorated further, which was what I'd hoped for, it is almost back to where it was before. I am very happy and relieved, and I am going to continue doing exactly what I've been doing.
B0013OX9NC I was diagnosed with macular degeneration several years ago. I immediately started taking lutein (from various providers) and it seems to me there's been no significant deterioration in my eyesight, which leads me to believe it is beneficial. Of course, this is all so subjective. There's absolutely no way for me to know this definitively.The Jarrow Lutein compares favorably with other brands I've taken, and the price is comparable to what I usually purchase from Sam's Club or Costco.
B0013OX9NC The softgels, to me, are easy to swallow.  This product contains 20 mg of Lutein, which is more than some of the other brands, but also less than some.  Be sure to read the labels before making your purchase to find out the desired milligrams vs. price.
B0013OX9NC Almost ten years ago, my father lost his vision to Rapid, Wet Macular Degeneration.  He did all the right things.  He went to the best Ophthalmologists in our area.  But, unfortunately, he was one of the small percentage of people whose progression can not be stopped, even with the right treatment.  I learned through his diagnosis and treatment that Macular Degeneration is highly genetic.  Even though I was only about 40-years-old at the time, I started to take a much more educated and pro-active role in my eye care.  My own Ophthalmologist recommended that I begin taking supplements which contain Lutein to support my eye health.  For the past ten years, I have been taking a well-known eye care supplement brand; but I have always been bothered by the fact it contains other supplements which I already take for other conditions.  I have always felt I was taking more of certain supplements than I could ever benefit from.  Then, I found Jarrow Formulas Lutein.  It contains only the supplement I really need for my eye care, and not other supplements which I am already taking in other forms.  This is just what I have been looking for!  Thank you, Jarrow Formulas!
B0013OX9NC We tried the Jarrow Lutein 20mg, and there it is a fine quality product. Jarrow is known for its quality ingredients. The reason we aren't giving this 5 stars is that the increased dosage doesn't seem worth it. We normally take a lower dose (and therefore less expensive) and there is no noticeable difference in taking these. So I'd be hard pressed to say: \"spend extra for the higher dose\". But if you are new to Lutein, and can find these at a good price, by all means use them.
B0013OX9NC I have used several and still use Jarrow products. I seem to have had an allergic reaction to the Jarrow Formulas Lutein. This product is made from Marigold petals. My reaction was tightness in the lungs, small hives on my neck and swollen and sore joints in my hands after taking the recommended dosage for 4 days. I am not going to be too quick to blame this product, but every indication leads me to the Lutein. It could have been coincidence, some other external cause or this product. I take several vitamins, minerals and other food supplements including some from Jarrow. I have never had a problem with them and have taken them for from 3 months to several years. All things seemed to be the same except the addition of Lutein. I stopped taking the Lutein after 4 days, and 2 days later all symptoms were gone. Since everyone has different reactions to the same foods, etc. each must judge for oneself.
B0013OX9NC After my left retina detached I learned about vitamins that promote good eye health. Lutein is perhaps the most important. We have used Jarrow before for other supplements and trust the brand. I am hoping to prevent a future detachment by taking lutein daily.
B0013OX9NC I have been reading a lot about Lutein supplementation and have been interested in trying it for a long time. My sensitive stomach issues, however, always prohibited my decision to purchase.  I have been pleasantly surprised by these softgels.  I do not experience an upset stomach or heartburn as I have with many other supplements.  This is a very big deal to me.I believe it will take quite a while to fully realize the potential benefit of taking Lutein, but I'm willing to stick with these Jarrow softgels over the long haul. (Subscribe and Save is definitely the way to go.) The company has an excellent reputation and wide range of products, though the brand has proven impossible to find in stores - at least in my area.Like all supplements, some will notice a difference and some will not. (You can say the same with a lot of prescriptive meds as well.) Overall health, lifestyle choices (activity level, nutrition, etc.), age, and compliance with suggested daily use will all play a role the outcome.
B0013OX9NC Approaching age 60, and suffering from common deteriorating eye performance, this supplement is right up my alley.  After a little over a week, I think I am already seeing some improvement in reading performance and night vision.  The long term benefit is pretty widely accepted on this stuff.The lutein in the Jarrow Formulas supplement is extracted from marigold petals, and purportedly supplements the body as an antioxidant, acting in much the same manner as spinach (an excellent vegetable choice).  Lutein specifically combats aging and degeneration of the macula (delicate light/color sensing area in the rear wall of the eye).  As a general tissue health enhancer, lutein is also believed to enhance cardio and skin health and complex tissues such as cervical and breast tissue.Each medium size and easy to swallow Jarrow's softgel contains 20mg lutein.  Recommended dosage, one per day.Contains no gluten, nuts, dairy, shellfish.  Interestingly . . . I have gotten used to always seeing a boilerplate warning on Jarrow Formulas supplements containers warning pregnant women, people under medication, etc.  However, there is no warning of any kind on this container.Jarrow has an excellent reputation.  Lutein has widely recognized benefit and this deserves to be a key item on my vitamin shelf.
B0013OX9NC In just 3 days I saw an improvement in my eyesight.  It also helped my dry eye syndrome.  Good purchase, and I have recommended it to a friend of mine for her eye problems.
B0013OX9NC My doctor actually recommended I try something for my eyes, so when this came up I felt it might be good. It seems to take the blur from my vision some, which is a good thing considering. For a while i had a lot of trouble with my nightsight and thought it was an issue of my vision getting worse or me getting older. Now I'm thinking it might be correctable and am thinking of starting to use these more regularly.
B0013OX9NC Lutein is one of those supplements which can't be accurately quantified in an informal way since it's a preventive nutrient. The claims for it suggest that it maintains eye health and promotes good cell regulation.  Thus, if you don't get cancer or suffer macular or retinal issues while taking it, it might be the lutein and then again it might be that you just aren't getting any of those things. Bottom line here is that anyone with a health problem that might lead to one of the things that lutein is supposed to prevent, might want to consider taking a lutein supplement.  I take it because I'm diabetic and eye health is a real issue for us.The Jarrow formula contains about twice the recommended dosage of lutein, and while up to about 11.5 mg a day is generally thought to be safe, I'm taking a capsule every other day to be on the safe side.  More isn't always better, particularly when you're dealing with a nutrient that's not water soluble. To risk being indelicate, you'll pee out any water soluble nutrients your body doesn't use.  You'll store the fat soluble ones and they can build up, which is why being cautious with dosages of vitamins A, D, E, and K is so important.
B0013OX9NC Sometmes when I'm tired or working late my vision gets kind of blurry, taking 1 or 2 of these almost immediately clears my vision a bit. Though I dont have any profound clinical vision prolem, I can't help but think this can also be a prophylactic
B0013OX9NC I've noticed that Vitamin A has a positive impact on my skin, so I was eager to give Lutein a try because, as they say, it's like a super vitamin A.To better test the results, I temporarily cut out my usual intake of Vitamin A supplements to see if the Lutein would do even better or worse. For two weeks I took the recommended dose of 1 capsule per day (with a meal). I did not see any improvements, although I did not see any negative reaction either. The capsules swallowed easily and my body gave no upset complaints to the supplement.After the two weeks, I decided to see if taking two capsules per day would make any difference. It did not, that I could see. No noticeable skin improvements and no upset stomach or reaction.Unfortunately my eyesight is already great, so I wasn't able to monitor any potential effects it may have on the eyes (which is its main benefit, as they say).Overall, I deem it about as good as Vitamin A in regards to supplements that improve the tone and texture of skin. Although I didn't notice any miracles, having stopped taking my usual A supplement, I believe I would have noticed a negative reaction if the Lutein was less effective than A, so I believe it was doing something. Since the price is great and Jarrow is a trust-worthy company (one of my favorites), I feel these supplements deserve a positive rating.
B0013OX9NC I have tried to rotate a lot of these Jarrow products, because my kitchen drawer looks like a drugstore.  I have just begun taking these and I haven't seen a difference in my vision. My eyes are ok in the morning and I only use glasses for driving and at night when my eyes are tried and can't focus.  We will see if these pills help me as I take them.
B0013OX9NC This formula has excellent amount of Lutein, 20mg, and price is very good, about 1/2 the price for same formula of 'brand name' in CVS.  Please take with food as softgels are fat-soluble.  I already take a lot of different vitamins a day, and was glad this addition is just one small softgel.
B0013OX9NC Jarrow Formulas Lutein 20mgAmerican Optometric Association says there is no recommended daily intake for lutein and zeaxanthin, most recent studies show a health benefit for lutein supplementation at 10 mg/day and leaxanthin supplementation at 2 mg/day.Lutein (LOO-teen) and zeaxanthin are important nutrients found in green leafy vegetables as well as other foods such as eggs. Many studies have shown that lutein and zeaxanthin reduce the risk of chronic eye diseases, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and cataracts.AMD and cataract incidence are growing. Worldwide, more than 25 million people are affected by age-related macular degeneration and the formation of cataracts. AMD is the leading cause of blindness in people over age 55 in the Western world and the incidence is expected to triple by 2025.This is captured from the American Optometric Association website.  I wasn't sure how to rate something like this as how do you know that it is working unless you conduct a double blind study with statistically viable numbers over a decade.  Since I don't have a decade or population to conduct such study, I am dependent on my own research.  My ophthalmologist has recommended taking Lutein.  This product provides that at a reasonable price of $9.99 at Amazon.  The star rating is based on value for the money, it does NOT say this will work or is working since I have no way to prove that.  However considering the consequences of blindness, I will take whatever steps necessary to possibly prevent it.
B0013OX9NC After a 23andMe genetics test indicated an increased possibility of developing macular degeneration, my ophthalmologist suggested that I add a zeaxanthin supplement to my diet.Will it help?  Beats me...and one person's experience is hardly definitive.  But as long as it doesn't cause any unpleasant side effects (and I haven't had any), I don't see any downside, especially when the upside is some protection against MD.
B0013OX9NC Jarrow Formulas Lutein 20mg are an excellent source of Lutein and Zeaxanthin. As we age, our eyesight diminishes and isn't what it used to be. The combination of ingredients in this product are formulated to help improve and sustain the eyesight and eye health as we age.Knowing what I've witnessed many relatives go through all sorts of diminished vision and other eye problems as they aged, I'm determined to do what I can to avoid as many of the same problems as best as I can.I want to live as long as possible and have the eyesight to enjoy watching it all happen around me!
B0013OX9NC The \"typical\" American diet is deficient in many compounds. We don't eat enough veggies and we miss out on a lot of the good foods necessary to keep our bodies running at optimal health. Lutein is one compound sorely missed by many, unless you are a big salad eater. My eyes are already pretty bad (most likely from a childhood of eating crap) and I don't want them getting any worse. I plan to incorporate this into my busy (and sometimes veggie deficient) lifestyle.
B0013OX9NC After eye surgery I have had trouble with halos around lights. The doctor said it would probably take 6 months to have them go away, if then. I started taking this supplement and in less than a month the halos are hardly there. I will continue to take the 1 recommended capsule a day and hopefully it will continue to work.The ingredients in here are some of the same that are in green leafy vegetables which also help vision, so evidently this will add to any natural foods you are taking to improve your health.
B0013OX9NC After reading so much about Lutein and its Properties I decided to get \"Jarrow Formulas Lutein 20mg, 60 Softgels\" Lutein Supplements are use to Treat or Prevent Eye Diseases, such as Cataracts and Macular Degeneration known to be build up in the Retina and Lens of the Eye, Lutein is thought to Protect the Eye from Injury induced by Free Radicals. Even though I only been taking it for just a month I know I can see everything a little Brighter...Really! I was Amazed how Bright and Crisp Clear I can see everything, you get results within 3 Weeks, to the Point that I got Lutein Capsules for my Entire Family. I was surprised by the Size of the Softgels, they are a little Big for my Taste, but easy to Swallow. To increase your Lutein intake without the use of Lutein Supplements, include Lutein-Rich Foods like Kale, Spinach, Cabbage, Green Beans, Mangoes, and Papayas in your daily Diet. I like taking Lutein which is part of my daily routine intake Recommended!... Thank You D.D.
B0013OX9NC I received these pills from Amazon so I may review them for you.  I have been having a bit of a problem with my eyes, tired, dry and just feeling off.I have only been taking these a short time but I must review them now, but in this short amount of time they have helped me a little. My eyes are less achy and a funny thing happened I have always had a dark ring around my eyes, and this has happened with another product also,and it happened with this one too, the ring came back giving life back to my dull eyes. Since this product does not cause any side effects I will continue to use them.  I like the way my eyes look and beginning to feel.
B0013OX9NC In today's world, bombarded as we are with UV, pollution and etc, not to mention living longer, eye health is important. Lutein has been shown to be a effective tool for vision health. Jarrow is one of the most respected brands in the business. This is also a pretty good price and easy to take, with no nasty \"vitamin burps' afterwards.\"Looks like\" you'll want to get some, then.
B0013OX9NC I had to give up wearing contacts 10 years ago (even the brands made for dry eyes). A year or so ago I started taking a more expensive brand of lutein and it made a pronounced difference in eye dryness, so I could again wear contacts on a limited basis. I've been taking the Jarrow Lutein for 6 weeks and it seems to be working just as well.
B0013OX9NC This little softgel is about the size of a navy bean and it smooth and easy to swallow. The inside ingredients contain marigold petal extracts, Lutein and Zeaxanthin. The softgel shell is made of gelatin, glycerin and water. Even though there is no wheat, gluten, dairy, egg , fish/shellfish or peanuts/tree nuts, this is not a vegan product because of the gelatin. It is said to be good for the Macula of the eye and to support visual function. I hope it works, as I had a hard time reading the micro small print on the label. Take one a day with food.
B0013OX9XW Natto is a great source of vitamin K which improves circulation and promotes healing. As someone who rock climbs and gets minor injures fairly often, I find the ability of my blood to clot a priority. whether it's a placebo effect or not, I have noticed that cuts heal faster and it's easier to stop the blood after injuries.As with all vitamins, try it out, what do you have to lose? The possibility of a benefit that's proven to work for others (such as myself) is worth your personal investigation.
B0013OX9XW I've suffered with muscle cramping, mostly in my legs, but also in other areas, for decades.Since I began taking this supplement, I have had fewer episodes of awakening in the middle of the night with severe leg cramps.I still have to use nitroglycerine periodically for angina but not as much as I was using during the month or so before I started on NattoMax.I haven't noticed much difference in my blood pressure.
B0013OX9XW In many ways Nattokinase is the roto-rooter of the circulatory system. Derived from natto, a fermented soybean dish popular in Japan, it is reputed to have clot dissolving functions.  Additionally, it is believed to support the circulatory health.My mother had a stroke and that type of condition runs in her side of the family. Although to date, I am free of those issues, I thought this might be a good preventative. The capsules are small and easy to swallow with no discernible taste or smell. I have experienced no side effects from taking the recommended one a day. Much harder to assess is whether or not I have been enjoying any benefits. Good health is usually taken for granted. But seeing the results of circulatory problems and clots in others, taking these capsules seem a small price to pay to avoid those undesirable consequences.Obviously, these should not be used it you are on any type of blood thinning medication. But this seems to be an easy and natural way for people with a predisposition to clotting and other circulatory issues to maintain health and viability.
B0013OX9XW Shortly after I received this product I had an injury to my shoulder and my doctor and physiologist told me not to take this in case I needed surgery. They didn't want me to take anything with anti-coagulant properties. Fortunately I didn't need surgery, and completed my physical therapy about 3 weeks ago. At that time they cleared me to start taking the Jarrow NattoMax. I'm not sure if I'm seeing any improvements, but I wanted to try to see if it would help with my chronic pain. I also wanted to see if I had any adverse effects because I wanted my husband to take it for Dupuyene's Contracture - a build up of scar tissue that causes at least one finger to be drawn down toward the palm. I didn't have any adverse effects and he was anxious to give this a try, so I just ordered him his own bottle.I would recommend this to anyone who has a build up of scar tissue in the body - it's worth a try!
B0013OX9XW So far from what I have experienced is Jarrow's products are consitent.Jarrow Formulas NattoMax, 100 mg, 30 CountJarrow Formulas NattoMax is a highly purified Nattokinase with vitamin K removed. Nattokinase is naturally occurring in traditional Japanese food (natto) fermented by Bacillus subtilus natto.NattoMax is concentrated without solvents. Each capsule offers 2,000 Fibrinolytic Units. Nattokinase is a fibrinolytic enzyme that supports healthy circulation by its effects on serine protease-mediated digestion of fibrin.*Its hard to tell super fast because vitamins are vitamins. These seem correct and honorable.
B0013OX9XW Natto is attributed to help reduce blot clotting.  As with any supplement, please seek the advice of your health care provider before taking anything.  Jarrow Formulas, who makes this product, advises that anyone taking blood-thinning products avoid this product.NattoMax contains 100 mg of natto extract.  Other ingredients are cellulose and magnesium stearate.  The capsule is made of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose.  The natto is extracted without the use of solvents.The product contains no wheat, gluten, dairy, soybeans, egg, fish, shellfish, peanuts or tree nuts, and is suitable for vegans.  While it doesn&#8217;t contain soybeans, natto is, in essence, a soy product, so if you are sensitive to soy, take note.  While teh label reads 'no soybean', natto is fermented soybean.The bottle contains 30 capsules, with a dosage of 1 per day unless directed otherwise by your doctor.According to studies, natto consumption can aid circulation, and deter blood clotting.  It also can help lower blood pressure, based on some studies.I began taking NattoMax a few weeks ago, after finding my blood pressure, while not high, was higher than usual.  After taking it, I have noticed my bp a little lower.  I am certainly not suggesting natto as an alternative to good diet and exercise, or medical care, but it is a good supplement to consider.
B0013OX9XW This is truly a Godsend!  Not only does this act as a blood thinner, but it is a good alternative to prescription drugs that make the same claim.  Naturally you will want to talk to your doctor before you start any supplement regimen.  That having been said, Jarrow is a trusted name in health related products.  The results you will get from this will most likely be good.  You don't tend to suffer from side effects from this supplement.  I have read accounts by others who have now started enjoying pain free lives and having blood clots busted up inside of them and become history once they started taking this.  I HEARTILY recommend it!
B0013OX9XW I have been taking this for a couple of weeks and have not felt anything noticeable. At the same time I have not experienced any bad side effects either. But this is one of those supplements where you need to take it consistently for a long time before the effects begin to kick in. And this supplement is vegetarian based with no artificial ingredients.
B0013OX9XW This falls into the category of stuff I'm not quite sure about, because there's no completely obvious test I can do on my own to see if it's changed things. It's not like I have my own bloodwork lab going on.There's certainly a lot of reason to believe that excessive clotting is a bad thing, though I'd probably be careful not to take this if you're about to donate blood or platelets or something, since you do need to do some clotting in that kind of situation. If you're concerned about stroke risk or similar issues, this seems to have some pretty good science behind it for why it's worth taking.I haven't found the pills to be gross or exceptionally difficult to swallow or anything like that which would lead me to say this is something to avoid, at least!
B0013OX9XW These are easy to swallow and don't have a scent associated with the gel coating. I can't really tell if it's working or not so I take off one star for that.
B0013OX9XW As you likely know, Nattokinase is an enzyme created from Natto which is derived from boiled soybeans.  Supposedly, it's a folk remedy for a variety of issues, mostly related to circulatory disorders.  In short, it's a blood thinner, although it may have other beneficial properties.Candidly, I don't &#34;feel&#34; any different, but I will assume that it's doing some good.  Supplements are quite hard to rate, but supposing that it works, it seems like a good product at a good price.  4 stars.
B0013OX9XW I've taken natto before for circulatory issues so I thought I'd try Jarrow brand this time. So far so good. It's not the type of supplement that you'll &#34;feel&#34; working. It also takes time for the effects to kick in. I'm taking it due to some poor circulation in different areas of my body (a hereditary thing). I haven't seen any positive effects yet - it really needs to be taken for at least 60 days for this kind of health problem, but will be back to update if anything comes up. In the past I've only noticed that I would bleed much more easily if I cut myself. It's also helpful for fibroids.
B0013OX9XW This is probably the best way for me to get natto - love it!  Vitamin K-free!  Goodness, I have plenty of supplements with K and don't need more.Natto is made from soybeans fermented with bacillus subtilis.  Some eat it directly on rice for breakfast and it would probably be a good test of my courage to try it that way.  I'm glad to take it exactly in the NattoMax form.
B0013OX9XW I can&#8217;t tell if this has helped or not but the Natto extract supports healthy circulation. I have diabetes with a lot of circulation problems so this supplement was definitely worth trying for me. I will continue to take it because it is just a one-a-day pill and is reasonably priced. I hope that overtime, it can make a difference.
B0013OX9XW Nattokinase is a mix of protein-digesting enzymes derived from fermented soybeans. According to some research, it exhibits a strong  fibrinolytic effect, i.e. it can break-up harmful blood clots and improve circulation.I take protein-digesting enzymes regularly as a part of my supplement regimen. This includes bromelain, papain, and pancreatin (which contains trypsin, to digest protein). Taken on an empty stomach, based on some human and animal studies, they may thin the blood, have fibrinolytic effects, reduce inflammation, lessen the severity of sports injuries, and even prevent the spread of cancer. Nattokinase is another valuable enzyme to go along with these others, except of all the enzymes listed, it may be the most powerful in dissolving blood clots.Since I am younger (35), very healthy (I run about 20 miles a week, eat well, etc), I haven't seen any improvement from taking this supplement. I have taken it along with my other enzymes on an empty stomach before running. I haven't felt anything from taking it per se. However, based on its benefits, I assume it is helping my body avoid inflammation, along with the other enzymes I take.Notice I have mentioned taking this on an empty stomach. Enzymes like Nattokinase will digest food. If taken with food, it will have that effect. The label says take with food, but that is wrong. For the positive health benefits related to circulation, take it on an empty stomach. This way, the enzyme reaches the gut and gets taken up into the bloodstream.One drawback of this product is the price. Other enzymes like bromelain and papain are cheaper. Since I don't have any circulation issues, I will likely stick with cheaper protein-digesting enzymes. However, if I needed them therapeutically to treat circulatory issues, I would definitely add Nattokinase to the mix.Overall this is a good product for a decent price (at least compared to other nattokinase products; all of them are fairly expensive as far as supplements go). I have found Jarrow supplements to be high quality for a decent price, at least when purchased at Amazon.
B0013OX9XW This is a product that has pharmacological effects.  Some folks use St Johns Wort to treat depression instead of taking prescription valium.  Nattomax affects blood clotting and some folks use it a non-prescribed substitute for Coumadin (warfarin).  A lot of people would argue against doing this self prescribing because of the potential for overdose and for unintended side-effects.  However, you cannot argue that it isn;t cheaper than going the prescription route.
B0013OX9XW Nattokinase has been shown to help with lipid profiles. Lowering LDL and Triglycerides and raising HDL.I trust Jarrow's products. I have used them often in the past. Nattokinase alone has been shown to take up to6 month's to see noticeable improvements in blood profiles but it does work. Red Yeast Rice + Nattokinase seems to work faster.Improving blood profiles as quick as 30 days. You can look at a scientific study preformed by theDepartment of Nutrition and Health Science, Chungchou Institute of Technology here [...]
B0013OX9XW For the past 6 months this has replaced my prescription cumadin without any issues. My INR is great and though my doctors are not happy about being cut out of the money making scheme of prescription drugs they cant argue with the results. I was on the road to having to take blood thinners for the rest of my life and the side effects are unpleasant. When I switched to this the side effects slowly dissipated and now are completely gone. I recommend this to anyone wanting a natural way to get the same results as a prescription. Of course always consult with your doctor first and make sure they monitor you along the way.
B0013OX9XW Nattokinase prevents fibrinolysis (blood clots/too thick blood) and thins blood. Jarrow Formulas makes this NattoMax 2000 without the use of solvents which I like. It does use magnesium stearate as a flow agent; some people seem to think that magnesium stearate is a form of magnesium that has nutritional benefits for humans but that is not true; it is merely a flow agent used to make it easier to fill the capsules and is considered a dangerous poison by many leading medical experts. If you can not find nattokinase free of magnesium stearate, you may want to try Jarrow Formula's NattoMax.
B0013OX9XW Nattokinase is an enzyme extracted from a traditional Japanese food called natto. Many westerners don't find natto appealing since it is made from fermented soybeans and has a weird texture and taste to it. However, natto has been clinically studied to have the cardiovascular benefits of a blood thinner and clot-buster, to promote heart health and improve blood circulation.Jarrow Formulas has a great reputation for making high quality yet affordable supplemental products. NattoMax has the vitamin K removed since too much vitamin K has the potential to increase blood clots. I ordered the NattoMax to try out. I won't know the results for at least a few months. What I do know is that it's easy to take - just 1 pill a day with meal - and certainly a lot easier to take than raw natto.
B0013OX9XW Jarrow Formulas NattoMax is inferior to Jarrow Formulas Red Yeast Rice + Nattokinase, which additionally to nattokinase contains also red yeast rice beneficial for lowering cholesterol, if with monacolin K.  Nattokinase has only a potential to thin blood, but the effective dosage is unknown.  Thus, nattokinase with unknown effectiveness is inferior to plain aspirin with known blood thining effectiveness.
B0013OX9XW I was sent these pills for free to review, but really how can one give a rational review? I took them for weeks, and felt nothing different. No better, no worse. I see Jarrow says they offer over 350 products. Who can afford to take all of those? How are we supposed to choose which ones are actually useful? Maybe they do something, but I don't have x-ray vision to see it.One thing I am not impressed with in particular is that these individual capsules can easily be twisted open with your fingers. With all the product tampering scares over the years, this seems like manufacturing to 1970's standards, to me. Capsules should be permanently sealed.
B0013OX9XW This product is highly recommended for reducing the risk of blood clots and strokes, and has also bee recommended for alzheimer's patients to increase circulation to the brain.I can't vouch for those results as I have only taken this a short time, but the pills are easy to swallow and the scientific studies on this product are encouraging.I would caution against taking this with aspirin as Wiki says that one patient reported a cerebral hemorrhage with taking with this and aspirin, so do use this with caution under the guidance of a physician.
B0013OX9XW I am taking this for a long term benefit.  I wanted to improve my clotting. It is a genetic issue in my family. I haven't had a major bleed while taking this. It is easy to take and I have had no uncomfortable side effects.I find Jarrows products to be high quality and reliable.
B0013OX9XW Actually I know why they removed the vitamin K.  People on Warfarin or Coumadin have their doses set to their current blood levels and cannot change the amount of leafy vegetables they eat or add Vitamin K supplements without exceeding the therapeutic window of their drug.  But hey, that is a niche market (five stars for them) and most of us use natto supplements because both the enzymes and the Vitamin K2.  Jarrow makes great products but my money goes to a nattokinase supplement with the full spectrum.Natto's vitamin K is believed to increase levels of activated osteocalcin and result in a significant reduction in fracture risk.  It also helps blood coagulate.  The stripped down NattoMax does help regulate fibrin. When fibrin accumulates in blood vessels due to age and dietary imbalances, blood begins to flow less freely which can reduce oxygen transport to heart and brain tissue, resulting in suboptimal function. Meanwhile, excess fibrin can make blood vessels less pliable and lead to elevated blood pressure. Even Vitamin-K stripped nattokinase helps to maintain proper blood viscosity, fibrin levels and healthy circulation.To sum up, if you are on blood thinners this is a five star product.  But see if you can work with your doctor to reduce the drugs and take full-spectrum nattokinase and turmeric instead.
B0013OX9XW I can report so far, so good with Jarrow Formulas NattoMax. I have had no trouble taking the 100 mg capsules and no unpleasant side effects.My wife eats natto. I won't kiss her unless she's brushed her teeth. My sons eat natto. I won't sit next to them until they have finished their meal.I can't tell you if natto is more odorous than the King of Fruits, durian, as I haven't traveled to Southeast Asia. From what I've read and seen on TV travel shows, durian and natto are popular with only a minority of the people in the countries from which these foods come.I mention all of this because my wife laughed at me when I first tried this supplement. She offered me a breakfast of rice, dried seaweed and natto instead.\"It is cheaper than taking it from a bottle.\"On that point she is correct. At a cost of more than $10 per month (there's only 30 capsules per bottle), some people might consider eating the fermented soybeans directly. I wish them luck with that as it is too smelly for my palate.I am going to finish out my bottle and add a replacement through Amazon's Subscribe and Save program, which saves me an additional 15%.Rating: Four stars (I'd like to have more capsules in each bottle for convenience.)
B0013OX9XW Nattokinase is an enzyme derived from fermented soy (natto), which is great for clearing blood clots and reducing blood pressure. It normally comes with vitamin K, another blood thinning compound, so Jarrow provides this option of getting the enzyme without vitamin K in case you are already on blood thinning medications. This supplement is safe when used as directed and it is one that is effective for what people usually use it for. Jarrow provides high quality at a reasonable cost. This is certainly an item that can help with specific health concerns.
B0013OX9XW I was very curious about Jarrow Formulas NattoMax, 100mg, but since I've been please with all the Jarrow products I've taken in the past, requested a bottle of 30.  In the test tube, red blood cells do not aggregate in the presence of nattokinase, and since natto is a product which isn't easily available to me, this option for reducing blood clots serves as a viable and more tasty option.  I have not been diagnosed with clotting, however have a genetic disposition and family history, so I'm adding this to my supplement regime.  The vegetarian caps are easy to swallow, I take one daily with a meal, and I've had no reaction or problem.  I'll be ordering the larger bottle to save some money.
B0013OX9XW Nattokinase is an extract that comes from a process of boiling soybeans that have been fermented with a particular bacteria.It is thought to be a blood thinner so it&#8217;s often used to treat issues that affect the circulatory system such as high blood pressure, heart disease, varicose veins, etc. I don&#8217;t have any of these problems, but a lot of people swear by the use of nattokinase.I take it preventatively since blood thinning could protect against blood clots and heart attacks. Obviously, however, there are risks to thinned blood. So, consult a doctor and use care when using this product.I also like the price and the company. Jarrow is a respected manufacturer and adheres to the FDAs GMP (good manufacturing practice). This is important because some supplement companies can be shady. With Jarrow you know the product is high quality and free of adulteration.Overall, this is a great, reasonably priced product that has a load of benefits. If you have circulatory issues, consult your doctor and give it a try.
B0013OX9XW Jarrow Formulas NattoMax is a supplement that is vegetarian friendly.  Natto is made from fermented soybeans and has been used for almost a thousand years.  I have been using the, for almost a month and I'm enjoying the results.  If you're looking to add some natto into your diet then I would start with Jarrow Formulas NattoMax.  Especially for vegans who are looking for a healthy supplement.
B0013OX9XW Since being diagnosed with high blood pressure, I have added an arsenal of cardiovascular-friendly supplements to my diet. The latest is Nattokinase, which clinical trials has shown effective in achieving a moderate reduction in blood pressure. So far, only a couple of days into taking it, I will say that it seems to be helping, showing a couple of points drop since before I started with it. Time will tell whether this will be sufficient, or whether I'll have to take medication.
B0013OX9XW Even though my husband has not has his blood work re-done to see if this has helped any, I still wanted to write about it.  It is a good product in that the pills are easy to swallow and you only need one a day (unless you are directed otherwise by your health professional).  Also, the price is right -I got the 90 ct here for the same price that my local Whole Foods sells the 30 ct for!  Unbelievable.
B0013OX9XW I offer that my past experience with Jarrow's brand of products has been very good. In this case...I am not saying that it has not been beneficial, but it may be just too soon to tell.
B0013OX9XW Because I can't easily find organic natto (the food) I take natto in supplement form.  I am hoping that given enough time it will help to reduce or eliminate some of my health issues such as uterine fibroids, pain during ovulation & muscle spasms.  Jarrow like most of the brands I have found so far contain way too many fillers such as magnesium stearate & hydroxypropylmethycellulose.  Jarrow seems to have the average 100mg or 2000 FU of Nattokinase as other brands as well.  The only difference I've been able to find between the Jarrow brand & others is that Jarrow claims the Vit. K has been removed.The capsules are small & easy to swallow.I'm going to continue to keep a look out in hopes of finding a brand with less fillers.  I recently came across Enzymedica brand & when I finish with this bottle, I think I will try them unless I find something I think might be even better.  With the myriad of supplements I take, I would like to reduce the amount of &#34;other&#34; ingredients as much as I possibly can.
B0013OX9XW While I can't say definitively that NattoMax has helped to lower by blood pressure, it has gone down over the month I've been taking it. It was getting a little high and rather than use prescription drugs, I thought I'd try something a bit more natural. These capsules are easy to swallow and have no detrimental side effects that I've noted. If anything, it makes me feel more mel
B0013OX9XW Since taking this product I have had once cycle and what is usually pretty heavy my period was lighter and flowed better.. Also recent trip to doctor shows perfect BP.. Lots of good research about this product, I received this for free in exchange for review but I will order again ..
B0013OX9XW My husband's blood pressure was running too high and he is against Western Medical treatment.  I saw this and thought it might be worth a try, and he accepted it without any problem.  (This is a man that won't take a Tylenol!)  They are just regular size clear filled gelcaps.  They don't taste like anything to me, and they didn't smell bad.  They are no problem to take.Neither of us had any GI side effects - no burps or unpleasant side effects.After 3-4 days, my husband noted that he was sleeping better -he said I don't hear my pulse in my ears anymore when I lay down.  He reported feeling better.It's about a month's supply, but the supplement itself is definitely a keeper.  His blood pressure started coming down after a week, and is now fairly close to the normal range- it does get a bit borderline but it's MUCH better.For me, I quit taking them because I got a bruise that I couldn't explain.  I don't think I need them though.  My husband, on the other hand, had no bruising problems at all.  Mine might have not been related, but I decided to err on the safe side.The Jarrow brand is very trustworthy to me, and I've never got a product from them that wasn't fresh and of better ingredients.
B0013OX9XW I tried this purely to see if it would help my feet warm up. Natto is claimed to help improve circulation, and I've had mildly chilly toes since I was a kid. I've noticed a little less of the cold feet effect on cold mornings, but not enough to where I can say that this stuff is definitely making a major difference. From the other reviews here and research I've done, this does work very well for some heart and blood pressure issues, and if it's getting folks off prescription drugs while providing the same or better benefits, while not adding the side-effects of most big pharma products, I'm all for it.But since I don't really have a major health issue that this would impact noticeably, I can only give these a neutral three stars. I'll keep taking them, but as it's already warm where I live, it's hard to say if my these are improving my circulation much.Sorry I can't be more helpful, but, honesty first.
B0013OX9XW Natto is fermented soybeans and is a popular food in Japan. This supplement is designed to help with circulation and the cardiovascular.The capsules have no taste and go down easy. I'm also thrilled that this is a supplement that vegetarians can take. It is reasonably priced and made by Jarrow, a company that has a proven history of reliability.This product may also help prevent strokes, and I consider it a good insurance policy to keep myself healthy.
B0013OX9XW Check with your doctor before you use natto.  Don't use it if you are on coumadin or warfarin, and be really careful and CHECK with your DOCTOR if you are on an aspirin regimen or if you are taking other medicines that can cause bleeding or if you have or have had an ulcer.Natto basically thins your blood.  It's great if, like me, you have some hyper coagulability (I do - it's one aspect of SLE for me), but it isn't something you want to take along with other blood thinners (including aspirin, gingko biloba, willow bark, and even vitamin e).If natto is something that is going to be safe for you, this is an excellent brand.  I take it when I need a break from my NSAIDs (every so often, I get bounce back headaches from daily use of aspirin, and I have to take a week off).  This keeps my labs stable while I do that.
B0013OX9XW I've been taking this for a number of years. It is an amazing product. Research it and then try it. It works.
B0013OX9XW Nattokinase is an enzyme that thins the blood.  It is supposed to be similar to what warfarin, coumadin and aspirin do, but I would not stop taking these drugs and using the NattoMax without first consulting my physician.  My husband's cholesterol has been on the high side for years and he has only recently begun taking NattoMax so it is too soon to tell if it is helping to reduce his cholesterol levels or not.  But, I feel it certainly is not doing him any harm and the price is so reasonable.  Also, he only has to take one of these pills each day with a meal - usually breakfast.  Since I am required to write a review within 30 days of receiving this product it is too soon to get another cholesterol check done, but I will update this review when he does.
B0013OX9XW Good price and as always with Jatrow, this is a quality product.  Research the product before using if not chosen on recommendation of someone reputable.
B000A2HDXA I don't play these myself, I bought them for my daughter. They look kinda flimsy but for the price, they are ok for beginners to play."
B000A2HDXA Im a beginner. Good harps. Good solid sound.I cant bend at all so no idea if its just me.Youtube these, there's loads of videos."
B000A2HDXA I have other harmonica's but thought I'd like a set of blues harps.  I thought that if it's made by Hohner, it must be fairly good.  Wow, was I wrong.  Too hard to push notes through them.  I wouldn't recommend these to anyone."
B000A2HOB6 I tried these on my 2008 Talyor GA4e and the sound was just a bit to bright.  The heavier bass strings didn't really add the bassy sound I was hoping for just more of a thud.  YMMV."
B000A2HOB6 Clean and clear sound. Great for strumming and using a pick but a little soft for finger picking. I prefer a string with a little more volume.  They tune well and hold a tune well."
B000A2HOB6 I usually use \"extra-lights\" because my fingers are wimps, I like the bottom E to go down to a small .010. I have heard though, that you get more oomph, bass, and it is better for recording to use heavier gauge strings; so I decided to try and start using lights and mediums instead. Also, I finally bought my first Martin (Woo Hoo!) and researched strings for it, and I read a comment from one person who said the lights would have slight buzz, and the mediums put too much pressure on the neck and he said the \"Light- Mediums\" were a happy medium and a good balance.When I got my Martin D15 M, I cleaned it up, and then restrung it with a set of these \"Light -Mediums\". At first my fingertips protested and got real sore real fast; but that is because I am adding .025 width to the E string (.010 to .0125) ouch!  I  just have to build up my callouses, which will take a few weeks of torture, ugh. But, the sound is AWESOME. Part of it is the Martin guitar of course, but these strings, when I hit the G chord, ring out with a deep, warm and long-sustaining bass thump. You feel it in your chest when you hit the bass strings, the 6th, 5th and 4th.  The treble strings bend pretty easily. No buzzing. They have no coating , so they SQUEAK like hell. (TIP: I put a molecule or 2 of hand lotion on my fingertips 15 minutes prior to playing and it helps keep the squeak down) These strings are great, I recommend them. I will try and update my review 3 months from now and let you know about their longevity, etc."
B000A2HOB6 Tried these on a Laguna acoustic guitar. They are basic standard traditional strings. They sound good, they are light weight. On this guitar they sound a bit too bright. My preference is to use Elixirs, prefer the feel and sound on this guitar (Elixir PolyWeb Acoustic Guitar Strings (Light)).These strings do not last less time than the Elixirs. Mostly fresh strings sound good on a guitar. Some people like a brand new set before every gig, others will go weeks or months before changing. If you are an every gig person, well the Martin set is probably perfect for you - they are much less expensive than others. Leaving strings in for an extended period - Elixirs or other coated strings are probably a better idea.There is no such thing as a perfect guitar string for every guitar. The choice is all about your personal preference and the guitar you play. I think the Martins are a very good value in a standard traditional style. So for the price, these are an excellent value."
B000A2HOB6 Crikey, where to begin. Firstly, I hated the fact that they package two strings to a paper packet. Secondly, they mismarked one of the packets, so it appeared I had two &#34;D&#34; strings, instead of two &#34;E&#34; strings. Lastly, and certainly the least favorably, once tuned up, the strings sounded terrible! They were tinny and clangy sounding. I've never heard worse strings. Fortunately, I had bought a package of Ernie Ball Earthwood med. light, as well. I replaced the godawful Martins with the Ernie Ball's and they were far, far better! Shame on Martin for such a piss poor product. I'll never buy their strings again."
B000A2HOB6 I would definitely buy these strings again.  They are high quality, great durablity and a great price.  The Martin name is synonymous with quality."
B000A2HOB6 I like these even better than the Martin Custom Lights. They give off such a warm tone, and are holding up very well."
B000A2HOB6 After reading all the great reviews, I moved to these Light/Medium strings from the light gauge. They do sound much better and have a better tone than the light gauge. However, I noticed one thing that has driven me crazy. Finger slides are much harder with these strings. The lower strings (E, A G) just don't slide as easily until there is some buildup in them. As a result my fingers get out of position and don't hit clear notes until I've slid those areas a couple of times. That's probably due to the oil and other nasties build up in the strings or me just getting used to them. The packaging was also a bit confusing. Since there are two strings to an envelope, it seems I too easily get the strings reversed on set up. Other string makers I have tried, color coded their strings and it made it much easier to string up. Overall good strings and I'll probably buy them again."
B000A2HOB6 By definition, medium is an in between size. But when it comes to guitar strings, most of the range goes from extra light to medium. On that scale, these strings would be above a literal medium. For me, the guitar is not an everyday instrument. I don't typically spend five hours a day with one, and sometimes go weeks without picking one up. But I do have periods where I will spend many hours a day playing and don't want something that will kill me.Medium in the guitar string sense of the word is too much for me. Light and custom light are easier to play, but can make a higher end Martin guitar sound like one closer to the bottom of the line. For me, these light-medium are exactly where I want my strings to be.If you like Martin's medium, find them a bit much at times, but find that you give up too much when you play much lighter ones, you may find that these are a great choice. I don't feel I am missing anything compared to the Medium. If I had two identical guitars with new strings of each type, I would probably find differences in a side by side comparison. But without that, I don't think I'd notice the difference with normal listening. With the lighter varieties, that would be far from true.If Martin extra light and light were the skim milk and 1% milk of strings, these light-medium would be the 2% that came along for people who wanted something lighter but still came close to the whole milk taste."
B000A2HOB6 love these strings, but I have always been and still am a fan of Ernie Ball, they just sound better, bend easier and have a longer life span, but Martin are very good too, I just prefer Ernie Ball, but they were sold out and I needed strings fast."
B000A6ASSS these are the best strings around.  last a long time especially if you live near the beach where corrosion is always a concern."
B000A6ASSS I keep an acoustic out on a stand in my office to keep handy for when inspiration strikes.  I used d'addarios for many years. I switched to these and their longevity is drastically more noticeable.  they sound great too. The added expense is more than made up for by the extra long life afforded by the coating."
B000A6ASSS They're 2 days on and sound fantastic already. I've come to expect nothing but excellence from Elixirs, they're the best I've played on to date, whether electric or acoustic. I very highly recommend these to anyone looking to get great tone straight out of the box"
B000A6ASSS Personally, I love the nanoweb strings.  I have 4 guitars, and they each get played once every couple weeks.  As I'm no pro, I don't want to put strings on them that I'm going to have to change every time, just to mess around at my apt.I don't mind that they are extra slippery, or that they sound a tad bit \"different\" than other strings.  They're exactly what I want - A string that makes my guitar sound good for 4 months without changing strings."
B000A6ASSS These acoustic strings are used on a Laguna acoustic guitar. They are just the right weight, and just the right amount of flex. We've tried D'Addario, brighter sound (D'Addario Acoustic Guitar Strings Set, EXP 80/20 Lite), and Martin, a little stiff (Martin Strings SP Phosphor Bronze 12.5-55 MSP4150). In the end, these Elixirs sound and feel best on this guitar.The difference between these strings - nanoweb and polyweb - the nano's have a very light coating that you almost don't feel. So if you like standard not coated strings, the nano's are probably the way to go. If you want a bit of softness, the polys are a better bet.As has been said, there is no perfect guitar string for everyone. The perfect guitar string is the one that feels and sounds right to you on your guitar. For the combination we have, these are outstanding strings.On the strings lasting longer, that's hard to say. Fresh strings do sound better. It's clear that the wound strings do not corrode like non-coated strings. But I'm not certain these last so much longer. We buy them because they sound good and have the right amount of flex to them - playability. Corrosion or crud on the string isn't the sole factor in changing strings.Elixir is a wonderful company. On my third or fourth sets of Elixir strings, the G string snapped as my son was tuning the guitar for the first time. Elixir is outstanding, they will replace any string that doesn't perform up to your standard.The other amazing thing - I've watched tons of videos and watched a lot of guys change strings, and I'm still very confused. The Elixir website (it's pretty simple elixirstring dot com) is outstanding. Ther is a two part video from the Taylor factory on how to change strings. I swear that if you follow those instructions, you will change strings in minutes. It is so simple and so reproducible. I love this technique."
B000A6ASSS Elixir Strings are the best I have ever used, they sound great and last far longer (tonally) than anything else I have tried....."
B000A6ASSS I only play Elixir strings.  They are relatively finger friendly, hold their tune well and are much longer lasting than many strings I have played in the past.  These were for an electric acoustic I just bought, which is why I got a lighter string than I normally play.  I will move to mediums once I get the feel of the guitar.  Of course, they will be Elixirs as well."
B000A6ASSS Elixir's Nanoweb Light Phosphor Bronze strings are the best strings I've ever used on my Alvarez acoustic -- a guitar I've now owned for over 30 years.  They certainly are the longest lasting strings that seem to be out there, they have a nice punchy tone, and are easy on the fingers.  Unlike the Elixir Extra Lights that I found to be lacking in bass and just a tad on the mushy side on a short-scale guitar, these seem like an ideal combination.  I may buy another set soon and restring the short-scale instrument with lights.  Compared with some brands and gauges of more \"old school\" strings, there may be a little less bass response, but these sound good, pretty even through the set, and the convenience of not having to change strings so often outweighs whatever minor issues that one might have with the ping of the low E string."
B000A6ASSS You cannnot go wrong with Elixir accoustic guitar strings.  Taste in strings is difficult to discuss as what appeals to one may not appeal to another.  However, you cannot go wrong with those strings.  I highly recommend them.  I like their mellow sound which will last longer than other strings I have tried."
B000A6ASSS This is the only brand I would ever buy the sound is superior and easy to play. These are well worth the money!"
B000A6ASSS I love the Elixir strings. They sound great and play easy. I would recommend them to anyone. Give them a try.."
B000A6ASSS I am a beginner guitar player, so I don't have too much experience with different types of strings.  But, I can say that when compared to the stock strings of my Fender Acoustic guitar, these things are like night and day.  A much brighter sounds and a little easier on the fingers. Highly recommended."
B000A6ASSS You can never go wrong with Elixir Strings Acoustic Phosphor Bronze Strings NANOWEB Coating, 6-String,...The great long lasting sound is worth the extra cost."
B000A6ASSS These strings are just okay - they last about 4 months and then they start to fray a little bit."
B000A6ASSS they seemed a litte expensive but once you play them you know they will last you a VERY long time and their sound is great, these strings are not focused on performance but endurance, best string I've ever played!"
B000A6ASSS I absolutely love these strings. They enhance the deep rich sound on my dreadnought. They last a long time and they keep their great sound for a long time. If there was a way to give 10 stars I would."
B000A6ASSS Polyweb strings have a heavier coating so I prefer nanoweb for the ultra-thin coat and brighter sound. They're easy on my fingers and make the most beautiful sound. Because they're coated and have anti-rust, they last up to months longer than regular strings and don't make much finger sounds. Favorite strings."
B000A6ASSS I only use elixirs on my taylor now 1, because they last months on end while maintaining that new string zing, and 2 because they are super smooth. It's like playing a silk guitar. Get these strings."
B000A6ASSS These strings are noticeably warmer compared to the brighter Bronze Nanoweb. Still a great guitar string. A real winner for Elixir who are the originators of &#34;Goretex&#34; A real triumph of re-invention. Well done Goretex!"
B000A6ASSS If your like me and have a big dreadnaught, especially one with a spruce top and a scalped X bracing, you should really get these strings. They bring out the brightness my guitar was hiding with the D'Daddarios and they are about the same price. Best of all they last extremely long, but I've broken a few strings over the past months. Overall great strings and pretty consistent."
B000A6ASSS Very good string!! I've been using Elixir strings for about ten years now. I've been a full time musician for about 14 years now and for what I do these sound the best and last for 3 or more month's. Within these ten years I've only had 2 strings break on me, and I sometimes work 6 days a week for many for at a time"
B000A6ASSS I have never been much of a fan for coated strings. I normally use DAddario EJ 16's but I do like these Elixirs, after about 4 weeks of playing they are starting to fade, not stay in tune and I notice fuzz on the wound strings at the sound hole. They do feel nice to the touch and a nice tone but pretty expensive for four week turnaround"
B000A6GTDG I am very disappointed. The guitar was packed with its strings tensioned and the top detachment partially from the guitar body.It is unusable until repaired.Update: It has been several days after writing and attach photographs to the seller (Amazon), and have not received any communication."
B000A6GTDG Dont be cheap.  take it to a guitar shop and ask for a full tuning for new guitars.  The low e buzzed pretty bad until i did that.  If you are doing more than just finger-picking, you might want to add pick-shield.  My wife used it for some naked newborn pics and the guitar got most of the compliments which I had very mixed feelings about.  If you play mostly standing, this is the guitar for you.  If you sit down, it slides out from your lap alot due to the curve of the back.  But it is loud and sounds very rich considering the price of the guitar.  Good structural integrity thus far.  My newborn is now 15 months and its is holding up nicely considering how many times she has gotten a hold of it.  I really should get a case."
B000A6GTDG A friend of my has one and I just found in love with it. Great sound! Beautiful color! The Applause exceeds my expectation whether it is unplugged or amplified."
B000A6GTDG No Doubt.... It's not a really exceptional guitar but for the money you get more than you should. First impression of the guitar was terrible. I took it out of the box and started to play. The neck had a huge bow in it. The truss rod was completely loose. I had to adjust the truss rod to make the guitar playable. I'm not sure if it was just my guitar that wasn't set up or if that's the way they come. If they come with a loose truss rod then this guitar is not for a beginning player as properly adjusting the neck is best left to someone who knows what they are going. Once the neck was setup and the guitar tuned I was pleasantly surprised. The guitar sounded pretty good. The neck is thin and has the familiar feel of an electric. Action was good. Upper fret access is really good. The guitar stays in tune while playing. Plugged into an amp playing through the pickup offered no surprises. The bright red red stained finish on the top was a nice touch. I expected red paint. I would have preferred bigger frets for bending and ease of fretting. They are a little small. $175 for a roundback is really a no brainer. If your a beginner or have some playing experience you will enjoy this guitar and the value it offers."
B000A6GTDG This instrument might actually be in a class of its own. That is, it would be extremely difficult to find a guitar in this price band that comes even remotely close in terms of quality; not only with regard to craftsmanship, but certainly the sound it produces. The Applause exceeds expectation whether it is unplugged, amplified, or even run directly through a mixer. Beyond sounding comparatively spectacular, it is far more durable than perhaps any other hollow-bodied instrument on the market due to its components and design. The electronics are reliable and the instrument is accessible, or playable, to even the most novice of musicians. This guitar is the ideal instrument for a beginner or a younger musician, simply because it is cost efficient, durable, and as easy to play for the price as one might be able to find anywhere. Even experienced guitarists will almost certainly appreciate its action, sound and durability if not only for the purposes of practice and travel. This is an exceptional value and an excellent instrument."
B000A6GY1I These strings fit the Bill perfectly for \"MY\" desired sound from a Yamaha LJ-16 Acoustic Guitar which has been \"Doctored\" with Bone Saddle, Pins and nut. When I decided to put the money into the guitar, it was my belief that the Elixir Strings would continue to provide the sound and feel that I like so much in the LJ-16 and after all the work was completed......that proved to be true to form. I did move to the Medium for a little improvement from the Bass side and it's a most outstanding sound from a medium price, hand crafted guitar. Elixir has the best (most comfortable) feel, to me, of all the strings that I've tested and these provide the best (for my liking) sound on this guitar. Try them if it's quality sound that you're looking for..............These are great!!!!"
B000A6GY1I WAY better than stock strings that I received with my Fender acoustic.  I am a beginner guitar player, but I was definitely able to hear a much brighter tone and it felt a little better on the fingers."
B000A6GY1I These strings are my second choice after the Elixir 80/20 Bronze. They are warmer sounding, well balanced. Cost a lot but well worth it to me."
B000A6GY1I Guess this was an open box or dented box but the stuff inside seemed ok.  Will need to check them next week or so."
B000A6GY1I Strings on my accoustic were old, probably corroded.  It was time to replace all with frest strings.  These are great, did the job."
B000A6GY1I I have absolutely no gripes with Elixir nanoweb phosphor bronze strings. I have been using them since the first appeared on the scene and have become my go-to brand. I've read many reviews where some people complain of sting breakage. I have yet to ever break an Elixir acoustic guitar string (in over 10 years of playing them). Can't even imagine. The only other coated string that may be a little better is Clear Tone--but I have had inconsistencies with them and because they cost more, I just go with Elixir and am never disappointed. I'm not a fan of the \"Polyweb\" which has a much more visible thick coating. The nano-webs get it right--they last a long time, sound great, and as far as I know don't flake polymer dust in your kisser."
B000AAGM0M In my house alone we have a bass player, a acoustic guitar player, a sax player and a violinist, that is not counting myself (I attempt to play mandolin and harmonica, usually I fail) so diverse instruments used to require different tuners but with this little all in one the clutter of tuners and pitchpipes is history, I just set aside a music nook in the family room with this mounted to a music stand and everyone can tune before practice, the sax player sneers at us tuners but still finds use for the reference notes and metronome function built into this little beauty.just be sure to buy theKorg CM-100L Clip On Contact Microphone For Tunersif you want to tune your instrument while others are playing."
B000AAGM0M I have had a Korg CA-30 tuner for a few years which I really like.I wanted to get a metronome and liked the idea of having a combined unit.Initially I bought a Boss TU-80 for more money, but returned it because the response time and volume was not as good as the Korg TM-40,and the batteries rattled around in their compartment.Also I like having the middle green LED for tuning.The price here can't be beat and it's a well built item that works great.I was concerned about the power buttons sticking out too much, but they take more pressure that it would seem, and there is a delay until it turns on or off, so that turned out not to be an issue.I am not real hot for the color, but it's nicely made and works well, so I will live with it.I especially like the little folding stand in the back, rather than having to find an old credit card."
B000AAGM0M I have it for more than 6 months and mostly use it for practicing with the metronome.  I have another tuner, which is set EADGBE, that is much easy to tune without any confusion. Although this tuner has flexibility for tuning differently, it's confusing for me because it keeps changing the chord and going left & right +/-20 or more.  However, it's a bonus for using the tuner, and I don't have to bring all to the classes.  For the metronome, which is my initial purpose to purchase it, it's great and have enough adjustable calibration, 13 beats, rhythms, and tempos for practices."
B000AAGM0M I've owned this and a couple of other Korge Tuners in the past, and currently own three.In the past I would use a keyboard to get the bottom E on my guitar and take it from there. These days accurate portable tuners are so inexpensive I keep a few of these around and take at least one with me when I go out with my guitars. I also use it to tune my violin, and it works great.If you buy the new clip on sensor it even gets better.Over all for the cost you can't go wrong. These used to be expensive none-essentials, but today they're small accurate and portable."
B000AAGM0M Got this tuner/metronome as a replacement for a tuner-only model.  This is INCREDIBLY easy to use right out of the package.  The tuner function indicates clearly whether you are sharp or flat (or amazingly in tune).  The metronome is easy to use and has great subdivisions (eighth notes, sixteenths,etc).  For home and ensemble use, I personally couldn't ask for a better gadget for the price.  Very happy with it!"
B000AAGM0M This little box is great for metronome use. It is loud and the screen is easy to see. The tuner function can be a little disconcerting sometimes. It seems to work ok but the display might fluctuate from G to C when tuning to G on a Bass guitar. I used it to set my intonation on a new Bass and it was well worth the price I paid. I would buy another one if I lost this one."
B000AAGM0M I really like this product as it comes complete with all functions anyone needs. I just miss the \"mecanical\" click of a mechanic metronome. The rest is just great. i've bought a cable which allows me to connect the metronome to my line6 amp and the result is much much better."
B000AAGM0M I am quite pleased with this product. It's relatively inexpensive, small and light weight.  It operates on two AA batteries (included). I use it primarily for a banjo and a guitar and the reference is easy to use and appears to be quite accurate.  The LED and large meter allows these old eyes to see it easily. I should have ordered the CM-100 clip-on tuner at the same time (placed a separate order later) to allow to tune in a noisy music (jam or band) environment. You can fine tune your tuning with the calibration settings. There is also a 12 note sound generator built in for reference pitches. The metronome is pretty loud for the small size. I have a hearing loss, so if I can hear it, even while playing, it must be pretty good.  The speeds are from 40-208 BPM. You can select between two modes PENDULUM STEP (Preset values, 40,42,44---88,92,96, etc) or FULL STEP which allows you to change incrementally by one (40, 41, 42---206, 207, 208, etc). Beat tap allows you change the time signature from 0-7 beats and also duplets, triplets, quadruplets and triplets and quadruplets without center beats. It has a 1/8\" mini earphone jack for private use. It is possible to use the metronome and the tuner simultaneously. I bought mine from Austin Bazaar.  Shipping was FREE and FAST. I give it five stars and recommend that you can give it serious consideration."
B000AAGM0M This device functions wonderful but the beeping of the metronome could be a little louder and of a more pleasant tone (sounds like a 1980's video game beep) but I am just being picky. I bought this for my son and he loves it."
B000AAGM0M As an acoustic guitar player, I think this is a great product.I had previously been using the Korg GA-1, which is a fine basic tuner. The GA-1 works like many basic guitar tuners, where you designate the string and it shows you the note in standard tuning (or with one, two, or three flats). But the TM-40 works by just showing the pitch you're currently playing among any of the 12 reference pitches - making alternate tunings and open tunings much simpler.Now I use the TM-40 at home as my main tuner, and the GA-1 rides around in my case. Both great products."
B000AAGM0M Pros: It's a good tuner, it's a good metronome, and it's a great combination package. The flip-out stand on the back makes it easier to see than when it's lying flat. The metronome has excellent selections of different rhythms and is easy to program.Cons: the buttons on the front are raised on top of other raised areas, and it's too easy to accidentally turn the unit on. The tuning sound activated once in my pocket while I was sitting in the audience at a band contest. Also, unlike the CA-30 tuner, this one favors higher notes strongly over bass and makes it difficult to tune low instruments in a noisy environment.Also, it quit working suddenly after about a year. Other people I know who've had this tuner have complained about lack of durability."
B000AAGM0M Works well since I got it. I didn't change battery for more than 6 months."
B000AAGM0M The tuner is perfect for me.  It fits in the guitar case, mandolin case and the dulcimer case.  Just perfect for making those play dates at the Resonance Fair.  Always spot on with the frequency.  Nice product."
B000AAGM0M This metronome is a bit of the big size but there is really nothing like it.. It is so durable filled with options. Very versatile product for the seriousdedicated musician."
B000AAGM0M Tuner works as it should-- almost a little too precisely (it's pretty sensitive).The metronome will drive you crazy.  It has various beats which is a nice touch, but the sounds are horrible.  Think of the most sterile electronic clicks/beeps you can and then add nails-on-chalkboard for good measure.  There are much better sounding metronomes out there.  I bought this Korg for the tuner function and that's about all I'll use it for."
B000AC6DVS Works well - easily keeps my guitars humidified with less maintenance than other humidifiers I've had."
B000AC6DVS Dampit was recommended to me by a guitar instructor years ago, and I have used the standard model for some time. It seemed kind of tricky to get it to hold enough water to humidify the guitar yet still get it dry enough to have absolutely zero drips inside the instrument.I used to hang it by the clip and let it drip dry for about 15 minutes while I was doing other things before placing it in the guitar.Later I wound up trying the Humidipak humidifiers and to help recharge them on a Dreadnought, I took to putting the Dampit in a gallon plastic bag with distilled water and a resealable top, pressing on the sides to saturate it, then rolling it up in a Planet Waves Microfiber polishing cloth and pressing on the end of the cloth to soak it. Then unroll the cloth, put the dampit in under the headstock where a drop of water would just go into the hard shell case, then rolling up the end of the polishing cloth to cover the wet end with dry material and pushing it into the sound hole over the humidipaks. Worked great.So I ordered a super dampit for my new 000 acoustic planning to do the same. They now ship without the clips. Company says they've had too many complaints about scratches, though I didn't seem to have a problem, wasn't about to take a chance with a costly new acquisition. More importantly, there is supposed to be a sponge to absorb water inside the tube and when I pressed on the sides of the tube, it was empty. So I sent it back to Amazon for a refund. No problem getting the refund, but I'm moving on from dampit to try the planet waves insert with a sponge that has eliminated the chance of water dripping in the guitar or damaging the finish.If you use it to soak the polishing cloth as described above, that still works great, but there's really not enough room for that in the OM model, so between that and the missing sponge, will just try something else."
B000AC6DVS If you want to get humidity into a guitar, this product is a must. I works well -- and if one lives in dry area of the country, this is a must have product."
B000AC6DVS Erm, it does what it say it would do. The nice thing about the &#34;super&#34;, is its size, in turn, and its ability to hold more water."
B000AC6DVS Dampit humidifiers have been around for years and years.  I think that I can safely say that the basic design looks to be amazingly similar to what I remember when I saw these for the first time in my university days of the late 1970s.  Generally, Dampits can be used over and over for years.  Sometimes the rubber becomes discolored, sometimes the rubber rips near the end of the Dampit, but basically this is a very workable way to maintain at least a minimum amount of humidity in and around your instrument, something that is especially important during the winter months when artificial heat zaps the humidity out of the air.  This is the first instrument-specific Dampit product that I've ever purchased and it seems to work exceptionally well.  In addition to the standard Dampit, there's a sound-hole cover.  In case it is not clear just how it works, the clear sound-hole cover has a short string with a loop on the end.  You simply attach the Dampit to the loop and it hangs inside the guitar.  My first impression is that it does an excellent job of keeping some needed humidity in the body of the instrument, something very important on a solid-top classical guitar.  I would recommend this over the standard Dampit because the sound-hole cover is so convenient (hopefully it will continue to keep me from having to fish around inside the guitar for a runaway Dampit) and seems to keep the humidity focused in an area that is especially in need of it.  A must have if you keep your acoustic guitar in an environment that gets much below 40-50% humidity."
B000AC6DVS What else is there to say, they are easy to use, they are easy to install and they are easy to check.  I've tried them all and these are the only ones I come back to.  No expensive pads to buy, just use water.  Simple to drop down into the body of guitar, no attempt to fit some rubber block thingy into your sound hole.  Comes out as easy as it goes in.  I have 4 of them.  Love."
B000AC6DVS I live in Arizona and I keep my acoustic in the case with this dampit unless I'm playing it.  It seems to do a good job, although I would recommend purchasing a better meter.  The one it comes with is a simple paper design that gives you a decent estimate."
B000AC6DVS It works well.  This is a classic design that people have used for years and I can see why.  It it isn't broke, don't fix it.The only suggestion I would make is to have a different soundhole cover.  Maybe a sturdy plastic? The soundhole cover that is included is a very cheap, disposable plastic that looks like it was shipped with a cheap trinket.  I think the price is a little high for what it is. Rubber and foam tube?  Why do they charge so much?  I'd like to know the markup."
B000AKSUP2 Recently I switched from a Blackstar HT-5 to a Fender Mustang III V2 amp. Although the Fender is a great sounding amp, you don't get this natural warmth that you get with tubes there's this liveliness that's missing. So, although my cleans sound good, they aren't great. Although my overdrive sounds good... it's not great. Although my distortion... well you get the picture.Since adding this pedal was less expensive than buying a new amp I decided to give it a try. This pedal adds the same kind of sparkle to your sound that you would get from using a clean boost on a tube amp. I believe some people call it &#34;pixie dust&#34; ... that little bit of magic that makes your sound come alive.Interestingly enough, I don't leave this pedal on all the time. But when I stack pedals, or use certain effects like chorus, a shimmer reverb, or any effect with the exception of maybe a leslie... it's pretty awesome.It works different than an EQ... and if you have a tube amp - a clean boost may do the same thing... I think it really adds life to solid state amps."
B000AKSUP2 It's hard to really describe what this pedal does-  It doesn't distort, flange, echo, or produce a chorus.  I'd heard it described as making your amp sound like someone had thrown a blanket off of it.  And because words don't do an accurate job in describing it, I would have probably never pulled the trigger on one (even though they are pretty cheap as pedals go).  As luck would have it, I acquired one on trade, and I have to admit that I agree with the whole blanket euphemism.  This stompbox helps correct the boxy sound of my Blues Jr. when placed at the end of my pedaltrain- right before I run into the amp. I don't feel it needs to be run on a dedicated effects loop to improve an amp's tone, though I do believe it works even better in a loop.  I placed it in the effects loop of both a Palomino V8 (USA/Ampeg made) and a Crate VC508 (a 5 watt USA made EL84 tube amp with Celestian speaker) and it was transformative to both amps' tone (in a great way). It does very well with single coils.  It's a pedal that I would leave on all the time once my tone is dialed in.  I don't think it works as well when I run my LP into a Jet City combo - particularly when trying to coax out subtle textures / harmonics. That amp also lacks an effects loop and I imagine it would have a different effect if placed after the preamp phase.  I guess it's rig dependent, but it's a keeper for what it does to the sound of my Fender."
B000AKSUP2 This is a great pedal to put at the end of your FX chain. I have it as the last on my pedalboard before my GNX4. It's always on & it only took me about a week to settle on how I liked it adjusted. There are only two knobs & I just played around with them untill I was happy with the sound. I do a lot of recording & I also checked the sound after recording. Can't reccomend it enough especially considering the price."
B000AKSUP2 I like it. This is a good pedal for end of line tone adjustments. Like all other pedals, it's not \"The Pedal\" (seems like you always need another one). But it does add to the other pedals in shaping your tone. After you've settle on a setting you like, it adds a subtle, but noticeable addition to your sound."
B000AKSUP2 This pedal essentialy balances out the high, mid, and low frequencies yout instrument produces. I also have the software version of this effect on my DAW. This pedal does a great job of giving your instrument a more balanced and full tone. When I switch it on it allmost sounds like someone took a blanket off my amplifier. I highly recomend this pedal for and and all musicians."
B000AKSUP2 For those of you who are doing jangly pop stuff or real peaky, bitey blues material (think Albert Collins), this will likely add a little, and I mean A LITTLE, extra oomph to your sound. It sounds like it uses a touch of reverb and a dash of the higher end of the mids to make cleans sound more sparkling. But you should also be able to get the same sounds out of a Hughes and Kettner Statesman 40 or 60 watt amp, too, just running it straight.To me, from what I have heard, it adds nothing to those who use a fair amount of distortion in their music. It definitely doesn't add any more fatness. So 
B000AKSUP2 I'm not going to do any explaining about the \"science\" behind how this pedal works. I'm just going to focus this review on how the pedal affects your tone. This definitely isn't a boost, and it's also not an eq, the BBE sonic stomp is a uniquely functioning pedal. To the ear, it serves to add clarity, depth, and body to your tone. Essentially, this pedal allows you to get the most out of the tones your amp is already producing.The lo contour knob doesn't \"increase\" the amount of bass produced by the amp. Rather, it tightens up and generally increases the depth of the bass (and low mid) tone. To the ear this may sound at first like the bass has been increased, but it hasn't. You're just hearing all the bass tone that was there in the first place, that was jumbled up as the signal went from your guitar to the amp.The process knob really just focuses on the treble and high mid frequencies. These frequencies can often be very unpleasant and grating to hear, and the sonic stomp sort of evens and smooths out those tones so they are clearer and less harsh.That's not to say that you can't dial in some very aggressive and cutting highs if you play lead metal or something; indeed, it'll make those searing lead tones even better.Now, I gave this product 4 stars not because I've had any issues with it or haven't been in any way unsatisfied with it; but rather because it's really a fairly subtle effect. At first I almost couldn't tell a difference between having it on and off. With time I've been able to better recognize and appreciate the impact that it has on my tone, but it doesn't make a \"night and day\" difference.I recommend this pedal to someone who already has a tone that you're happy with, and just want to make it even better. This pedal won't make a cheap 15 watt solid- state combo sound like a tube half-stack. It won't make you love your tone when you were completely unsatisfied with it before.In conclusion, though I definitely wouldn't put this pedal into the \"must have\" category, it definitely improves the quality of my tone. This is a pedal that I leave on all the time, as it improves both clean and distorted tones."
B000AKSUP2 This pedal adds that \"I don't know what\" to your sound.I chased a sound for years until buying this pedal - what a difference.If you have great, top quality cable, quiet amps and pedal boards, shielded guitars, fresh tubes - you know the drill - you spend thousands chasing something you hear in your head - then you plug one pedal in and WHAMO!! - there it is!It was THIS pedal for me - just turn the knobs until \"it\" comes out of your speakers.A must have - especially if you are playing clubs, bars or arenas - you have a pedal board - and you are looking for that sound that is gonna finally push your sound out front - give your notes clarity during leads - make overdriven chords ring.I like this pedal - it's on my board - and it's never coming off."
B000AKSUP2 Back in the 90's I used to have an Ampeg guitar head with an effects loop. I discovered the rack version of the BBE in a music store and was amazed by what it did for the money. The amp I have now is a totally bad ass Fryette Deliverance 120, but sadly it has no effects loop. So I thought I was out of luck as far as a BBE goes, because as far as I knew they were only available in rack mount units that could not be placed anywhere but in the effects loop. Then I was looking for pedals on Amazon and, lo and behold, there was a BBE Sonic Maximizer pedal! I snatched it up with a quickness and I am very pleased that it sounds just as good as the rack version. One caveat- if your signal is noisy the BBE can actually increase your signal noise. For this reason I highly recommend using top quality patch and instrument cables and doing all you can to clean up any noisy aspects of your sound before you use it. This pedal is very subtle, but to an audiophile like me it is absolutely essential. It also works great for ANY instrument or sound system. It's also great for vocals as well. But you may want the rack version for those applications. I would also buy the rack version if I had an effects loop to run it through. IMO, the pedal is really only for those folks who have no effects loop but still like what the BBE does. I'd go with the rack just for ease of use and keeping it in the proper place in the signal chain. Plus you can get a stereo rack version and have two BBE's for not much more money that you can use for another application."
B000ARH3M6 I have always loved Hercules products. Their mic stands and guitar stands. They are great quality and very handy, especially this one, for performances where 3 guitars are used."
B000ARH3M6 Sturdily holds three guitars. Fits everything from my bass, to the acoustic or electrics, to the mandolin/ukulele, to the harmonicas in the case.Folds up for transport. Pretty adjustable too.I bought this after buying two of the single guitar stands from Hercules. I also have the trombone and sax/clarinet stand from them. All A+ at reasonable prices."
B000ARH3M6 Apparently one can never have too many guitars, and with this stand you can keep three of them ready for immediate access.  Very stable.  The auto-locking heads rock!  Folds-up pretty compact for travel.  The optional carry bag is a must IMHO."
B000ARH3M6 A real workhorse for sure.  Not too heavy but still very robust and reliable when you are holding up expensive guitars.  I also have the 6 guitar one which is incredibly big ... almost too big but still easy to use once you get the hang of it."
B000ARH3M6 I've had this stand for about 5 years and have used it on stage for the last 3 years pretty steady.  The first thing that broke was the piece that keeps that upper shaft from pulling all the way out of the base when you extend it - the disclaimer here is that it was very cold and I immediately extended it to the maximum point always letting it hit the collar to stop it. It's plastic; Plastic and cold don't mix - The retainer piece broke and went flying and I was standing there with my guitar stand in two pieces right before a gig.  I managed to get it back together but now I have to be very careful when extending the neck. The other part that I've been having problems with is the upper collar that mounts to the top of the stand and holds the guitar necks.  It has come up completely off and I must continually tighten that hex screw to prevent the top from falling off.  I won't mark this stand less then 4 stars even with those issues because it really is a great stand.  Another person noted to pay attention to your guitar dimensions, which is very good advice.  Long bass guitars end up resting on the bottom leg of the tripod."
B000ARH3M6 This is my 2nd Hercules Stand. Great stand for managing multiple guitars. Does not fair well when stored in non cooled area. The handle gets real sticky and causes problems. I have a friend who also experienced the same problem. So keep it stored in climate controlled area and it is a great stand."
B000ARH3M6 Just got my stand today... the QUICKEST delivery EVER with the Super Savings free shipping selected that I have ever experienced!  Go go, Amazon!  lulz  Anyhoo, I have two banjos and a mandolin that I purchased this for.  I looked about for quite a bit at various sites, reviews, prices, etc, and pretty much Hercules got the best reviews everywhere (although admittedly I hadn't really wanted to shell out over 50 dollars).  Yet this tri-stand really looked good with a solid general review, and I am rather tight for spa
B000ARH3M6 If you are like me and truly value your (usually) expensive prized instruments, then you want to make sure nothing happens to them, accidentally or otherwise. The Hercules stands are much much more stable than all the rest. They have a better base design, and even when the stand inevitably gets bumped there is no wobbling, no worries - just make sure you lower it all the way, as it is designed to be.These things are awesome. Also, everything fits so perfectly on Hercules stands. All of the other tri-stands lean your instruments in toward the top too much and cause the headstocks to bang together. Not here, plenty of room for everything now. This stand (and the double version which I also own) lets your gear hang down perfectly straight and protects it all with those very thickly padded stops you see near the base in the picture. Also, the hanging gravity grasp around the neck is so sweet. With all other stands I am always worried that my guitar will slide off, or if it gets bumped that it could fall out. This mechanism holds it tight until you want it, and releases it very easily and naturally for you, but will not let it go while it's just sitting there. Check these things out, you will not be disappointed.Also, as for durability, I have used and abused my Hercules stand for years, tossing it around my car to play at different places. It's been tossed, dropped, setup and stowed many times and it still looks and works just like it did when I first bought it. It doesn't even have any obvious visible scratches on it (it came with a bag but I discarded it and never used it). Meanwhile, I had gone thru dozens of regular cheapo stands over the years before I bought the Herc. I will only every buy Herc stands from now on."
B000B6DHAS This is one of the cleanest sounding mini-amps you'll find.  Mine has no hiss or noise through the headphones.  It uses JFET components which get close to a tube amp sound.  It does sound tinny through the 2\" speaker, but AM radio sounded just as bad through 2\" speakers.  I hated it at first until I plugged in a set of headphones and turned down the O. Drive knob.  Very clean but I could get some character out of it by tweaking the guitar's volume knob.  Turning the O.Drive knob up just a bit adds some sparkle.  Of course you can get really distorted sounds from the amp.  I'm building a speaker cab with a Jensen 6\" speaker just for this amp.  According to many reports it will drive a 1x12 cab."
B000B6DHAS This tiny little amp is great for practicing outside or in a canoe or while hang gliding.  But it is not very good at parties.  it cannot compete with the noise level that 20 people in conversation can make.  It is cheap, so you should just get one.  I am having great fun experimenting around with different settings, instruments, and power feed voltage levels.  (see the danelectro power supply for this thing, really cool!)"
B000B6DHAS This little amp is exactly what my son needed for his acoustic guitar's output while playing outside on the porch. The amp produces a much \"bigger\" sound with much better quality than expected. This does eat up 9v batteries so we also picked up an AC power adapter for when he uses this in the houses.We also like that this has a headphone jack, which cuts the sound to the speaker when plugged in.Highly Recommend! Note: We have the \"Burgundy\" color one.CFH"
B000B6DHAS This is 10 watt walkman size guitar amplifier. The controls are Volume/ off, Tone, and overdrive. It also has a headphone jack. In my honest opinion, it is a good headphone amplifier to use when to need to practice without disturbing people around you. The speaker sound is fine for a clean sound ( like jazz, or country) or semi distorted and more (rock). If your looking for an small amp. that will do metal this may not be for you. Defintely get the Danelectro DA-1 AC power adapter instead of batteries because you may go through them quick. Overall it's pretty good."
B000B6DHAS If you are getting this amp only for portable practice and just want to hear what you are playing and do not care if it sounds great then you will be happy with this little amp.  It sounds surprisingly good for twenty bucks. I said good, not loud.  Loud enough, yes. I suggest buying a power brick so you can plug it in for daily home use because the batteries only last for about five hours of playing time.  This is a great little amp for camping, a quick lesson, or going to a friends house for a little jamming etc.. If you keep your expectations reasonable you will be pleased.  Great color and retro style as well."
B000B6DHAS i have been a gigging guitarist for over 50 years now.i own all the coveted amps/guitars/fxfor the last few years i have been doing an outside gig on the weekends in a small mountain tourist town.i've used all the roland cubes that are battery powered.they were just fine.on a lark, i bought this danelectro honeytone. i'd read some good reviews and $20.00 isnt much money.i was shocked. going guitar straight into the amp produces great clean and od tones. but in my gig i have been using a boss me-25 with all my presets for my set plus a boss rc-2 looper and lastly, my phone with all my backing tracks. i play rythm, leads and sing in my gig.i connected all this to the single input of the n-10, put volume 1/2 and tone the same. od turned off. the sound is rich, full and IMHO sounds just as good as my roland cube street ($299.00).i have all the volume i need and great tone. the 9v battery lasts the entire 2 hr set.i am AMAZED by this amp."
B000B6DHAS I use this amp for playing in my small apartment and it works great. The clean and distortion channels both sound good paired with the Danelectro Model 59 M."
B000B6DHAS After reading numerous reviews talking about the exceptional volume and tone of this amp, for the price (about $16-$17) I had to try it.When I plugged my acoustic into this, I was very pleased to find those reviews are accurate.  First, let's not expect $500 double 16&#34; sound from a portable 9v amp.  Once that reality is recognized, it's realized this puts out far better sound than one would ever expect from an amp this size and price.I would note that the sound you get out of this amp-- as with any amp-- will be directly relational to the quality of guitar and pickup you're feeding from.  I tried this on three different guitars and each one sounded significantly different.  One had very rich tone, another sounded &#34;tinny&#34;, another had a passive pickup and required I turn the HoneyTune up quite a bit more than the one with active pickup.  So it won't sound the same on every guitar.That said, if your guitar has good tone and your pickup is good, this amp is simply awesome.  I've had it only one day so I haven't put it through the test of time... but first-impressions are that I will buy more of these in the future (I need more than one portable amp).My sister visited and heard it right after I opened the box, and she was impressed as well.  Neither of us expected this kind of sound from such a small amp.  And I have to say, the aqua color is major retro.  Gotta luv it.I've been looking for &#34;the&#34; portable amp for some time.  This is the best I've found to date and the value for price is a perfect balance. I don't know as I'd pay the $40-$50 for this guitar shops often ask, but the Amazon price is perfect. : )One last thing:  Danelectro branded 9v battery included, same color as the amp. Priceless."
B000B6DHAS The Danelectro mini amp was an impulse buy for me, but this thing is fantastic! clean tones to woodstock fuzz, this thing belts 'em out. only complaint- battery doesn't last too long. get a power adapter. otherwise- GREAT PRACTICE AMP!"
B000B6DHB2 This little amp kicks major ass, dood. I think I may have blown the speaker or it's just how it sounds but it's great for a lo-fi kind of fuzz-e tone when the gain and levels are all the way up. The clean tone is really nice too, a little to bright for my taste, but for a mini-clip amp it's not too bad. I can take this plus my tele to my friends house and sit outside and just didtle away. Theres a headphon jack, a 9v power supply and that's in for plug ins, No line in so you can't plug you ipod or whatever to it and play along but oh well. If you have a big rig and you just want something small for like a camping trip with some friends this is pretty great."
B000B6DHB2 the mini amp did not arrive with the battery as it was stated in literature. good thing I had purchased the 9volt power adapter. I was really surprised at the output considering how small the speaker size. ideal for kicking aound house and small partyof friends. should already come with 9volt adapter with along cord. it would be worth the increase in price to have it come altogether. would purchase again,"
B000B6DHB2 TheDanelectro Honeytone Mini Amp - Beatnik Burgundyis an easy way to get great sound from your electric guitar. The color of this unit is a soft burgundy (almost brick red in color). Paired with the Zero Hum AC Adaptor, it's a highly portable amp setup. \"Ultra-portable\" by using a 9V battery instead of the AC adaptor. I do think they are best purchased together to enjoy all the benefits of this rig though.A headphone jack on the amp means you can enjoy the amp's impressive sound quality without bothering the neighbors or waking your spouse.Included with the amp is an Owner's Manual with simple start-up instructions. You'll need to have your own cord (the one that goes from the guitar to the amp isn't provided as part of the amp package...). The manual has several control settings for the following sound tweaks:-Clean & Spanky-Warm Jazz-Big Amp Overdrive-Killer Blues-Distorted Rhythm-Thick Solo-Woodstock Fuzz-Send the Cats Under the Bed-Twang-Mondo Sustain-Brit Solo Tune-Sparkle Clean-Early 80's Clean Solo-Late 60's Neck Solo-70's Brit-70's SoloI paid under $20 for this amp and couldn't be happier with the product. Don't hesitate to pick one up for yourself.UPDATE: 7/19/12There is a space in the back of the unit for 1 9-volt batteryDuracell 9-V Alkaline Batteries, 4-Countor you can use the included AC adapter to power the amp.UPDATE: 9/19/12 Per reviewer Paul Stewart: \"As a point of clarity - the current version of this item does NOT ship with an adapter nor cable. Be prepared to purchase these in tandem.\"  FYI...UPDATE: 11/17/13Almost 4 years ago I bought this item, and it's still going strong!  Great deal.UPDATE: 7/11/14YUP!  It's still kickin' along. Super buy on this mini-amp."
B000B6DHB2 Look, it's a plastic box that's just 5.5&#34; square and 2.5&#34; deep, with a cheap three-inch speaker inside. It produces decent sound, although there's substantial background hiss and it has a nasty habit of picking up digital &#34;static&#34; from my computer. It's OK as a practice amp, but I certainly wouldn't want to perform with it. In short, it's only a small step above toy level, which is what you'd expect for a twenty-dollar amp. That doesn't mean it's not useful, but you need to be realistic about what you're getting here."
B000B6DHB2 Brough this for trying \"electric\" feels on the acoustic guitar, and don't want to waste too much money on electric acoustic (preamp) guitar or big amp if I don't like the \"eFeels\". After researching awhile and reading tons of good reveiws of it, I decided to give it a try.  I didn't expect too much on $20 amp, but surprisingly, it positively gives me more than I ask for.  I also brough it with the adaptor, which is great to save $$ for long runs, and I don't have to worry about the battery for home practices.  It is adorable out of the box; it looks like a lovely toy, but it works professionally based on its 10w amp.  I don't care much about the manufactor's suggested modes, basically, I just fool around with the three button controls to whatever sounds I like in different songs on guitar / uke.  I like the small size that won't take too much space on my tiny room, it's cute to look at, and it is practical too!I had the high frequence of feedback as one of the reviwers when I used a poor pickup; however, when I changed to another one, I can turn the volume as high as I want with the same direction and setup as the previous poor pickup.  I almost thought that was an issue from the amp, luckily, I have two different pickups to try it deeply.  After using the better pickup, the amp doesn't have any issue yet.  I have used for few times, so I don't know about its longevity yet!One more thing about the headphone mode that is not completely silent because the guitar's sound itself won't be muted, but the headphone does mute the effected sounds from the amp; anyway, it's a great feature to have."
B000B6DHB2 I own one of these amps and it is capable of everything from very clean to heavy over-drive. I love it. It's got tone galore! I play either a Martin A/E thru it or a Strat knock-off.  Either one sounds awesome.  Never dreamed of such an enjoyable little amp, let alone for $20. Battery life seems OK, but I hate messing with batteries, so I'd buy power supply (you can get a 9V supply (check for proper polarity) at the Thrift store for a buck).  Don't even think about it.  Get it.  $20 is pocket change."
B000B6DHB2 This little amp is exactly what my son needed for his acoustic guitar's output while playing outside on the porch. The amp produces a much \"bigger\" sound with much better quality than expected. This does eat up 9v batteries so we also picked up an AC power adapter for when he uses this in the houses.We also like that this has a headphone jack, which cuts the sound to the speaker when plugged in.Highly Recommend!CFH"
B000B6DHB2 i knew it would be small but i wasn't thinking this small, ,it shore is cute,, good enough for now ,but not for the long-run,, shore its loud for the size but, it rattles when you turn it up and amps slides  from vibration,,if you keep it on lower sound its fine, this is only for temporary use for me. its an ok tiny mini little amp  (for it's size its good,) don't exspect a fender amp thats all,"
B000B6DHB2 For $20 you can't go wrong. Its a lot of fun to use this little amp for practice and it goes anywhere."
B000B6DHB2 Based on other reviews, I made my purchase. This is a great unit, it sounds good and loud enough.Two downsides, both are about the noise.1. I live on the 4th floor. As long as I turn the volume up, it acts like a radio.. I mean very loud radio background and I couldn't get ride of it. This is the only thing that annoys me, but I think it depends on where people live.2. When this is not properly tuned, it sounds strange and makes a lot of noise. (Other than the radio part.)None of these are major issues, as a mini amp you can't really expect that much, not to mention it's not expensive at all. Overall I like it and I would recommend it.By the way, this unit comes with a 9V battery."
B000B6DHB2 I got this when I was just learning how to play guitar.  I was using a borrowed First Act guitar without any amp and I wanted to see what kind of sounds I could make.  It was inexpensive and fun to use.  The sound quality isn't the greatest, but that's to be expected.  You can dial in quite a few different sounds and it comes with a sheet showing you how to make different sounds.  It's very light so make sure you set it on the floor because you will be pulling it over with the guitar cable.  I pulled it off the table a couple of times with no ill effects, but I wouldn't want to take any chances."
B000B6DHB2 this is the perfect amp for bed practice! i just plug near to me and practice when i like to practice, no heavy amps to move just plug and chill , not a great sound but is for practice not for concerts!nice item good purchase"
B000B6DHB2 Bought this for my son. Its perfect for practice. Great portability. Has a nice clean sound, as well as a decent overdrive sound. Sounds great with an electric acoustic. Its surprisingly loud for a small amp. You can't beat the price. I highly recommend this!"
B000B6DHB2 Sounds a lot more than what you expect, this is my 2nd Honeytone (one at home, one at work).  You can use it with batteries or with a 9V adapter, it has a clip to hang it on your belt or wherever you want, it also has a headphones input.  It gets way to distorted at high volume, but come on... it's a $20 amp; it does what it has to and does it well."
B000B6DHB2 This is a fun little practice amp about the size of a large sandwich. Three knobs, volume, tone and gain give it a little versatility. Runs forever on a nine-volt battery. I keep mine next to the couch so I can always plug in and have some fun. It's small but it can also be quite loud of you want it to be.Overall a great little deal for the price. Stop waiting and grab one, you can't go wrong."
B000B6DHB2 It's not going to win any awards for sound quality, but it sure is cute.  As you might expect, it's a pretty boxy sounding little amp, more reminiscent of 60's portable transistor radios than a double stack Marshall.  But it did the two things I wanted it for.  First, it has a belt clip, which I can attach to my belt or a guitar strap.  Second, it has a headphone out, so I can plug in a set of ear buds (1/8&#34; stereo jack).  You can get it to a clean decent practice room level if you keep the drive control set at minimum.  Surprisingly, the Drive control works it's way in gradually, letting you control the distortion a bit with the guitar volume control. With the drive control cranked up, you can get the amp unexpectedly loud, but terribly distorted.  For something you can throw in your guitar gig bag and take with you wherever you go, it's not too bad.  With a set of earphones, I would put it on par with some of the more expensive amp-jacks that are available.  If you plan to use it as a practice amp and you're not moving about, I would recommend getting a power supply (will use the same ones as most effects pedals).  Battery life appears to be around 3~5 hours, but the performance starts degrading at about an hour's use."
B000B6DHB2 I use this for a bass, and while I cannot get deep tones, it is great to take to the beachor play with my acoustic guitar friends.  Tip:  it sounds better if you don't cramp it all the way up - stop at 90%."
B000B6DHB2 I wanted a portable small sized amp for using my electric guitar outdoors -- but was not really in a position to pay the big dollars for one of the high end brands. There is of course, very little bass response with this one and it is a tad tinny, but hey, it's just a 9 volt battery. I just wanted the guitar audible for practicing outside and this is a very neat little device. They put a lot of thought into this amp, and it is outstanding for the budget price. Keep in mind, you can patch another 9 volt powered device through this one to enhance it -- I will at some point run my Boss Digital Delay box through it to check that out. The belt clip on the back and triple adjustment dials are nice, and I got it in red as a change of pace, because I always get &#34;black&#34; with my equipment. It looks very nice and the vintage front design gives it a lot of character. Nice product, Danelectro."
B000B6DHB2 I bought this amp as a back up for my 9 year old son and to take to the park... This is a nice little amp, it sounds prety good for the price. Just dont expect a booming base or grand sound from it."
B000B6DHB2 I buy and sell electric guitars and often I meet with someone at a half-way point where access to electricity is unavailable. I was surprised at the volume and tone that came out of a unit so small.  There is even and overdrive which makes this totally cool as some of my customers want to schredd a little.  This is battery operated but can be plugged in using an adapter.  I bought a Planet Waves 9V Power adapter to go with the Honey Tone.  It might work in a Busker situation."
B000B6DHB2 Don't get me wrong...this is a great little amp for practicing...but it eats batteries like they were candy. I think it was like 2 or three hours of playing and I had to throw in new batteries. But if playing on the street corner is your thing...this little amp has a belt clip."
B000B6DHB2 Ok I've owned 2 of these Danelectro amps. For one they are cheap in price, loud in output, and can be used as external speakers when attached to computers via wired or with purchase of a cheap Bluetooth adapter from ebay or amazon. Recently I purchased this item on ebay for $10 - Bluetooth Audio Music Receiver V3.0 Wireless Stereo Adapter For Smart PhonesNow I can connect to my tablets, smartphones, and computers and use this amp as a great external Bluetooth speaker.  Plus the battery life is great. Try to buy a BT speaker on amazon with this wattage that's cordless and works from battery power, and you will spend well over $200.The included battery is worthless and dies in about 5 minutes. I installed a 550mah rechargeable 9v battery (ebay) and it lasts forever.Plus I can still use it as a lower quality jam amp when I want... for this price its hard to beat."
B000B6DHB2 This micro amp is a real blast in more ways than one. And it is NOT a toy. Don't be misled by the price--this is a real amp based on stompbox electronics, and while it may not be a Marshall stack, it is more than adequate as a highly portable practice amp as well as a performance amp for small spaces. It is certainly loud hough to evoke complaints from my neighbors in adjoining apartments.I bought this amp for use durng harmonica practice. To this end, I use the belt clip to mount it on my hip. Then I just patch in my mike, twiddle the controls, and go to town. The tone has been fairly pure although, with a mike at least, I can also get some pops, crackles, and squeals. This is pretty typical for anyone amping a harp, so the Honey Tone is not at fault. In general, this amp is pretty forgiving of the input. I've used it with a high-impedance mike (Astatic JT-30), a low-impedance mike (Behringer XM8500), and electric guitar (Fender Stratocaster). It handles these without noticeable signal loss.What is this amp exactly? My guess is that Danelectric took the circuitry for its overdrive stompbox, added a 1-watt amplifier circuit, and put the whole shebang into a retro case. The result is quite appealing. And t
B000B6DHB2 I cant tell you how impressed i am with this mini amp, I was expecting some little amp with a somewhat of a sound, Instead I couldn't put it away, I must have played for at least a couple of hours in complete awe, The tones you were able to achieve with just a little knob adjustment was amazing,I would recommend this to anyone that needs a cheap amp, The 9v battery holds up well (which is surprising considering the drive you got off it)So spend the $20.00 and get something that is a real deal, I hope this helps with your decision about purchasing one"
B000B6DHB2 I wanted to like this. I really did. The idea of an amp this portable and cheap just made me think, &#34;Perfect&#34;. However, the unit I received was cr@p, and I'm going to assume it was defective and not blanket all the positive reviews with dispersions. The one I got kept cutting in and out. You might be playing a solo line and you might hear about 75% of the notes or something. And when holding a chord, the sustained sound would cut out after a few seconds. Frustrating.I did weigh whether or not to try a replacement unit. The so-so sound a
B000B6DHB2 I've tried several &#34;portable amps&#34;.  For the price, the HoneyTone can't be beat.  It has volume, tone and overdrive knobs (the overdrive can go way too over, so easy on that one).  Comes with a battery but can be connected to a 9v adapter (important note: reverse polarity, negative central).  Interestingly I have found this amp seems to work significantly better with acoustic-electrics or piezo-based pickups better than magnetic pickups.  But for a small, portable, light-weight practice amp which one can hook to a belt and attach an earphone... they don't come much better.  It has a belt clip on the back but you'll have to supply your own earphones and 9v adapter if you want them.  Battery is included. Of course a guitar cable is a required extra.Well worth the money."
B000B6FBA2 I'm giving this one 5 stars, with the caveat that you MUST GET THE SILVER ALUMINUM one, otherwise the black thermoplastic ones do break. The thermoplastic ones broke on me within 2-3 months of use, 3 different ones, until I got the silver one which has not had that problem. Every music store I go to locally has the black thermoplastic ones, and they look in disbelief at me when I say they break. But they did --if I leave it on the guitar on a fret for 5 or 10 minutes and go into the kitchen to make tea, the thing literally snaps and breaks into 2 or 3 pieces and goes airborne at high speed in 2 pieces, and could poke someone's eye out in a public performance, freaky. There's something about the rainy days higher humidity cool damp air pressure and/or temperature fluctuation that does it.I live in northern california, so I don't know if a dry climate like the southwest would not have that problem.The SILVER ALUMINUM ONE by contrast, hasn't broken in now nearly a year of use, and shows no hints of doing that. It feels different in the hand from the thermoplastic-- no hint of plastic, but it is very light and not heavy like the G7 ones are. I made sure to order the silver aluminum one through Amazon, since the description on the black ones say some are aluminum and some thermoplastic, and I only want to make sure I get the aluminum one.The silver aluminum Planet Waves capo really is the best capo I've ever had, super easy to use, very easy to put on and switch from one fret to another while you're going from playing one song to another (you don't have move your body or the guitar like you do with all other capos to put it on or move it, which is a spectacular design), it keeps the strings in tune better than most other capos, and it's out of the way of your hands, doesn't interfere when you play any chord. The screw adjustment is in the perfect place for the least strain and doesn't hurt the fingers when turning it. It's the least obtrusive and best capo ever. I'll also add that I have an old carpal injury so I want the least strain, and small hands, so I want the least awkward and most light capo, and this does that. I absolutely love it, and I'm glad that the aluminum ones are durable."
B000B6FBA2 Nice design... Small, lightweight and very easy to use, dose the job well. I am thinking about getting a 2nd one."
B000B6FBA2 This inexpensive capo works as advertised. It's the plastic version of the more expensive metal one but it works as advertised and is ideal for a light weight backup."
B000B6FBA2 I'm happy with this purchase. I bought it during the Black Friday sale. It works for what I use it for. When not in use, it just gets put away. Doesn't take a lot of space."
B000B6FBA2 Purchased this capo after having a bad experience with a spring style capo.  This capo was just perfect for my needs."
B000B6FBA2 In 40 years I have had every kind of capo out there. This is the right one. This one works. Buy one for each of your guitars and keep them in the case: they are well made and inexpensive enough."
B000B6FBA2 It is really good to have one of this to change the tone of the songs to make it easy to play!"
B000B6FBA2 It does a good job for it's primary purpose as a capo so I gave it four stars.  It works flawlessly, but the one minor annoyance is that it doesn't easily stay on the head of the guitar except above the nut where if you screw it a bit tight it could mess with the tuning of the guitar.  With clamp on capos you can just clamp them on the wood."
B000B6FBA2 Pretty darn good in every way. Trim and easy to use. Solid construction. I recommend this capo without reservation. I like it and it is small."
B000B6FBA2 This is a fantastic little capo.  I say little because it is not as big as the spring loaded type, of the Shubb capos I've used.It has a low profile, and I can reach right up to it and still play well.It seems to be sturdy and well constructed, and I love that I can easily adjust how much tension to put on the strings.  Just enough so they don't buzz and then the strings will stay in tune when the capo is off.Much cheaper than the G7th, and does the job just as well in my opinion.For everyone saying that you can't fit it on the neck, make sure you get the right capo!  If you have a classical guitar, get a classical capo!  If you have a guitar with a really thin neck get the lite model capo.  If you are like most people who have regular size guitar necks, get the normal one.Don't write bad reviews of the product because you bought the wrong kind."
B000B6FBA2 I love this capo better than any I have seen or used. Great quality and price. You wont go wrong with this capo."
B000B6FBA2 I don't have a classical guitar, but I just got an inexpensive but really fun steel string guitar with a non-radiused fingerboard.  I've also got over a dozen capos (don't ask!) but all are for radiused fingerboards.The fingerboards of most steel-string guitars--electric and acoustic--are radiused, that is, they are not flat.  They have a gentle curve to them, so gentle that many wouldn't notice it unless they looked closely. Look up \"fingerboard\" in the Wikipedia for an excellent discussion and Google images for diagrams and pictures.Even though the curve is gentle, if a fingerboard is radiused, a capo must be curved, too, or the outside strings would not be pressed down properly and would buzz.  If a fingerboard is flat, like a classical guitar's, the capo must be flat, too, or the center strings will not be pressed down properly and will buzz.If you're not sure whether your guitar's fingerboard is radiused, slide a ruler between two frets.  If it lies flat, then so is the fingerboard.  If it rocks, the fingerboard is radiused.I REALLY like this capo because of the way pressure is adjusted by turning the tension screw.  This makes it possible to exert just the right amount of pressure--not tool little, which would cause strings to buzz, and not too much, which would cause the instrument to go out of tune.As others have noted, its one drawback is that it can't be clamped to the headstock when not in use.  But for that, I'd replace most of my capos with radiused versions of this capo.  HIGHLY recommended!"
B000B6FBA2 My eleven year old guitar player is very happy with this capo. It's easy for him to use and adjust."
B000B6FBA2 Love this capo on my electric guitar.  I can adjust the tension for any position on the neck very easily.  Tried other more expensive capos, but this one is the Winner!"
B000B6FBA2 In this price point - it's a good capo - if you know how to put one on and use it. I use it for lessons in case a kid steals it - so I'm not losing my G7 capo which was $40. Great capo."
B000B6FBA2 The only instrument this works well on is my Yamaha guitarelele which has nylon strings, for steel strings I want more pressure, I advise getting the NS Capo that is not \"lite\",  I prefer that one above this model."
B000B6FBA2 You have to turn the knobs every time you want to use this. What a pain. Oh well, it was cheap enough to have around."
B000B6FBA2 This is an awesome capo!  It's sleek, light,easy to install (you can do it with one hand) and looks nice on the instrument.  I use the NS capo on my Gibson SG Special faded and it does exactly what it is supposed to do.  I love the dial, it's very easy to use and lets me set it to the just the right amount of pressure where I can still bend the strings but there is no fret buzz.  Awesome product, much better than using a Kyser that puts your guitar out of tune and leaves gouges in your neck.  Sounds great on my SG and my acoustic.For those of you wondering yes it does clamp on the headstock if you tighten it down enough.  I think it also depends on the width of your headstock but it works for me."
B000B6FBA2 There's nothing not to like about this capo.  I have two of them.  I've played guitar for over 40 years and have used other types of capos.  I like this one's low profile and the fact that you provide the pressure to the fretboard (by turning a knob to tighten it) rather than rely on a spring, as on the clip-on type. It takes a few seconds longer to install than the clip-on type, but I like the results better."
B000B6FBA2 Was not sure about this one but it is darn easy to use and works quite well.  I still use the Kayser for most stuff but this is great for a backup."
B000B6FBA2 We ordered one, it worked so nicely, we ordered 2 more.  You can adjust the tension precisely to fit your guitar, and minimize string stress and de-tuning each time you move your capo.  Very nice product."
B000B6FBA2 This is a very nice product to use.  I would recommend it to anyone. It is small enough to be out of the way while playing."
B000B6FBA2 Great item!Sturdy, had it for a few weeks now. Small, light, durable. Holds the strings down perfectly too Great capo!"
B000B6FBA2 These are nice, easy to use capos and the price was great.  I got several of them to use during my guitar class, when someone doesn't have a capo and needs one."
B000B6FBA2 Works well, arrived fast. No problems. Works as described. A good purchase for a low priced capo.Works for acoustic and electric"
B000B6FBA2 I purchased a Classical guitar and only had a traditional (steel string) Capo available to me. Not thinking it through I used it on my Nylon Stings and after a few times I realized it had damaged the string to the point they had to be replaced. Along with my string order I added this Capo so it does not happen again.Pros:It's small and lightweight.It's very well made. It not  only looks great but also appear to be of high quality.It's very adjustable. Unlike my steel string Capo, this uses a screw/knob to tighten, not spring loaded. This allows you to finely tune the capo to add just enough pressure to bar the fret but not damage the stings.It works on steel strings. Yep, I found my self needing a Capo on another guitar and only having this with me, I saw no reason it should not work so I gave it a try and it performed wonderfully. I won't be using it full time on my steel strings, but great to know in a pinch I have use it.If you need a great capo thats gentle on your Nylon strings then this is the one to get."
B000B6FBA2 I always seem to have to re-tune with the spring loaded capo's.  Rarely have to re tune with this one.  Highly recommend."
B000B6FBA2 I ordered one of these because I like my other Planet Waves Capo a lot (I believe its the older metal version of this, not the &#34;Lite&#34;). However, this one just does not screw down enough to hold down the strings, especially down at the lower frets where the neck is a little thinner (on a Martin jumbo acoustic). It will barely bend the strings down behind the fret but not enough to prevent buzzing. Your fretting hand will naturally push the capo back and out of position quite easily when playing open chords too.I'm not sure why the plastic version has this issue when it appears to have an identical design to the old metal one. It doesn't seem defective as no parts are bent or missing as far as I can tell. Unless I just happen to get one with a shorter than normal screw, I wouldn't recommend it for any guitar without a thick neck.My recommendation is the classic Kyser capo thats more dependable and quicker to apply and remove (it also attaches to your headstock effortlessly when not in use). If you are looking for the screw-down style, I would look for the older version of this and avoid the &#34;Lite&#34;."
B000BBRZ3S A Little History:I have been a guitar player for forty-odd (some of them, VERY odd) years.  For the first thirty of them, I tuned by ear - starting by guessing at what a low E sounded like, then tuning the other five strings by fretting, listening and tuning.  I could never understand why the tuning often sounded perfect for one chord, yet remained `off' for others... it took quite a long time to get it right.  Then, about ten years ago, I thought I had figured it out.  The problem (I thought) was that my guesses at a true \"E\" were off - so I got myself an \"E\" tuning fork (320 cycles) and used it to tune the first string.  Then, I did as I had always done - fretted and tuned the other five. Not much better as a result - kept having to tune and retune for quite a while to get all chords to sound right.  During those years, I tried tuning all six strings to (what I believed was an accurately tuned) piano as well as by ear to tones available online.  Nothing gave me better tuning on the first try.  Then, I saw an ad for a Chromatic Tuner and lightening struck.The Realization:There have been many -  each of which has led me closer to what I have now - near perfect tuning on the first go `round!  First off, I realized that when we say \"E\", that is not just one note.  It is a range of literally hundreds - perhaps even thousands- of specific tones.  The same is true for every note.  This is akin, I guess, to the realization as a child, that no matter how many shades of `blue' are in a box of crayons, the chanced of having the precise shade you want for a specific drawing are rare.  Purchasing my first Chromatic Tuner (a CT440, manufactured by SwitchMucic and sold through MusiciansFriend.com) moved me a long way along the continuum of learning and accurate tuning.  However, that tuner had at least two limitations. Firstly, it's construction is rather light and flimsy - it works OK, but has a second limitation that conaused me to buy the Korg (for about the same price)  That is that the Korg has a built in tone generator and speaker allowing the option of tuning that way rather than having only the single option of having tones made by the instrument read and metered back to you.  Both tuners have plug-in for electric instruments, and, so far as I can tell, their accuracies are similar.  I prefer the Korg for the reasons I have mentioned.  Additionally, the Korg can be manually recalibrated for special tuning needs - and `remembers' the original tuning/tones so you can return to it for more `standard' usage. A nice, extra piece of flexibility. The LCD meter is easy to read and colored lights tell you, right away, whether you are sharp, flat (and by how much!) or right on!As a point of surprising interest, the tuning fork I had used for years turns out to be profoundly FLAT! A shock to me - given that I had grown up learning that tuning forks gave off perfect tones! I have saved it as a reminder that all things are not what they are promoted to be. I guess the round pitch pipe that Ms. Sweeny used to tune up the class in the 5th grade was probably not quite as precise as she would have presumed!And Finally:This is a marvelous little (and inexpensive) device - well constructed, accurate and flexible to allow for many different tuning need situations and circumstances.  I assume that there will be still higher places for my `learning curve' in this area to rise to - but for right now, this is it.  I am using it, regularly, on all my stringed instruments (two six-string Martins, a twelve string Epiphone and a frailing banjo.  The time it saves tuning the 12-string alone makes it more than it's own price!)If you have not discovered Chromatic Tuning (maybe I really WAS the last one to discover these things!?), I suggest you do so immediately and spend your time enjoying the pleasures of making music rather than sitting in frustration trying to adjust the tunings by ear so it sounds `really' right. Perhaps people with `perfect pitch' can do very nicely without a Chromatic Tuner - I am not one of them. Are you?"
B000BBRZ3S It is inexpensive but is difficult to use  anywhere with other noise..I used it for several years but it is only a backup now.. Nice part is that you can calibrate the tuning, although probably would not be used by most musicians.. Other than that I think money would be better spent on a headstock type tuner.. I would not recommend it."
B000BBRZ3S This is a nice little tuner. It is small, easy to read and use. It has a non-backlit LCD display of an analog VU style meter, with extra marks at plus and minus 20 cents, and red LEDs that light when a tone is sharp or flat. It has a green LED and large mark for being on target. It has a built-in mic for acoustic instruments, and a mono 1/4 inch phone jack for electric instruments. It has an active tone you can switch on for tuning, but that is only adjustable over the narrow range of 410-480hz. It uses a pair of AAA size batteries that you pop the whole case open to change. If you have any vision problems, the display might be an issue. The LCD is about 1 1/2 inches long and 3/4 of an inch high, and, like all non-backlit LCD displays, has a narrow viewing angle and reflection issues.I wanted this for tuning didgeridus that I was making, and it works adequately for that. The one thing it is lacking that disappointed me is a frequency or octave readout. As it is, it gives you the note and cents sharp or flat, but does not give an octave number or frequency of the sound. So, you know you are tuned to a C, you just don't know exactly which C it is. Probably not much of an issue if you are tuning a regular instrument, but in some cases would be very handy to know. I suppose with more training and experience, I could learn to tell that by ear. (What? Learn a skill! Isn't that asking a bit much?)I suppose for an inexpensive tuner, that is the trade-off, but it does detract from the usefulness of this tuner for my purposes. Other than that, it seems to work well. It is consistent, easy to use, and compact. I consider it about average in value - it does the basics well but is missing what I consider an important function in such a device. I may be expecting too much for the price, as I have not done an exhaustive study of tuners and their specs. Having the octave feature would make it 4 stars for me instead of three.In any case, if you don't need to know the actual octave or frequency but just the accuracy of the notes you are tuning, this works quite well, and is not very expensive."
B000BBRZ3S What can I really say! Tunes my entire arsenal.From. Cigar Box Guitar, 3 string Strummers, Tacoma Papoose, andmy brand new Laguna 6 string..Getting ready to make few Uke's and it will Tune them also..Need a all n one Tuner, buy this or an I-Phone? The Korg is the perfectTuner.."
B000BBRZ3S I've had two of these tuners. They are well known among bass instrument players for being able to lock in on the lowest pitches better than most other tuners. They're durable and have a long battery life. Unlike most other tuners, in noisy environments they don't lock in on higher pitches before lower ones, again a plus for low instrument players.The one problem that I've had with these tuners is that one of them had to be set to A-439 to tune pitches that other tuners recognized as A=440. Strange."
B000BBRZ3S this tuner is easy to use.  I like that it has the input jack for electric guitar as well as acoustic.  It makes it so much easier.  this is my first tuner in a long time and I'm please with it."
B000BKY8CU Excellent Product, it is well cushioned. I'm a typical overweight American. Great Sale Price!(Lucky Timing) All Black and fully Assembled! Doesn't get any easier than that... (Batman)"
B000BKY8CU I bought this bench on an Amazon Warehouse Deal so that I could get it on Prime delivery and was not disappointed at all. The bench is very sturdy and comfortable - the cushioning is thick and soft. The item arrives flat packed and can be adjusted to the correct seating height in seconds. This bench is just what I was looking for and I'm sure it will serve its purpose for many years."
B000BKY8CU I actually like this bench a lot. It fits into my gear back (rolling duffle style) that contains my cables / power strips etc., with only the folded legs sticking out of the bag. I have the KT7800, which is much larger seat area, and easier to adjust. Depends on your preference I suppose, this one is smaller / lighter, the other is larger / easier to adjust."
B000BKY8CU The Keyboard Bench is lower than I anticipated.  The seat is very soft and comfortable.  However, it doesn't appear to hold anyone with excess weight."
B000BKY8CU It has a comfortable seat and seems stable and well-made.  However, if you need to haul it around frequently, it takes a bit of time to set up and screw down or open up the screws that hold the moving stability bar on the bottom of the seat. Also, if you need to adjust the height, you have to remove the entire bolt assembly seen at the crossing point of the bars, and then select one of three holes that are only an inch or some apart from each other.  So, not much selection there."
B000BKY8CU For me, I can click this in so it is a nearly perfect height. The padding is great, it is lightweight without feeling cheep."
B000BKY8CU I bought this for my daughter who plays the keyboard. It was already assembled right out of the box, and seems well padded and sturdy. My daughter likes it. I like the price because of the special deal from Amazon."
B000BKY8CU This assembled in just a couple of minutes without the need to refer to the instructions. The bench is comfortably padded and very affordable."
B000BKY8CU It isn't top of the line but it gets the job done. I wouldn't abuse of the chair too much though, the material looks a little floosy."
B000BKY8CU I'm a heavier fellow (5'11, 220) and some of the harder benches I've tried were a tad uncomfortable for long sessions. This one, on the other hand, is very comfortable and has plenty of padding and support. It folds up easily and looks to be very well made. 5 stars, no complaints, and much nicer than a lot of the more expensive options."
B000BKY8CU The price is a great selling point, just by itself.  I use it with my acoustic guitar and the On Stage FS7850B Guitar Foot Rest that I bought off Amazon as well.  It's a good combo.  It leads me to playing for longer periods.  It's solidly constructed.  It folds and is definitely portable.  Great buy."
B000BNSYHW I bought this to restore the neck of an Ibanez that I had ordered used and knew needed TLC.After a few coats of this stuff the neck looked/played/felt like it was just out of the factory! It restored years of neglect in just a few minutes.When I bought this I though it wouldn't be enough. BOY WAS I WRONG. I'll have enough of this oil to last me awhile which makes me happy because I can get that new guitar feel out of my neck for months if not years to come."
B000BNSYHW got this to treat my fretboard on my guitar. Nice airline-sized bottle w/ safety cap to prevent from unintentional opening. Replenished my dried out fretboard to like-new condition."
B000BNSYHW I needed some fretboard cleaner. This is something I had not tried before. I used it and I like it."
B000BNSYHW Has a nice smell, works like a charm. This bottle will probably last me 10 years. Good cheap price...a recommended purchase."
B000BNSYHW This has a nice smell, and is good for maintaining the wood on the neck of your guitar. Best used when replacing strings, so you can apply while the strings are off."
B000BNSYHW Clean really good of prints and smell very nice. My first time using it but like it alot since it works good."
B000BNSYHW Nice quality fretboard oil. Has a nice scent to it, and remember a little goes a long way. I would definitely recommend this. Worked nice on my maple unfinished fretboard."
B000BNSYHW I maintain all of my guitars on a regular basis since I no longer have my own guitar tech to do everything for me! Take care of your fretboards any your fingers and fretboards will be very happy!"
B000BQTCDO This is an iconic fuzz pedal.  Yes, Smashing Pumpkins used this pedal but Corgan also used a Fender Blender (which is similar to the Big Muff but has an octive thing going on too).  This is not a subtle pedal.  It's cuts through the mix well if you are running into a cleanish amp.  I find that it gets a little muddy if I run it into an amp that's already breaking up.  I can say the same thing about most fuzz pedals though.  This is not a wooly, splattery vintage tone like the Dunlop Fuzz Face.  It really has it's own thing going on.  It's not the kind of pedal that I keep on all the time, but it's a cool tool for the sonic toolbox.  If I had it to do all over again I would likely buy the Big Muff with the tone wicker switch.  It's about ten bucks more and has a little more tweekability."
B000BQTCDO i feel strange giving this classic only 3 stars.  but it's just not for me.  it's large and takes up space on my pedal board.  i prefer the little big muff"
B000BQTCDO I have played through this for over 15 years and I will tell you right now, get a big amp. Get 2 amps and split the signal, even. You want to have the biggest amp you can when using this pedal. Otherwise it will come off sounding frail instead of \"Frail and Bedazzled\".Otherwise this pedal conjures up a beastly reference, and it should. I have been in a couple bands where I just plugged this into the amp and played my riffs. The free drinks and loose women followed shortly thereafter.If you're looking for stinging yet rumbly fuzz, this is the pedal you need. I only wish it went up to \"11\"."
B000BQTCDO I owned this pedal for many years, before finally trading it in on some other equipment.  It produces one sound extremely well, but it only does that one thing.  The sound it does very well is the late 60's/early 70's fuzz sound: \"White Room, Black Curtains\"; \"Satisfaction\"; \"Ina Gadda da Vida\".  Note:  this pedal produces very good sustain, but has really bad attack.  As such, it will not really do the \"Whole Lotta Love\" sound.  As I said, it does one thing very well, but its range even with classic rock is quite limited.  If you plan to cover songs with that classic fuzz sound, this pedal gets you 100% of that sound.  If you want to also cover other classic rock, you're gonna need at least one more overdrive/distortion effect."
B000BQTCDO I cannot express how over sized this pedal is - it's ridiculously big and it's unnecessary.if you are lacking space on your pedal board u may want to look elsewhere or retrofit the insides into a smaller housing as i will do.Again - please be aware of the dimensions - this thing is soooooooooooooo hugeit sounds good though - though it does rob tone"
B000BQTCDO It's noisy, but if you find out how to equalize the tone and volume, it works fine. I bought it cause Gilmour uses this effect but certainly the one he uses must be of a much more better quality product."
B000BQTCDO This pedal does exactly what my title suggests... it creates a huge walk of smooth rich fuzz... very smashing pumpkins feel to this. It doesn't do many different tones, but what it does it does very well! And frankly, once I find a good tone out of a pedal, I don't change it often anyhow! This is an amazing value, and a welcome party of my pedal boards. (P.S.: I have the Russian variant...)"
B000BU5V58 We opted for the World Tour \"Guitar Gig Bag\" over a hard case because most of the time my son's guitar is hanging on the wall usingString Swing Hardwood Home & Studio Guitar Hanger (Shades May Vary). This case is generally good quality and meets our needs, with the following observations:Pros -+ Lightweight; doesn't add a lot of pounds but still protects the guitar+ Good Quality; strong material, stitching, and zippers+ Storage Pockets; big enough for music pages, picks, and a small electronic tuner+ Handles; good hand grip handle on the side and has well padded adjustable packpack strapsCons -- Limited Protection; this is not a hard case and it will not provide much protection from a serious impact- Appearance; this is not awe-inspiring to look at, being very basic and the \"World Tour\" logo looks a little \"cheesy\"This was a good choice for the limited, light use it gets from us.Recommended!CFH"
B000BU5V58 This is a fine bag for a guitar, I got it for my brother...I'm not a music person but its good"
B000BU5V58 I don't know who would need better unless you traveled a lot where you might need the hard case.  This one surpassed my expectations.Months into using the Gig Bag and not a single problem.  The pockets are packed with books, tools, and strings.The shoulder straps make carrying the bag across town a breeze."
B000BU5V58 A great universal bag. I can put everything in this bag from my 12 string to my hollow body. Has great pockets to carry your picks, strings, and tuners. The padding is better that I expected. It does have a red strip on this if your concerned about color."
B000BU5V58 Arrived on schedule.  Sturdy, with adequate padding to protect my &#34;babies&#34;.  Three zipper pockets to hold cords, mics, capos and tuners as still have room for keys and combs.  I own several gig bags, and this is my favorite."
B000BU5V58 Received item when promised, fits great for my Yamaha Acoustic Electric, but carry with care, remember Acoustics are hollow body and can bust if dropped, great zipped pockets."
B000BU5V58 This case is very durable, nice heavy duty zippers and pockets for storage. The 20mm is perfect to protect instrument during travel. The red piping in the picture is more maroon in real life."
B000BU5V58 I bought a Hollowbody without a case and wanted a gig bag in case I decided to take it anywhere. The prices of the other bags ranged from more than double this one to almost four times. I have other guitars and they all have cases and I might never actually take this guitar anywhere so I didn' twant to spend a lot. Price was a big issue. The guitar fits great. The bag is well padded and I can't believe the price."
B000BU5V58 I purchased this for my daughter who is 10.  She is learning to play guitar and needed a bag to protect the new guitar I bought her.  This bag has plenty of storage, offers good protection and the guitar fit perfectly.  I am going to purchase another one for my guitar."
B000BUDO48 Decent quality.  Cheap price.  We'll see how long it lasts.  But, for now, does the trick.  I think the odds of be becoming rich and famous have increased because of this stand."
B000BUDO48 This is a very good and stable stand. Light, strong, and very balanced. It makes my guitar feel secure. It is also ideal for travel since when folded can just be slipped into a small bag."
B000BUDO48 This is my favorite light weight guitar stand, simple and does the job.  I try to avoid the stands with lever locking mechanisms at the neck rest which are a pain in the arse when you are trying to switch guitars on the fly.  These are lightweight and collapsible so you can take them anywhere, and are sturdy enough for 'normal' use.  If you're a klutz no guitar stand will be sufficient unless it is encased in carbonite."
B000BUDO48 I have my 12 string on this stand when I'm taking a break from practicing (as you know, a case is where you should store your guitars, not on a stand). It is easy to assemble. You'll pay a lot more money for stands that do the job just as well as this one. if you're gigging, I might suggest a higher priced stand, but for occasional travel and home use, this will do the trick."
B000BUDO48 This guitar stand does NOT find hidden treasure. It does NOT hypnotize beautiful women. It does NOT fix your transmission. It does NOT tell your boss to give you a raise.It just holds onto your guitar when you don't see any reason to put into a case. It's sturdy, reliable and to the point. No gimmicks, nothing flashy. Just a guitar stand that is reasonably priced. If you need one, might as well be this one."
B000BUDO48 I bought 3 of these because of the ridiculously low price...I figured I'd get my money's worth from them regardless.  They work fine.  So well, that I thought I would buy a few more for the studio.  The price went up nearly 50% on them though.  BAH."
B000BUDO48 There are a fair number of similar tripod guitar stands out there for about the same cost.  If one of your pet peeves with some of these is that the U-shaped support falls out when you carry the assembled stand around, then you'll especially like the World Tour stand.  The way that the U-shaped piece inserts makes it far less susceptible to falling out. And, although it is, as one other reviewer put it, \"minimalistic,\" this stand has a substantial feel to it.  I'm quite happy with this purchase, and would buy another World Tour again, rather than one of the other brands that I own.  Amazon.com did a great job, too, getting this out to me."
B000BUDO48 This stand is very nice, it is black and it does its job very well. It also has a strap on the top holder to secure the guitar when it is on the stand. It is like an added bonus."
B000BUDO48 I've bought quite a few guitar stands off of Amazon in the past few years, and I've paid for the most expensive ones and the cheapest ones, and this is the best one I've found yet. Very sturdy, well made, and fully height adjustable, with strong soft foam to protect your precious guitars from getting all scratched up. It states that cellulose finishes can be damaged, so at least it lets you know that ahead of time(most cheap stands don't), so that's a good thing as well. Don't waste more money than you have to for a good quality stand, grab this one!"
B000BUDO48 This seems like a nice product, but maybe I'm doing something wrong.  I can't get the bottom guitar support to lock in place.  It twists around and that makes it a little hard to put the guitar in place.  Maybe there is something I need to do differently?"
B000BUDO48 I got two of these for my electric bass and rhythm guitars.  Great little stands at a great price.  They are sturdy, easy to assemble and adjustable.  I'd suggest this to anyone needing a guitar stand."
B000BUDO48 I ordered two of these stands and they work very well! Definitely keeps my guitars a lot safer than having them leaning against things."
B000BUGNNM Case  arrived in great condition.Quite Roomy, fits my Vendetta AND/Or my Les Paul - Two exterior pockets for tools, extras, etc.2x Thicker padding than the Epiphone gig bag I got for the LP, but all these have to do is protect and keep dust away - I'm not hauling them to shows...Get One."
B000BUGNNM Nice bag with great features. It is slightly large for a Telecaster or Stratocaster but works fine for either.I actually swapped another bag, putting a Les Paul Jr in this one and a Tele in the Gibson bag as theGibson bag was a really tight fit for the LP JR. headstock."
B000BUGNNM I am deployed to middle east and beat my guitars up pretty good.  I have 3 World Tour bags to keep my axes safe!  Nice padding, nice features."
B000BUGNNM This is a great gig bag for the money. It has more padding than I thought it would have, has very strong construction, and plenty of places to store stuff like sheet music and cables. The carry handle and shoulder straps are well padded and comfortable to use as well. It's even reasonably water proof, handling the light rain shower well with zero leaks. For the money, this is the best one I've bought on Amazon, and will certainly buy it again in the future. Highly recommended!"
B000BUGNNM I have an ESP guitar with a slanted headstock that had a hard time fitting into the gig bag that the music store threw in when I got the guitar. After buying a line-6 pocket pod and some good studio headphones there was simply no room left in that old bag.Found this bag and liked the fact that it has so many front pockets and it really looked like it would fit all of my gear, cables, etc. I originally put it on my wish list because I will admit, you don't always want to spend your own money on stuff like this but my wife ended up surprising me with this and it was a great surprise.My guitar fits perfectly. It used to be a struggle getting my guitar in the old gig bag and zipping it shut. As mentioned, the curved headstock makes the guitar taller and the old gig bag always had the pointed tip of the headstock poking out of it because it just would not close.But this big closes all the way and it does have so much more padding than my previous bag. And the pockets - OH THE POCKETS! They fit ALL of my gear. I have my guitar cable, a set of full size sennheiser headphones, a line 6 pocket pod, all the allen wrenches, a tuner, and my tremelo neatly organized in all the separate pockets. And there is room for more if I need it!The bag does smell a little funky the first few days but it didn't stink up the house like some reviewers mentioned. Just open it up and let it air out in a part of the house where it won't bother anyone and it's fine after a day or two.One last thing about this bag is that it has a handle right up near the headstock. I did not know this but wow I had no idea how useful that could be. I tend to carry my guitar, in bag, up and down stairs a lot and being able to hold it in two places is extremely useful. Then you have the backpack handles as an option as well. I really cannot recommend this bag enough. I do agree with the other user who said the log on it is a little kiddie like, but I don't really care, the bag is too perfect for me to be bothered by that, and while the padding is great, I would not recommend this bag for checking your bag for air travel. It would be fine if you use it as a carry on but would not protect much in checked baggage, in case you want it for that kind of thing. I don't travel long distances with my guitar but if I did, I would use a hard case only for that as I have seen too many horror stories of smashed guitars on airlines lately.Hope that helps anyone out there looking for a gig bag with tons of room for your gear!"
B000BUGNNM This bag is well padded, has backpack straps to carry comfortable, and several pockets to hold cable, extra strings, picks, and much, much more. For the price, I feel like it is a steal. Some people complain about the smell. It kind of smells like motor oil. It is strange, but being I have been around that smell so much, it doesn't bother me. Be warned about it though."
B000BUGNNM Got this for an SG-style guitar, and it fits with plenty of room.  This is a better quality bag than an &#34;average&#34; bag, but with a couple of comments:1.  It smells like an industrial rubber factory upon opening.2.  The large, main zipper is easy to close but somewhat difficult to unzip.  Surprised me because it's a large-toothed zipper.3.  Construction seems to be pretty good.  This is not a hard case, but to get a guitar from point A to B, it works just fine.4.  Padding is sufficiently thick.  It's not a paper thin bag, but it's not thick enough that the guitar would survive a drop.Would I get another one?  Probably, as long as the use was long term storage or to travel small distances.  Otherwise, I'd get a soft sided hard case (the new wave of Styrofoam cases) or a regular old hard sided case."
B000BUGNNM I have seven of these that I use on my Ibanez AM73's, but they are perfect for anyAM series guitars (like the 93).The bag is well padded, and not to expensive.It seems it is always on back order which tells me they are very popular.The dimensions are: 41\"L, 14\"W at Bout, and 3\" Deep. It has two large zippers; the head zipper goes all the wayaround, and the bout zipper stops before entering the bottom area which is the ONLY draw back to thisgig bag, as with ALL deeper guitars, you want the bottom (bout) zipper to at least complete the bottom areato make placing and removing easier.This is the best gig bag I have found in the last few years for the smaller bout guitars that does not cost too much."
B000BUGNNM This is a great bag, regardless of cost. The fact that it sells for less than $20 makes it an absolutely fantastic deal. (Free shipping only makes it that much better.) Unlike some other reviewers, I have not noticed any objectionable smell. I will attest to the fact that it is very well constructed. The fabric itself is a heavy cordura material, the zippers and pulls are heavy duty too, and the padding is stiff and thick enough to afford your (solid body) guitar some very substantial protection. (I would estimate the padding, which is entirely concealed within the cordura, to be approximately three-quarters of an inch thick.) In addition to the main carry handle at the side, there is another in back, at the top, as well a pair of backpack-style straps, so finding a convenient means of carrying your guitar shouldn't be any kind of an issue. The two zippered accessory pouches (for picks, a spare set of strings, and perhaps some music) are also a nice touch. In my opinion, this bag could easily sell for twice the price and still be considered a bargain. As it is, it's very cheap insurance for my Epi Les Paul II."
B000BUGNNM This quality bag would probably cost more like $35+ at your local music store. Appears well made, has good padding and several pockets for strings, picks, cable, whatever. Taking one star off for the slightly bothersome smell (also mentioned by other reviewers). Not terrible, but somehow chemical. Hope it goes away soon."
B000BW2D84 I bought a Pedaltrain pedal board and I have 6 individual stomp boxes that are crammed onto it. I originally bought Hosa connectors and they are high quality and have a low profile, but the selection of lengths is limited. I bought this kit with a little trepidation and proceeded to re-do the board. I swear I was done in 20 minutes!! The board looks awesome with all the cables cut to perfect length. These cables are dead silent and the connectors are high quality. The supplied cutting tool works as described and the only thing you need is a small-tip, flathead screwdriver with a medium size handle so you can firmly drive the locking screw into the cable for the final step. I could have saved some money if I had just bought these first instead of a bunch of random length patch cables."
B000BW2D84 The good thing about the Cable Station is you can make your own cables at custom lengths so you can have a neater pedal board without the need to solder the connections in place. All you have to do is cut the cable flush, insert it into the \" plug with a twisting motion, and then turn the setscrew on the side of the plug until it is tight.As a benefit, if there is a shorting of the signal all you need to do is find the offending cable, remove the plug, cut the cable, and insert the end back into the plug.Great right?Well, not really.As far as reliability goes, nothing can really replace the connection that is properly soldered. With the money you spend, you could easily get a decent soldering iron, some old cable, and some cheap plugs from Radio Shack and practice. In the end, you can by bulk cable and connectors and make them as needed.I have used this product and had to re-cut several cables at different times but only to cables that have been constantly moved around. The other ones that are more permanent haves not given me trouble, but I have experienced problems in the past. Always have a few spares that have been tested.Another annoying thing is that they give you more cable than connectors, I would think 15 connectors would be more sufficient.Is it easier than soldering? Yes.Are they reliable? For the most part, yes.Will I continue using the product? Yes, because I usually have spares.Why do I use them then? I'm lazy.This is from the Cleartone cables website about gold connectors:Don.t waste your money if you are being asked to pay extra for gold plated connectors. The thin soft gold (5-10 microns) .flash. plating looks cool, but scrapes off easily and the brass aterial underneath stops you from seeing that the gold has worn off! The brass eventually  tarnishes and causes crackling when the plug moves or twists in the socket contacts.It is true that gold is a very good conductor of electricity when mated with a gold plated socket. But the sockets inside your guitar amplifier and guitar are not usually gold, so there can be virtually no benefit to gold plated plugs."
B000BW2D84 I am a tech as well as a guitar player. I also have spent time in the past Teaching soldering. But these cables seem to be well made with good solderless connections. Most of us know by now that there's a lot of hype but it really comes down to Good Quality Cable (This Seems to be) Good Stable Connectors (These seem to be) & the connections between the two that last (Time will tell). All I know is I have Hand Soldered Special plugs with Good Cable to only have them break with use and I expect the same with these especially in a high use situation where they are plugged & unplugged often.- I do know these are signal clean & do Not bleed f highs & that is critical in my book.- They are Very Easy to use & can be done on Stage between or before sets very quickly and with NO Soldering & I Love that!I will definitely use these again unless I find a longevity problem.LM"
B000BW2D84 Very good quality cable and plugs. Easy to make custom length cables from 3 inches to 30 ft. My pedal board looks so professional and uncluttered that I actually made room for 1 more because there was no extra wire to get in the way."
B000BW2D84 This is one of my favorite music purchases in a while. Cleans up your gear's appearance tremendously. Very easy to use and lots of extra cable length."
B000BW2D84 What can I say? I started out with a couple of pedals, then a wah, then more, then a board for them, and sooner or later all those 6&#34; cords are either in the way, too short or whatever. I do like the male-male offset connectors to bring pedals together but sometimes on a board you've got odd distances. This kit does the trick, and truly was easy to use. Only once did I create a plug with a bad connection and had to redo it."
B000BWEM42 Some of the complaints are well warranted about this cheap unit.  First of all I had to fumble around with it for almost 15 minutes to get it to open straight because it seems like I got a previously-returned unit that some other customer must have bent the arms the wrong way along the joints and I was careful not to manhandle it because I could tell it would break if bent it the wrong way with too much force.  I was about to give up but I felt bad to do the return because I didnt want to make Amazon lose money and this is a weird shaped box and probably costs over $8 in postage to send back to them.But eventually I figured it out.  I am a 5 ft 10 inches tall man and this stand is tall enough because I opened it all the way and there was still an inch or 2 to spare if I wanted to raise it to the maximum.  Looks like those complaining about the height did not realize that all 3 segments can be stretched out to reveal the full height (They probably only raised 2 out of the 3 segments).So for the price I think you get what you pay for and since I just want a stand that will stay in my bedroom at home I think this unit will suffice but if you plan to travel around with it or if you are getting it for a kid under 18 years old I recommend you buy a sturdier unit than this because they will probably break it in short order.  And then you will be out the fifteen bucks plus have to buy a new one.The truth is that its a flimsy piece of junk, okay for a responsible adult that will treat it with great care (such as myself) but not for children or drunks, it is very fragile and easy to break.  I took the advice and tightened the adjustment knobs for height only finger tight without great force as previous reviewers attest that it is easy to strip out the bolt if you over-tighten so be very, very careful.I will keep mine but if I had to purchase a second unit I would not buy this one because I dont like flimsy junk and I feel even my large dog could knock this down and break the dang thing."
B000BWEM42 I bought this to replace a folding stand that was just not strong enough to hold up under the weight of some of my guitar books. This stand works great for me, and hold even the largest of my music and tab books.The construction is much better than other portable stands I've used in the past, and has two great features that I really appreciate. One is it's height adjustable, and two is the tilting head. The tilting head is a real bonous on a portable stnad, and this one works great.For the price this stand is a great buy that I would recommend to anyone, but being primarily a guitarist this stand is execptional. With the page holders tilting head and height adjustability this is one of the best stand purchases a guitarist can make."
B000BWEM42 Of course, this stand is not nearly as solid feeling as my much-heavier, solid-metal music stand I use at home. It does twist around a bit when you handle it. On the other hand, it's much lighter, collapsible, and it goes inside my practice bag instead of being a piece of furniture that takes another hand to lug. For my practices and rehearsals I want to travel light. This stand fits that bill, and its desk angle is adjustable so it works well for large fake books and for a single lead sheet. I had two pieces of thin plexiglass cut at my local hardware store to sandwich separate sheets of music so I have no problems with wind or with three-sheet-wide scores. I've never had a sturdiness problem with this stand, and I've never had it tip over, but I am careful not to tighten the knobs more than necessary, and I set the legs to their sturdiest position. I always play sitting, so height is not a consideration for me. But I have measured it and found that at its highest elevation the bottom of the sheet music is 50\" off the floor. That's plenty high for me even if I were a vocalist, and I'm 6'1\". Sure, it does not impress as would an $80-$100, stand but the quality is almost unbelievable for $13. I notice that some of the negative reviews are two or three years old, and I wonder if this stand was the same design then that it is now. It IS a lightweight stand and I take care with the knobs, but I certainly would not call it flimsy.One discrepancy that might be important to you: The stand they delivered to me this month (October 2011) was NOT a \"two section\" stand, as advertised. It's all in one section and it collapses down to a 20\" length that fits in my practice bag. I actually consider this a plus since it makes it quicker and easier to erect at rehearsals. I bought one of these Hisonic Signature stands a few years back, but they've changed it a bit. That one definitely was in two sections, and I made the top section into an excellent table-top book stand. That older one also had folding-clip-type clamps for each section instead of the turn-knob-screw-in type of clamps."
B000BWEM42 It may be a challenge to assemble it.I personally found it a challenge to assemble it but that is just how I am wired.I am not 'good' at putting things together without help.Good product after you get it assembled.James :)"
B000BWEM42 As a newbie violin student I needed a music stand.  Having purchased many things before through Amazon.com, I have learned to trust the customer reviews which get posted (remembering that there will always be a few cranks).  This music stand got good reviews and I can say that I too am very happy with it.  I would recommend this purchase to any one."
B000BWEM42 This stand is a little difficult to open.  The top the gets very stuck and turned the wrong way.  Other than that the stand collapses very small into the black bag that came with it."
B000BYPJ1U Its easy to set up and use. Simple instructions are on a sticker on the bottom of it. I re soak it easy 2-3 weeks or so. Can't tell if it's truly working on my maple wood ukulele."
B000BYPJ1U I have been using Hercos for for many years. They are simple to use and offer my banjos good humidification.  I place a Herco in the neck section of the case and another in the section where the head sits.For guitars I place a Herco near the peg head and a stringed instrument humidifier that slips between the strings in the other. Great insurance against damage to instruments owing to dryness."
B000BYPJ1U I like these humidifiers.  Works if you keep it with instrument in your case, and upkeep is minimal.  Work on all strings very well, but be careful, easy to fall out of case, so just be careful!"
B000BYPJ1U Stuck one in my guitar case to keep it just the right humidity. A must have for us dry Californians."
B000BYPJ1U It doesn't seem to work. I think maybe mine was damaged or something because it doesn't seem to absorb any water."
B000BYPJ1U I was taking lessons from a very qualified instructor and he mentioned that I need a humidifier for my guitar. At first I was not sure what I was looking for. I found the product without too much difficulty. I had learned from my instructor that these are small, placed on the hole of the guitar, and was definitely needed to keep the guitar in good playing condition. I started looking through the computer pages and settled on the Herco Guitar Humidifier because of the recommendations of thew product. Now I feel I made a wise choice and will be able to keep my quitar playing good vibrations, and good music!"
B000BYPJ1U Herco is a Jim Dunlop company and this little humidifier was suggested to me through someone who has used them for awhile. Dunlop is a trusted brand in guitar maintenance for the most part. I wanted to stay away from the typical humidifiers due to their tendencies to leak and stain the guitar wood. I have used this for a few weeks now and it still remians moist. The product came fast and the instructions are straight forward. I may order another if this one performs well."
B000BYPJ1U I used to use the Martin tube thing that you stick between the strings.  But it was a bit of a pain.  You had to soak it, then drain it, then wipe it.  Even then, I worried about it dripping on the inside of the guitar.  This is much easier and the guitar sounds great.  Highly recommended."
B000CBE3G4 Great slap echo sound.  Do not buy this with the expectation that it will act like a digital delay- it's closer to a reverb.  It provides an echo sound similar to if you were playing in a room covered in tile (an old engineering trick!).  Great for old school rock and roll, rockabilly, chicken pickin etc.  This will fatten up the sound of a dry amp.  As with all FAB pedals, I find the knob placement slightly annoying, but at this price point you can't really make a justifiable complaint.  Construction quality is somewhat cheap but the knobs feel solid and it has not failed me in more than a year."
B000CBE3G4 This pedal works but doesn't have the depth of echo I expected. I doesn't even come close to the same sound quality of my old Dan Echo DE-1 pedal.  That certainly explains the difference in price. You get what you pay for. I'm using it with a Fender Eighty-Five solid state amp. I tried it with other amps and it sounds the same. If you're looking for a good slap echo effect, I would recommend spending more money and buy the Dan Echo DE-1 pedal or even the Danelectro BLT slap echo pedal is less expensive than the Dan Echo, but still sounds better than the FAB echo pedal. The FAB echo pedal works and you can hear a definite difference with and without it. It's just not as good as I expected. I'm sorry I bought it and I don't recommend this pedal. There are much better ones on the market. Shop around."
B000CBE3G4 These FAB pedals are cheap and mostly mediocre, but I bought this on a whim to use with a Fender tube amp and it works well. As other reviewers have stated, the pedal does not have very good build quality but it seems to hold up okay as long as it's not abused. I use the echo with both a telecaster and a cigar box guitar for vintage effects.I have found that the delay works well around 50 percent and the mix can be modulated to make a good mix of reverb and delay. I don't know if I would gig with this pedal or any othe FAB pedal because of my tendency to step hard on a pedal in live environments, but it serves it's purpose well and is cheaper than alot of other delay and echo pedals if you just need a basic effect. I have seen info about modding the pedal to control the delay and may do this in the future.I have alot of other pedals and I tried this pedal with a jazz bass, with some EQ tinkering, I found a good mix of echo. I originally saw a youtube video of a bass player using a D-4 and thought it would be a good idea. Again, Danelectro makes a higher end echo pedal which probably does a better job with delay, but this is a good deal and was $100 dollars cheaper than my Electro Harmonix Memory Boy pedal and sounds cool as a vintage vibe with an old amp."
B000CBE3G4 I've needed one of these for my fender amp, yes I used to spend time dialing in the delay pedal for the rockabilly/blues numbers and if my settings got messed up, well, that would slow the show down. I wish my fender amp had this built into the amp but it didn't. This pedal makes playing rockabilly on my fender simple fast and easy. Really quick to setup and use. It's not a delay unit, it's not versatile either, but what it does, it does perfect!"
B000CBE3G4 The Danelectro FAB  series of pedals offer a great sound without digging into your budget.  The D-4 Slap Echo effects pedal works great and gives me that Old Tube Amp Reverb sound that you would only expect from a more expensive unit.  There's no fancy bells and whistles but just good old manual adjustments that lets you dial in the sound you want with no effort at all..  This series of pedals ( FAB ) have hard plastic cases and less expensive hardware than the more costly units but works quit well.  Danelectro offers more expensive units but I don't think the sound is much better, just the hardware is better, but that's my view!!!.  You can't go wrong with this product, Danelectro has been around for years and makes a great product...I have six Danelectro effects pedals and they all work great..."
B000CBE3G4 this is perfect for playing rockabilly or country music.the case is made of plastic but seems sturdy as long as you dont stomp on it too hard. but for 20 dollars its well worth the price.  this is a great product and i highly recomend it."
B000CBE3G4 I'm sure this isn't the best echo pedal (or even in the top 100), but it serves it's purpose fairly well. Stacking with other cheap danelectro pedals will degrade your tone but it isn't something that most of us can't live with. for 14.99 us it's worth taking the risk IMHOUpdate: The pedal gave up the ghost (died) In a relatively short amount of time. I replaced it with  mini modtone type delay.... I actually like the dano sound better, but the modtone will do for a slapback and it is built way better."
B000CBE3G4 I admit, i was really just curious how good a $15 pedal could possibly be, so i figured i would try one out. I had played some Danelectro stuff in the past (a baritone guitar and an amp many years ago) and remembered being satisfied with their stuff. Anyway, i figured since the pedal was so cheap, why not try it out.You know, it is a pretty decent stompbox. The slap echo is a good enhancement effect, meaning, it isnt really over the top....just gives you a mellow, reverb-ish echo...not quite delay, not quite reverb...kind of somewhere in between. I have since added it to my stompbox set up for that little something different. Not bad at all. I cant speak to battery life though, since i use an adapter combo to power all my effects. For kicks, try it out with some distortion and/or overdrive, and a wah....Anyway....Enjoy!"
B000CBE3G4 Is the the best pedal ever? Not even close. Does it do EXACTLY what you want a simple slap-back echo/reverb to do? Absolutely! I almost always have it on just to add a little depth to my synth or guitar sound. It can give you a decently wet surf-ish sound or a fast delay, rockabilly sound. It's not super versatile but if you're looking for a little depth and color for under $20 then this is what you need.I mean, COME ON! It works, it's cheap, and it doesn't take up much room on your pedal board!"
B000CBE3G4 It has a 1950's slap back echo Its good for the price No putting It down for Sounding bad as with most Danelecto products and probably higher price and lower price products used the same circuits. If You want something that Is just reverb without all the slap back then Behringer DR600 which I use for Vocal for Guitar I use RV600 which has space verb and ducking also called shimmer."
B000CBE3G4 I bought one of these pedals 3 years ago, along with some of the other Danelectro pedals in this line, and was happy with it. The sound I get with it is very, very cool. After a while it just stopped working. While I was disappointed at that moment I just ordered another one the next time I was online. You can't beat the price. If it does stop working after after a few years of use, you aren't looking at paying $90 or more for a new pedal. All of my other Danelectro pedals are still working just fine so it may have been a fluke in the electronics or I just used it to death. An electrical engineer friend and I took the pedal apart to try and fix it but decided it wasn't worth taking up our time since I could replace for $15. So I ordered another one. Definately get an adapter for this. Yes, it's casing is plastic but quite sturdy. Just don't jump on it like you're trying to put out a fire when turning it on and off. Guitars and effects are the tools of a musican's trade not the hammer and nails of a builder's. Think about getting a 1 Spot adapter so you can chain several pedals to one outlet. If you would rather use batteries for each of your pedals...well...I'd suggest buying them by the gross. Any effects pedal made by any company is going to eat batteries like a stoner eats potato chips. Used alone or with other effects, the Danelectro Fab Slap Echo Effects Pedal will be sure to delight your auditory kinesthesis."
B000CBE3G4 good price for effect  if your looking for a bit of echo then this is for you.  I have amps that have this feature that due a better job."
B000CBE3GE It's a flange pedal, what else? For the price I was really happy with it. If I knew someone who was more skilled than me I'd get the workings inside a different case. The shape is cool, but I'd feel safer with it in a metal casing. The button is smaller than I thought, but it's not an issue at all; it's kinda easier to press!As for someone like me who is starting to get into pedals, for the price just to see how they work and if you want to invest in this realm, I would recommend this!"
B000CBE3GE The regen control goes to very strong deep levels that will rumble the floor at the lower end (My fender excelsior with it's 15 inch speaker rattled the walls) of its sweep and can give a very cool effect. I notice very little tone suck with the pedal bypassed. Also, the speed know has a great range with 5+ second sweeps to super fast leslie and univibe like tones. The depth knob does it's job. It doesn't have a manual knob to move the sweep, but I leave the depth all the way up most of the time so it's no big deal. For the price, this was perfect for trying out a discreet flanger pedal instead of the one built into my Vox modeling amp."
B000CBE3GE -1 star for plastic...otherwise excellent , YouTube has many reviews on these,The FAB pedals are great values,For what a flanger is for me, this is perfect, great sounds great price."
B000CBE3GE The Danelectro FAB  series of pedals offer a great sound without digging into your budget.  The D-6 Fab Flange effects pedal works great and gives me that wobble phase shift you would only expect from a more expensive unit...  This series of pedals ( FAB ) have hard plastic cases and less expensive hardware than the more costly units but works quit well.  Danelectro offers more expensive units but I don't think the sound is much better, just the hardware is better, but that's my view!!!.  You can't go wrong with this product, Danelectro has been around for years and makes a great product...I have six Danelectro effects pedals and they all work great..."
B000CBE3GE the case is made of plastic so care should be taken in stomping on it but the product is so much fun!!! this thing is so worth the 20 dollars that i paid for it and more! wide sweeping flange effect, great harmonics and little power useage.  well worth the investment!!!!"
B000CBXZXG I'm a fanatic about my frets looking shiny and polished.  I want them to be slick when I bend notes.  If you polish too hard or too often with steel wool, it can wear down your frets.  These micro abrasive sheets do a great job without harming your frets.  I watched a Youtube demo and that sold me on ordering them.  I think Amazon had the best price."
B000CBXZXG My frets were completely whited after using one of these sheets. I recommend using it togheter with a metal cleaner and you will return your frets to original factory bright. Incredible!"
B000CBXZXG I opened the package for the first time and didn't think much of it, but the cloth works great on cleaning frets and even the cardboard template does its job.  Obviously, cardboard isn't going to last so purchase metal templates and use the cloths."
B000CBXZXG The sheets seem to work fine to polish the frets but the template is cut from the cardboard box which obviously isn't going to last long.  Also, trying to hold the cardboard on the neck is a pain and my finger is killing.I'm going to go buy a fret eraser and be done with it."
B000CBXZXG Will this replace a pro fret job? Nah...That said this works great for use a few times a year to clean the frets an make them shiny and smooth.End results[...]"
B000CCIVCA I use this all the time for testing audio cables and it works great! It's got an all metal housing and seems sturdy too. Battery lasts for months. Well done Behringer!"
B000CCIVCA Solidly built, small tester that can easily be carried around in a gig bag.  There isn't really much in the way of instructions, but the LEDs are fairly well labeled and straight forward enough to figure it out."
B000CCIVCA If you are in a band or a sound guy for a band you gotta have one of these. The time and stress saved by not depending on trial and error to eliminate good/bad cable is priceless. Bottom line!!! eliminate a variable and audio problems are faster and easier to solve."
B000CCIVCA A must have in every gig bag for checking all your cables.  I keep this with my battery tester for my active's.  Sure eliminates a lot of guess work at this first hint of audio trouble.  Easy to use and economical product."
B000CCIVCA If you'd ever been setting up on stage and discover hum or hiss this box is for you. It will find a bad or intermittent calbe in a heart beat. It will locate a shorted XLR or an open ground fast. Don't go onto the stage without one on these boxes."
B000CCIVCA We bought this tester for our son to use for his band's equipment set-up. It appears to be well constructed, and should help to diagnose problems with cables as they work through equipment connection issues."
B000CCIVCA I have been using this tester for about a year to test out my XLR cables and those that I come into contact with at work. It works but does not detect all faults (only non intermittent ones), it comes in a durable enough housing and is compact enough to take everywhere."
B000CCIVCA Does a great job of checking cords. Was able to eliminate a lot of bad cords from my stash. Tests multiple types of cords also!"
B000CCIVCA I picked up this Behringer CT100 cable tester because it takes the guesswork out of maintaining a cable collection. The unit does its job very well and it helped me find several bad cables that I previously thought were ok. It is well built and sturdy. The bottom of the tester has sharp metal corners and screws that could damage a wooden table. I suggest you get some adhesive rubber pads to support the underside.Although the machine itself is good, the accompanying documentation is awful. It presupposes a working knowledge with audio equipment that many users may lack. For example, it does not include illustrations of how the LCD readout should look when a cable is good or bad. I had to go to an audio engineering forum to find a diagram. As it turns out, the Behringer CT100 is an inexpensive knockoff of the Morley Swizz Army cable tester. The manual for the Morley unit is available online and it has diagrams that make the testing easier to understand."
B000CCIVCA This thing will test most all the cables a musician will use ... rugged, reliable and simple to understand ... for the price, it is hard to beat ..."
B000CCIVCA Idiot-proof, compact, extremely sturdy. All metal enclosure with good quality jacks, simple to understand LED readouts. Runs on 2 AA batteries.Features that set this apart from the slightly cheaperPyle-Pro PCT10are:-'Test tone' function which sends a known volume signal down the line. Very helpful in level adjustments down long chains of equipment.-'Intermittent' issue indication - This is what made me choose this model. If there's even the shortest dropout, the LEDs indicate it. Intermittent issues are the most annoying and can be difficult to troubleshoot.My only complaints:-The a small screw holding the battery cover on stripped immediately when initially inserting batteries. It was like carving a bar of soap with a knife. Quite frustrating. Used my Dremel to change it from phillips into a slotted screw, and managed to get it out.-There's an included belt clip that attaches with two screws on the back. This clip blocks access to the battery compartment, which is ridiculous. Luckily I have no need for the clip. I used one of the screws intended for the clip as a replacement to the stripped battery cover screw.-No rubber feet on the bottom + metal enclosure + battery cover screw = sliding around and marring whatever it sits on. I stuck some re-purposed rubber feet on the bottom.After the few 'problem solving' situations mentioned above, this thing is a 5 star product. Too bad they couldn't go the extra step to make it 5 star out of the box."
B000CCJP4I For the price, it's worth it I guess. If you just want to try it, go for it, that's what I got it for. It sounds nice and adds a cool tone to my setup, but after playing on a few more expensive chorus pedals I would suggest saving up if you really need a chorus pedal. But for the price it's not too bad.Oh, and the casing isn't like a wimpy plastic knife plastic. it's pretty durable. Albeit don't throw this on concrete and expect great results but it could stand a few stomps."
B000CCJP4I I mean you paid 15$ for a pedal that if you want to buy from the BOSS it's about 6times this price and if you want it behringer it's about twice this price. It does what is supposed to and it doesn't have a cheap look. For home and garage entertainment is good enough. I was trying this pedal before i buy any other pedal from the same brand, but now that i know that i like it i'm going to buy the distortion (red) one. i'm only sad they don't make a noise gate or something similar. That would be the top of the deal."
B000CCJP4I The Chorus is subtle... but it seems lacking to me. It is subtle but really weak compared to the classic rich ibanez chorus i have."
B000CCJP4I the effect it self is fine, but it is too noisy even though u don't dime it, for the price, and for this product, it is u get what u pay for."
B000CCJP4I This puppy sounds fantastic. The controls allow the effect to be adjusted from very faint to over the top Chorus with deep and intense sound. The controls are on the front, as are the in/out plugs, so it is a little tight when adjusting the knobs. Very reasonable pricing. Uses a 9V battery or 9V adaptor. It has a retro look and an old school sound, perfect."
B000CCJP4I fast delivery, works perfectly...I have 3 of the Danelectro effects pedals... hard to say which I prefer most cause they all have an individual and distinct sound...I'm partial to the chorus ...good item"
B000CCJP4I It's plastic that's 1 star deduction, but in this case, very pleas
B000CCJP4I How many times did I tweak a chorus pedal for hours and in the end decided I didn't need chorus at all. This pedal is not like that, not much to tweak but the chorus is great. Sweetens my cleans, makes the blues sound groovy and fattens the power chords. I even like it with the bass. Just a great chorus with not much to tweak."
B000CCJP4I The Danelectro FAB  series of pedals offer a great sound without digging into your budget.  The D-5 Chorus effects pedal works great and gives me that soft phase shift you would only expect from a more expensive unit...  This series of pedals ( FAB ) have hard plastic cases and less expensive hardware than the more costly units but works quit well.  Danelectro offers more expensive units but I don't think the sound is much better, just the hardware is better, but that's my view!!!.  You can't go wrong with this product, Danelectro has been around for years and makes a great product...I have six Danelectro effects pedals and they all work great..."
B000CCJP4I Yes, this pedal is made of plastic. Yes it is inexpensive. But don't be fooled- unless you really mash on the switch button like an idiot, or over torque the battery cover screw too hard with a screw driver and strip out the plastic threads- it is pretty tough and durable. The chorus effect has plenty of adjustment, tone, and depth. It may not be a Boss pedal, but for $15.99 you are getting a tremendous value and it sounds very good. I was so impressed with these inexpensive pedals I now own 4 or 5 of them. As a hobbyist guitar player who does not want to invest hundreds of dollars into multiple effects pedals- I am into 4 or 5 of them PLUS associated cables and a power adapter for about the same amount than I could buy ONE Boss or other high quality pedal for.I would also recommend buying the Danelectrode 9V power adapter if you use multiple pedals. You can also buy a 5 gang power cable and daisy chain up to 4 or 5 pedals from the same power supply to make your own pedal board. If you have multiple Danelectro pedals it is a clean way to tie them together. I also bought some short 6 inch instrument cables and daisy chained the pedal inputs/outputs together so I can have mixed effects, or have each one independently.These pedals have been used almost daily for a couple of months now and I have not had one issue with any to date. A few other guitar player friends that have tried mine out are also very impressed by them. Absolutely a 5 star value!"
B000CCJP4I Got this little guy last night to use with my Squier Tele Custom II, hooked it up and played around with it for a while and it really impressed me for the quality of effect you get for nearly pocket change! I also have a Digitech RP-50 that has multiple effects including different types of chorus and this Fab Chorus sounds better than any of the RP-50's chorus settings.  I am so looking forward to laying down some cool tracks using this with the Tele, my Applause acoustic/electric, and my Squier Vintage Modified 70's bass guitar. And like other folks who've bought this product, I'll most likely be getting some of Danelectro's other Fab boxes and the Dan Electrode power supply."
B000CCJP4I The Danelectro FAB series is supposed to be everything we hate about effects pedals.  Cheap.  Mass-produced.  Housed in a plastic casing.  But the FAB series offers affordable effects ($15 to $20) at surprisingly good quality, and end up sounding as good as some pedals that cost 3 times more.  If this pedal cost $50, I might gripe about how tight together the input/output/9V jacks are.  I might also complain about the weird position of the Mix, Speed, and Depth controls on the top of the unit, or the small footswitch.  But at this price, for it to sound THIS good, I can't complain at all.Don't expect the FAB series to be good at everything.  But if there's and effect out there that you only use once in awhile (especially anything involving modulation or delay), the FAB series is going to do it well, and do it for a fraction of the cost of other pedals.  It's just a great option to have for casual/budget guitarists."
B000CCJP4I Gives a nice warped slightly detuned effect to your first at the right settings.(Think Alice in chains, or REALLY distorted live nirvana solo) admittedly not everyone's into the whole grunge tone. But it was what I was looking for.Has some nice shimmers and thickening on other settings too.And hey, you can pretty much get it for pocket change."
B000CCJP4I I have yet to find a pedal that can match this little guys desired effect......  If you know how to use it, it really delivers a good effect."
B000CCJP4I its sound pretty good .. i mean , the range /rate arent as broad as others i've tried ..but i stomp on it regularly.. it cuts my signal a bit .. so i compensate ,,an always leave a bit of extra volume in the bank to make it up..all in all=worth it."
B000CCMWVG I shopped around local music shops and was discouraged with the prices. Checked out Amazon and was a little skeptical with the reasonable price, but pleasantly surprised when we received it."
B000CCMWVG I got the $50 standard black on black case.  The case arrived within 2 days via UPS during the middle of the Christmas rush! Wow! Very fast shipping and it was adequately packaged and there was no sign of the box being abused in anyway. Regarding the item itself, I am bit lukewarm. I have a $500 Washburn and wanted something more than a gig bag for going to and from gigs and practice sessions. And I got that. Its lightweight, plenty of room in the gear box and on top of the guitar head.  However, the fit is a bit loose and I don't have the sense that this case will stand up to much abuse over time.  So if you have a pricey guitar or are planning to load you guitar in a truck with other gear, or might ship your guitar or take it on a plane, this case is not the one you want to buy."
B000CCMWVG My Seagull Entourage Rustic fits very snug (I think that is a good thing, not certain) in the case which has a nice faux fur lining and seems well made.I was considering theSeagull Dreadnought Casebut there were no useful pictures or details on the item. I decided to try the Guardian and save a few bucks.Seems like I made a good choice."
B000CCMWVG Guardian?  Well, it is padded, but I've only gigged once since having the item (with 3 rehearsals held prior) and I can say that the case is nicked up \"pretty good,\" as they say in the South.  Yes, it will last, because it is a guitar case, but there's no way there's enough security to protect an instrument on a plane.  Now, that's for flight cases to handle, but don't even come near abusing your instrument while it is housed inside this case, because you may be disappointed to have to buy new parts once the \"guardian\" fails to guard against crushing your hardware.  This item is not one of the better cases out there, but it does suffice, and it does look good.  The first day I got it, someone said, \"nice case, it looks great!\"  Say that now, though, after using it outside the house 4 times, and you'd be a lying SOB."
B000CCMWVG This is a typical inexpensive hardshell guitar case made in China.  I bought it to replace the original (chipboard) case for a 1963 Gibson ES-135 archtop.  Lower bout is 16&#34; wide, upper bout is 12&#34; wide, body is 21 &#34; long, and it's about 5&#34; deep at the bridge.  Fits very snugly in this case which is what I was hoping for.  The case is about 4&#34; longer than the top of the headstock but I didn't expect an exact fit.  The wood shell is thin so don't drop anything on it but it is also lighter than a lot of other cases.  Normal plush fake fur inside with about 3/4 of soft foam all around.  Black tolex on the outside is thin but looks okay.  This is NOT a case to take on the road or if you travel by air but it is adequate for casual use.  Only annoying thing: the case arrived locked.  The keys were, of course, inside the case.  Dumb.  A friend at a music store used a key from another Guardian case to unlock it.  A good reminder that the case latch lock is to keep the latch from popping open and NOT to keep crooks out."
B000CCMWVG Great quality, nice interior, and fits my Yamaha F335 perfectly. Solid and steardy case that will last a very long time."
B000CCMWVG my fav cases ever"
B000CD1R7K Good quality, strong and excellent finish. Nicely priced. A foot rest will help you maintain a good posture while playing, a must for classical players."
B000CD1R7K It does exactly what it says it does.  My only complaint is I wish it could go a notch or two lower.  But very pleased.  It's cheap and works like a champ"
B000CD1R7K It's a great versatile foot rest that any guitar player can benefit from, very good value at only $10 not counting shipping, very satisfied."
B000CD1R7K I've been on a guitar accessory shopping spree lately, and this is my favorite purchase as of late.  I've bought nice straps, but when I'm practicing for hours at a time, this foot rest is a great reprieve, and literally a weight off my shoulders."
B000CD1R7K Was using a box and this is a great help.  My stomach doesn't feel wrenched anymore.  I use it on my right leg with the guitar on the right leg.  Maybe not as conventional as the classic position but it works for me."
B000CD1R7K Great foot rest, it's not flimsy.  But it's not light weight.  I put it in my guitar bag to carry with me and I definitely feel that it's there.  I like that it's adjustable to various heights.  I am short (5'1\") so I usually have it on the highest setting to prop up my left leg when I'm playing classical guitar to get the guitar at the right angle.  But I sometimes adjust it down when I switch it to my right leg and when I'm playing Flamenco and rather than rest the guitar between my legs like in the classical posture, I shift it over to my right leg.  I ended up getting a 2nd one so that I keep the one at the highest setting for when I'm playing classical, and then the other one at the lower setting for my Flamenco playing.  Great foot rest, I recommend it."
B000CD1R7K Just what I needed to position my guitar while seated.  I was worried it would not hold the weight, but it does well."
B000CD1R7K I was looking for a foot rest for a good value and that is exactly what I got.  There isn't too much to say about it.  It's sturdy.  It's adjustable.  It's a great price.  It really made playing easier for me."
B000CD1R7K This little foot stool is really sturdy. It stays in place beautifully. No rocking sideways, no wobbly action.If one of the notches doesn't do it for you, you're screwed: There's no gradual adjustment. But the positions it allows make sense for 99% of players."
B000CD1R7K "
B000CD1R7K This is heavy, but strong.  Very comfortable, I cannot carry it around with me, but it works well at home.  I recommend it."
B000CD1R7K I like this product, but wish it had a wider foot or base to it for carpeted areas, it does get a little unstable on carpet.  Does fine on hard floors."
B000CD1R7K The other reviews for this foot rest called it sturdy and well built. They were right. It can be adjusted to a number of different heights to suit your particular needs - and based on the design of the stand it will stay where it's put. One of the best parts is that while it is stable enough to be the main foot rest where I play my guitar it can be collapsed flat and it easily fits into a bag or backpack - probably around half of the thickness of a chord book, although heavier, as it is steel with a rubber tread on top. It feels like I will own this for a long time - a well priced, good value.Edit2/2013After owning this for around a year and using it every day I find that it still looks and works like new. I recommend it highly."
B00627V4UU while filming this season- 911 happened. I was stunned at what happened to danny Sorenson. I wanted to see more of his character. after losing simone-this was too sudden. new characters emerged and were good too and the flow continued. still made me want to see more."
B00627V4UU I love NYPD Blue because it's so well written, has such great talent, and it is not overwhelmed with sex scenes.  Yes it contains some, but it's not all the time.  The stories are about people on the street and the everyday happenings of a cop shop.  Simply one of the best shows of its kind out there."
B0063BGBO4 Early Bret Easton Ellis novels and their subsequent film adaptations were famous for portrayals of disaffected youth doing naughty things and contemplating life. Now, imagine a handful of characters in their forties doing the same thing, and you've got I Melt With You. Rob Lowe, Jeremy Piven, Thomas Jane, and Christian McKay are old college buddies who meet up annually at Big Sur to celebrate a birthday, but with their own families and hidden secrets plaguing them, they embark on a week of drugs and parties until a tragedy forces them to face their past. Steer clear of I Melt With You, the film's laughable script and ludicrous plot points do nothing to help the actors trying so desperately to make something of the material."
B0063BGBO4 Something is seriously wrong with the first half, and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out what it is- it's incredibly boring due to being plotless.  It's about a group of middle aged party animals that reunite for a weekend (or week) of heavy fun, drugs and drinking but... for over an hour, that's *all* they do.  This might be fun for them but certainly not for us, the viewers.  They drink and do all kinds of drugs, they roll down hills, they drive fast cars, they simply party without taking a break while reminiscing about old times and past girlfriends.However the second half... wow, now *that's* what I call an improvement!  A drastically different turn of events, in fact.  When one of the friends suddenly commits suicide due to past memories coming back to haunt him, this begins a roller coaster ride of emotions and discussions on what to do with the body, and eventually each friend is affected by becoming progressively worse mentally.  They debate whether doing the right thing and calling the cops is what they should do, or.. should they bury the body in the back yard?  After all, they're heavily under the influence of drugs (of course they don't act like they are- storyline flaw there) and a cop would be able to detect this right away.  From here, well let's just say, the emotions really take their toll on each of the friends as tensions rise and accusations fly.Of course it never really made sense how a female cop just suddenly enters the picture without reason, and even worse is the final chase scene.  Without spoiling the final segment, let's just say, why wouldn't she have a gun after it becomes perfectly clear that the suspect she's after is obviously guilty?  Another illogical moment of writing.Either way, it's unforgivable to ignore the first hour of deplorable party time that does absolutely nothing but bore me to tears.  The only time I'm impressed is when classic Sex Pistols and Funkadelic songs are playing.  REALLY good songs too, so at least the soundtrack is up to par which is more than I can say for the rest of the film.  But hey, if you're an incredibly patient person, maybe you'd be able to tolerate the first hour of nonsense just to experience the significantly better second part.  Since so much time is devoted to very little substance however, I have a hard time recommending this one."
B0063BGBO4 I MELT WITH YOU is a disturbing film - in the psychological/ psychosocial sense - but perhaps the most disturbing aspect of it is the fact that the title it is based on a song lyric, suggesting that the story may indeed be more universal than we imagine. To read the lyric is imperative to understanding the film: `(Let's stop the world) I'll stop the world and melt with you/ (Let's stop the world) I've seen some changes but it's getting better all the/ Time / (Let's stop the world) There's nothing you and I won't do/ (Let's stop the world) I'll stop the world and melt with you/ The future's open wide'When four 40-something college friends - Richard (Thomas Jane), Ron (Jeremy Piven), Jonathan (Rob Lowe), and Tim (Christian McKay) - meet up for their annual reunion, things start to spiral out of control, and a suicide pact they made as young men is revisited. A loud, and rather repulsive weekend of hardcore partying with drugs, alcohol, and sex - a binge in the beautiful Big Sur area - leads them to recognize that now they're all middle aged and not really happy about the directions their lives have taken. The fact that in their younger they made a pact while under the influence of drugs that if they were unhappy as middle-aged men, they'd kill themselves a pact they signed in blood. One of the men - Tim - is gay and is the most distraught and his decision to carry out the pact drives the remainder of the story to its end.This sad but conceivable story was written by Glenn Porter who with director Mark Pellington wrote the screenplay.  The dialogue borders on inane at times but the theme of the film is riveting. It is a disturbing story that only grows in the degree of wastefulness of lives in retrospect. Grady Harp, September 12"
B0063BGBO4 Firstly, let me tell you this film is about four friends and a week they spend together. They're all 44 years of age and the characters are varied. One is a self respecting artist/writer who says the artist should not be cynical, then you have a doc who is estranged from his family and his ex wife is remarried and he is suffering from helplessness blues, then you have an interesting sad happy homosexual man and lastly a regular guy with competitive genes. Four of them are trying their best to run away from their miseries during this get away and there is always some awesome music playing in the background. The music is an easy 10. The cast is mostly people you've seen on HBO (Entourage, West Wing, Hung..) The storyline is unique and I felt a constant surge of energy. If I could change something about the film, I'd add a few more sensitive dialogs without making it seem a little pushed. The editing could have been a little more \"free\" and that would have set it free. I can picture this film not doing too well and tanking completely but it had a few unique situations and conversations but towards the end like it's characters it ends up drugged and hungover which is why I really liked it, I guess. It was honest in that sense but a little more intelligence and... Anyway, thank you film-makers for the wonderful sound track, I have discovered some 10 good songs and varied artists. It is a good portray of the human condition and a dialog by Sasha Grey is quite possibly the best scene in the film. WATCH IT!"
B0063BGBO4 Mark Pellington's I MELT WITH YOU is less a traditional narrative film and something more experimental; something more akin to a visual performance piece and not necessarily so much about the plot or dialogue. However, that's not to say that dialogue or plot don't exist. They're there and they're strong, and as far as performance is concerned, this ensemble is pretty impressive.Richard the writer (the always excellent Thomas Jane), Ron the financier (the terrific Jeremy Piven), Jonathan the doctor (The mostly under-appreciated Rob Lowe) and Timothy the question mark(the completely unknown Christian McKay) are four old college friends now all at 44 years of age who made a pact to meet up every year for a Spring Break getaway from family and work and all the pleasures/stresses those cause and have a week together in their own private Land-Of-Do-As-You-Please. Multiple glasses of alcohol are ingested. A smorgasbord of drugs are swallowed, snorted, inhaled and injected, partially as a gift from Jonathan the doctor. Richard brings some human party favors in young nubile female and male company (included is former adult star turned serious actress Sasha Grey). 80's Music is played constantly and loudly. They laugh as they reminisce and there is the sensation of freedom from the reality of their current lives, but it's exceedingly short-lived. Richard is a former writer-turned-teacher and serial womanizer; Ron is happily married with a great family but his financial shortcuts are catching up to him; Jonathan is wholly disillusioned with his profession and has reduced to selling fake painkiller prescriptions as well as being a divorcee with a young son who calls his step-father \"daddy\" now; Timothy is still grieving over the loss of his boyfriend 5 years prior.This week will be very different than the 22 that preceded it, though, and it will not end well for any of them.Things start out amicably enough, but as the week progresses, the group spirals out of control and a descent into what some might consider drug-addled madness but is actually something deeper and more meaningful for the four of them. Things become even more tense when the local town sheriff (the very talented and lovely Carla Gugino) begins to suspect there are darker things going on at the house these men have rented for the week.Mark Pellington, best-known for the dour domestic terrorism thriller ARLINGTON ROAD, goes back to his roots as a music-video director (where he is best known for the unforgettable video for Pearl Jam's haunting \"Jeremy\")as peppered generously throughout the film are brief flashes of the past, present and future, and meditative shots of the water, sand and rocks that surround their rented house in Monterey which is more evocative of Terrence Malick's work. It's an odd mix of smash-cut editing and longer and more visually arresting takes, and it's as disorienting as the constant haze of drugs and alcohol our characters are in.This film does suffer at times from what have come to be referred to around the internet as \"First World Problems\"; which is essentially a bunch of good-looking white men sit around a campfire and complain about their sex lives, their lack of wealth, and how unsatisfying their future is from how they were as kids. That was a big problem for me with Lisa Chodolenko's THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT, but these problems become alternately more and less significant as the film reaches its second act where a drastic, desperate and tragic act leads these men to re-evaluate their problems against the vow they made to one another all those years ago. The whole rest of the film hinges on the importance of this vow, but the vow remains non-specific (but implied) until the very end.Aside from Pellington's expert use of the visual style in this film, the performances from the leads are range from very solid to downright awesome. Jane is absolutely mesmerizing in this film, as is Piven. Their characters really have the heavy lifting to do from a dramatic standpoint and they carry the emotional core of the film effortlessly. Both McKay and Lowe do very solid work here, but sadly their characters feel somewhat short-changed with the prominence of Jane and Piven. Gugino unfortunately has little to do, but is utterly convincing when she's doing it. The various supporting characters, such as Tom Bower playing an ancient mariner and the aforementioned Grey playing a somewhat spiritual and redemptive madonna/whore type have even less to do, other than spout some wisdom or forgiveness.It's definitely not a film not for everyone. While having a linear narrative, it still may be somewhat troublesome for a more literal-minded viewer. Personally, while being a somewhat upsetting and nihilistic film (something Jane seems to do very well: see THE MIST), it's also a very powerful and beautiful film about bonds that stretch across the years and the promises we make to our friends. The symbolism can get a little too heavy-handed and ham-fisted occasionally, but the rest of the film makes up for that.Also, killer soundtrack."
B0063BGBO4 The acting was great but the movie felt like it was dragging on.  The drug use took away from character development and the plot was lacking.  With such a great cast, I was expecting something better.The sound track was good though."
B0063BGBO4 There are two questions one has to propose after watching an overwrought parable of a film like \"I Melt With You.\" Is the movie any good? And is it worth watching? I know some who feel these answers are always the same, but I don't. If someone asked me if Mark Pellington's outrageous examination of middle-aged regret was good, I'd have to say no. So over-the-top and patently ridiculous, the movie is an absolute mess tonally and thematically (even to the point of morphing into a thriller for its conclusion). But is it worth watching? There's something to be said about the absolute madness of it all that makes \"I Melt With You\" sickly fascinating. Even as I was laughing at how inept the story line felt, the movie kept pushing into greater and greater outrageousness. And I must admit, there is an odd entertainment factor to be gleaned from this unpredictability. While it may not be a \"good\" movie, it patently refuses to back down and play it safe. I respect that as well. My rating, therefore, is divided. I give it one star on merit and three stars for its bold commitment to lunacy. Overall, I'll make it two stars and predict that this is the love-it or hate-it proposition of the season.The movie introduces four childhood friends who get together once a year for a week of insane debauchery. Without much preamble or development, we meet the guys briefly in their everyday lives before they assemble at an isolated chalet. Thomas Jane, Jeremy Piven, Rob Lowe, and Christian McKay play the quartet and it's clear that, as a whole, they've been a pretty privileged bunch. But looks can be deceiving, or so the screenplay would have you believe. Each man is haunted by regret and the life not chosen. Despite being successful professionals (some with families), the trip instantly devolves into a drug-fueled music video of bad acts and excess. The movie, in these early scenes, has so little plot momentum that it seems a repetitive (and rather silly) glorification of poor choices and a complete disconnection with recognizable humanity. As each man faces his supposed demons and idealizes a more innocent time, the movie slows down to hear their hard luck stories. But one tragedy and a childhood promise will forever change these men. I won't reveal any more than that, other than to say that the movie just gets systematically more loony as it progresses.With pulsing music, disjointed camera work, and absolute hysterics, the movie becomes a preposterous thriller. To their credit, the actors never waver and all serve up deliciously over-the-top interpretations of \"real\" people. I know some will consider the subject matter provocative and thought-provoking, but it's so far out there--you can't take any of it seriously. But by the time the film enters its final 45 minutes (and the great Carla Gugino shows up), the movie has jumped a school of sharks (not just one) to enter bad movie nirvana. It's so bad, it's good! I'm not sure how anyone would get deep meaning out of \"I Melt With You,\" although its central premise is sound enough. If you do, however, good on you! For me, it's a master class of excess that takes itself way too seriously and thus becomes an absolute treat for lovers of bad movie mayhem. Without the slow start, maybe I'd have rated this higher for the delirium! As is, though, I hated it AND loved it (but for all the wrong reasons), yet am hard pressed to actually recommend it. Despite those that will proclaim it some sort of modern masterpiece, there's a reason its critical consensus on Metacritic is 26 out of 100. KGHarris, 8/12."
B0063BGBO4 This is actually a painful movie to watch and although the Richard character is truly disturbing ifnot despicable, the others are pretty well not worth watching at all.  There is so much drug and alcoholuse that the humanity is erased from the film.  Awful.  Do not bother unless you yourself are part ofthis drug culture that's being portrayed."
B0063BGBO4 This film is actually a lot better than I expected. Five college grads reunite at a beachhouse getaway for the weekend, when things go horribly wrong from depression and a plethora of drugs to add to the mix."
B0063BGBO4 Mark Pellington's Sundance disaster, titled 'I Melt With You', is one of the strangest, incredibly maddening and tonally challenged films that I have seen all year. There are pros and cons - more of the latter than the former - and it is easy to see why so many critics have slashed it to bits. With that being said, it is certainly not as bad as everyone thinks it is, but it could have been a whole hell of a lot better.The film focuses on the yearly reunion of four friends who went to college together in the eighties. Every one of these individuals somehow failed to live the dream, and as a result, they have taken questionable paths in life. Over the course of a drug-filled week, the men reminisce on the past, proceed to wax philosophical on the present, listen to the music of their youth, party with girls, drink obscene amounts of hard liquor, snort mountains of coke, and pop every pill known to mankind. Between this foursome, moments of sobriety are extremely rare - the main characters remain intoxicated for at least two thirds of the running time.The 'Big Chill' meets 'Scarface' vibe comes to a screeching halt when one of the men, racked with guilt over the death of his lover, commits suicide - a tragic occurrence which is partially linked to a pact the four men made twenty five years ago, which all of them, save for one, managed to forget. You read that correctly. Twenty five years prior to this particular reunion, these boys made a binding promise to one another - a contract, signed in blood. When the film reveals exactly what the promise entails, it is a shocking discovery.This begins a downward spiral that neither one of them can escape. It is here that the tone of the film changes for the worse, and as a result, becomes more than a bit preposterous. The cast includes Thomas Jane, Jeremy Piven, Rob Lowe, and Christian McKay. The performances are hit (Christian McKay) and miss (just about everyone else, especially Thomas Jane).The first half of the film is pretty decent, and I was disappointed to see it devolve so quickly. What could have been an extremely provocative study of broken dreams and arrested development becomes a hopelessly melodramatic pile of drivel.Rated R, 122 minutes, directed by Mark Pellington, released by Magnolia Pictures. Available on Blu-ray and DVD on February 28th from Magnolia Home Entertainment."
B0063ONN9C My daughter keeps asking to watch season 1 again even though we have season 2....not sure what that's about. The writing seems as vapid as usual to me. Whatever...."
B0063ONN9C I used to hate this show, but I guess it finally grew on me. My daughter is obsessed with it so I guess after a while I started to see the appeal. The songs are cute, the characters are cute too. The colors are bright and the animation is great. I like that the characters look different (they aren't all little white kids) and that there are boy mermaids! How darling! Also, Mr. Grouper is a teacher. Usually on tv teachers are portrayed as women and men are portrayed as wanting nothing (wholesome) to do with children. In the &#34;time for lunch&#34; segment at least one of the kids (usually Oona for some reason) has a healthy lunch item like a veggie burger or carrot sticks. I always think it's positive to show children enjoying healthy snacks, even if they are cartoon mermaid children.My daughter loves Nonni and Deema. Nonni is precious and his deadpan humor is in stark contrast to the antics of the other characters. Deema is a little diva (I think we all know a little girl like this) and my daughter loves her hair. She loves to draw swirls and say it's Deema's hair.Her favorite episode is the one with the witch (voiced by Wanda Sykes) who wants to turn everyone into frogs. The songs and story are very creative. I thought it was sweet how they made the Big Bad Wolf a total sweetheart and the Giant a softie.To be honest, I don't think it's very educational. I know it makes attempts at education but I really don't think it comes across. I don't mind letting my daughter have a bit of shallow entertainment in small doses, since she is advanced for her age. But for kids and parents there are more educational shows."
B0063ONN9C Our 14 month old absolutely loves it!!! Hums the theme song all day long!"
B0063ONN9C The songs are catchy and the characters and stories are super cute.  We are totally on the guppy train in this house :)"
B0063ONN9C I do really like it. It was very, very good because teach little lessons, dance and sing and just have fun.  It's a show that makes me laugh!"
B0063ONN9C My child loves this show.  It's great to watch them interact and learn.  I totally recommend it for any pre-schoolers"
B0063ONN9C My 3 1/2 year old granddaughter loves this series.  So happy to see it is available on Amazon, now she can watch whenever she likes."
B0063ONN9C Wonderful, family entertainment.  This program is both educational and delightful!  I love watching it with my son."
B0063ONN9C My toddler says bubba ga (bubble guppies) within 10 feet of seeing a tv. He loves all of the singing, Its educational so why not, 3rd season here we come"
B0063ONN9C Cute show.  My kids love it, especially my 21-month-old daughter.  She asks for it by name frequently!"
B0063ONN9C My 2 year old son loves this show! I am so glad he is able to watch it through amazon prime on my kindle! Cute, educational and fun!"
B0063ONN9C This is a fun show. My 2 year old granddaughter loves it. She has learned things from it and loves to &#34;sing&#34; and dance with the guppies."
B0063ONN9C My granddaughter loves Bubble Guppies, and watches them as often as possible!  She is 4 years old.  It's colorful, has a catchy tune, and good story lines."
B0063ONN9C My preschooler loves the Bubble Guppies!  It's colorful.  The stories are great.  But, best of all the music is top notch.  There are some children's shows that can drive you insane with the music, but Bubbly Guppies will have even adults singing along.  We're so glad this is on Amazon Prime now."
B0063ONN9C Kiddo adores this show. She love, love, loves the music and asks to watch the songs again and again. She even tries to copy the dancing! She's also learned a ton from the show. All those Mr. Grouper let's think about its she has memorized the answers and not just repeats them, but understands them. She even memorized the songs down to who dances/sings in the background on each one. It's like a kid magnet! If I play this when we're traveling random children drift over to us in the airport to look over her shoulder! Usually when we're at home I let her watch one show a day after lunch/before nap and it's usually this, Umizoomi, or a Go, Diego, Go (she's animal obsessed). Hope she continues to love it because she &#34;discovered&#34; this around the same time as Sesame Street and she's very over sesame. This keeps going strong!"
B0064JGWZS This is definitely a weak series. It's an interesting premise but I just found so much of it cliched and PC'd out it's hard to swallow. First of all the very silly idea that some ex-rebel soldier would chase various people, even be able to do that much after a chaotic war, in order to get revenge for his wifes death-GAG. The main character has such wooden acting it's hard to care much about anything he does, even cold blooded murder in revenge. Some ex-slave owner part of the despotic South is hard to have much sympathy for. Oh and he's a saint too he just pays the ladies of the evening for services not rendered because of his noble nature-GAG. This is all just blather.This IS a ripoff of Deadwood down to the 2 friends looking to make an enterprise in a dangerous place, the Irish film projectionists(see Deadwood if you don't know who I'm comparing them to). I could care less about them too. Ugh the PC cliches just abound here. Everyone's represented, the blacks, the Indians, the British heroin, the evil bossman and yes the wronged rebel so sad-GAG. Everyone gets their small piece of heaven in each episode here so we can all get our pre-ordained PC helping.For anyone used to watching the HBO/Showtime stuff this is just too weak and shallow. Now I'm sure all you people who bought this will disagree, of course if you bought it you disagree! Ever notice how that works? It's hard to be critical of your own choices or yourself isn't it?This review is not for those who have bought this(or are paid to give good reviews) it's for those looking for an honest opinion of this series who are thinking of watching it or buying it."
B0064JGWZS AMC is still making the best shows on TV, and this one is near the top.  It takes a while to develop the characters, but if you stick it out then the wait is well worth it."
B0064JGWZS Finally the technical problems are resolved!SPOILERS:Chaos reigns in Hell on Wheels. Just desserts are delivered to the Swede. Rewards and loses come to others. While Bohannan's guilt and rage lead him to go too far."
B0064JGWZS I have watched many westerns with my Dad and this is one of the best! It tells about the beginning of the railroad and how the people have lived besides the main story about a Civil War Veteran that is looking for revenge toward the men that killed his wife and son. I can not wait for Season 3 to start on Aug. 10th!!"
B0064JGWZS You know, I've got my Dad to thank for getting me into Westerns. Starting out with the likes of Gene Autry and Roy Rogers, going onto John Wayne and onto shows like The Lone Ranger-The Rifleman and then onto Gunsmoke-Wild Wild West and the like. I'vw watched them pretty much all my life and enjoy them very much. Heck, a time or two- I've even picked novels by Louis Lamour-Robert B. McNeill-Zane Grey and others and read them. I guess a part of me wishes I existed during them days so I could roam the plains and see the beautiful splendor of the outdoors. Anyhow, because of my love for Westerns, I happen to be talking to a friend one day about viewing Streets of Loredo recently. I told him how I enjoyed it but couldn't find any new Westerns out there that I hadn't already seen at some point(I am 45 years old, mind you). He recommended Hell On Wheels. The only thing he really told me about it was that it took place after the Civil War and that it involved the building of the transcontinental railroad. I was somewhat reluctant on getting it. Then, one day, my better half and I were renting a movie from Redbox when I'd seen the first five episodes available on DVD...so, I gave it a shot.It goes alot deeper than my friends' initial description of the show. It centers on a Confederate soldier who's out to exact revenge on the Union soldiers who murdered his wife. He ends up following their trail to the traveling town of, you guessed it, Hell On Wheels.The First Season does have its' moments but, for the most part, is a hard-hitting Western series that fans of Deadwood and the like will love.  If you'll notice, reviewers(inlcluding me) keep bringing up Deadwood. The reason is the show is well-written, the characters grow on you and it always keeps you coming back."
B0064JGWZS Interesting idea.  There are a lot of positives -- modern take on a western, shows some of the US expansion following the Civil War.  Good start."
B0064JGWZS I love to watch this show. And I'm not going to lie to you the main reason is because Anson Mount is so Hot. He really is the reason I started to watch the show."
B0064JGWZS I love the show as I said in the title and I'll say it again it is just great. I think the appeal for me is I like the character of Mr. Bohannan (Anson Mount) he really is the whole show and his character development has been great. I might even have a slight man crush on him I can't quite tell. I mean the show was not without its flaws but I don't agree with some of the directions some of the characters have taken (head shot) but still a great show and I'm excited for season 2.So to somebody who likes westerns likes cowboys and Indians and things like that this is a great series with high production value, great acting and amazing sets. They really set the stage for the time and you never feel a break from that period of time.Oh and one last thing I just love Mr. Bohannan's voice as you can tell from the title hopefully you read \"Yeah that seems about right\" in his voice because one of his lines from one of the shows and that's how I say it and I LOL every time.Enjoy the show as I know you will."
B0064JGWZS When I first heard about \"Hell on Wheels,\" I really thought it might be yet another unforgettable series. Instead, this is entertainment PLUS, all the way through Season One, that will have you waiting for the next Season, too (or is that, Two?)!Anson Mount is simply terrific as Cullen Bohannan and Colm Meaney is always a pleasure to watch! Great to see Monk's Ted Levine in a totally different role (though he doesn't make it through all of Season One!) and finally, a word of warning: the violence can get REALLY violent!I loved \"Deadwood\", but Hell on Wheels has made me forget all about it!"
B0064JGWZS I am a fan of historical fiction when it is done WITHOUT a political agenda. Good historical fiction sticks as close to the truth as possible to educate as well as entertain. Sometimes the writer needs to improvise to keep the storyline flowing--but it also should be as close to the truth as possible.The writers REPLACED the Irish immigrants who were the majority immigrant population who built the eastern portion of the railroad (along with Poles, Italians, Swedes and Germans) with arrogant &#34;in-your-face&#34; Farrakhan blacks. The Chinese who built the western portion are barely mentioned. I am an advocate of giving credit where credit is due and to write a series given blacks credit for what others have done I find insulting.I will not buy the politically correct Hollywood formula &#34;White/Black/Female&#34; second season."
B0064JGWZS I have read all the reviews here at Amazon about Hell On Wheels.  Most people get all defensive and say it's just \"deadwood light\" or something along those lines.  Admittedly, I have never seen Deadwood, so I don't know if these two are similar or not.  What I can tell you is this; I've read the show summary for Deadwood and I've watched Hell On Wheels.  Just from what I've read about Deadwood, it's nothing like Hell On Wheels as far as show plot.  Deadwood is mostly about general western reenactment and everyday life in what the real wild west would've been like.  Although I am sure there are alot of similarities in how the shows look and feel, Hell On Wheels differs in alot of ways.  Hell On Wheels is a modern day western show about building a railroad in the west, which sets it apart from Deadwood.  I've not read anything remotely close to that in the reviews for Deadwood.  In fact, the only real influence from Deadwood that makes it onto Hell On Wheels is some vague character similarities.With all of that being said, I'm not even gonna mention Deadwood at length anymore.  I'm not interested in that show.  I am, however, a big fan of Hell On Wheels.  It's a unique concept that has great plots and well-defined characters that makes this show compelling television.  From Cullen Bohannon to Thomas Durante to Robert Bell and his wife[forgetting her name] to Ferguson[Common's character].  All of these individuals make for intriguing on-screen dynamics with multiple implications and story plots that make you truly appreciate the effort AMC gave this show.  It's something that definetely stands out in AMC's television show lineup and something any casual western lover would enjoy.  And unlike old school westerns, Hell On Wheels has a consistent pace with a great story that does not drag on or dance around the point.  It's simple, straightforward storytelling that speaks for itself and goes directly at the audience.  Also unlike normal western television Hell On Wheels is not too dark.  It has elements of realism in its portrayal and is dark but not so much so that it looks gloomy[as Deadwood seems just by initial appearance].  Hell On Wheels has humorous moments while also remaining true to how a real western railroad work crew camp would look & feel like.  Just watching the bonus features on how they made the look of the show proves how much effort the show creators took into recreating authenticity.  To me, Hell On Wheels is a unique show that may take elements from past shows or westerns, but also stands on its own as completely different entity to itself.  It's not \"deadwood light\" or anything else in my opinion.  It is Hell On Wheels, a great show that deserves to be on television for awhile if the show keeps a consistency to it and doesn't overdo it or overexaggerate.  I could see this show lasting for at least 5 seasons or better if done right."
B0064JGWZS Given as a gift! they loved it and are waiting for me to get the nest series in this collection!!!!"
B0064JGWZS I'm on the fence on whether or not I'll get another season. But I liked it enough to where I will keep it.  (If I don't like a DVD I purchased, I send it on to friends who might.)  I would actually rate it 3 1/2.  A little violent, but not quite as bad as other shows I've seen."
B0064JGWZS My wife and I recently had the delight of taking a guided tour through the streets of Tombstone, Arizona.  We're both history nuts, and our guide - a retired doctor who's gone about researching the peoples and places of the famed city for his own purposes - peppered his 2 and  hour presentation with modern pop culture references in order to help bring the days of the Wild West back to life.  In terms of authenticity at depicting the struggles of daily life for common folks, he rated two television programs very high.  The first - we guessed right - was DEADWOOD; the second was a bit of a welcome surprise: AMC TV's HELL ON WHEELS.HELL ON WHEELS appeared on AMC's schedule with relatively little pomp and circumstance ... at least, little by comparison to their competing programs MAD MEN and THE WALKING DEAD, which were given red carpet treatment.  The small, comfy Western's first season came and went with little critical acclaim, though it currently garners a respectable score of 63 on Metacritic's tracking poll.  Starring a practically unheard of Anson Mount in the lead, along with strong character actor Colm Meaney in a sizable secondary role, HELL ON WHEELS is `the story' of the old West, of pioneering a frontier and making it hospitable for the men, women, and children coming to populate it, all with a healthy bit of gunslinging vengeance thrown in for good measure.Cullen Bohannen (played by Mount) harbors a mystery: he's on a personal vendetta to find and kill the men who raped and murdered his wife while he was away fighting the Civil War.  In order to `fit in' inconspicuously amongst with the unruly types populating the expanding Western frontier, he takes a job as a crew chief for Thomas Durant (Meaney), rail baron.  However, Durant's sheriff - `The Swede' (Christopher Heyerdahl) - suspects Bohannen is secretly up to no good, and he goes forever out of his way to keep the man under his thumb.  The track will be laid, blood will be spilled, and vengeance will be had ... but at what costs to the players involved?What's particularly fascinating about the program is that - strictly from a character dynamic - Bohannen never knows who to trust, and this keeps the audience on the edge of its seat.  He's an effective boss, but he's constantly on his guard against others wanting the `top job' and willing to weasel it out of him.  Durant clearly suspects Bohannen's motives, but he's beholden to him at the same time for getting the tracks laid.  Lily Bell (Dominique McElligott) - a widower with strong ties to the train business - wants to trust the man, but she's drawn into her own affairs to set right the legacy of her late husband.  To its strengths, WHEELS becomes a kinda/sorta Western noir as the roles of `ally' and `adversary' always seem to be in flux for our main character.Also, the expansion of the frontier - the building of the railroad - serves as a metaphor for all the stories here.  No gains are made without great personal effort and sacrifice.  With each new stretch of track comes another turn into unsuspected treachery - be it financial, spiritual, or even territorial as the local Indian tribes seek to stop the `black beast' rampaging over their land.  But, in order to grow, something must be torn away first - or be crushed under the locomotive's mighty steam-driven wheels - and the frontier promises to always extract its price.Bohannen's primary storyline - vengeance - comes and goes throughout the course of the first season; it plays strongly into the pilot episode, as well as significantly in the season finale, but along the way he's allowed to grow a bit and come to grips with the consequences of his actions.  Where it'll all go is a mystery as the season ends on a bit of a dramatic upheaval (no spoilers, just a massive set-up that might change the stakes for all involved) ... but I'll definitely be on board once the train heads out again for the next season.If there is any weakness to the stories here, it's the prevalence of interracial relationships.  For some reason, it seems as if the writers were intent upon putting everyone through the ropes so far as `race matters' was concerned.  Granted, you've got your `whites,' your `blacks,' and your `native Americans' all thrown together at a time when the cultural melting pot was boiling on the stove, but I'd rather the program dial back the blossoming romances every-which-way and continue to tell great stories of exploration.  Bohannen's search for justice has enough teeth to carry the main narrative for a respectable amount of time; layering on secondary romance after romance only dilutes the tales into yet another `spin' on race relations that, so far, carries the same moral of the story: \"try to get along regardless of color, folks.\"  Plus, there's plenty of gibes made at the expense of the Irish.  Seriously, by the end of the season, I was hoping that the writers played out the race card so that it appears only sparingly in the episodes yet to come.  It grew tired real quick.Mount, in particular, does an impressive turn as the principle gunslinger here.  For a talent whose rarely been seen on the big and small screen, he brings a wit and a charm to his grizzled stare, and the West comes alive with the crack of his pistol.  He's an everyman plunged into an antihero's journey - a jaded past and a jaded future - every bit as mean and lean as the circumstances require of him.  Meaney feels a bit miscast, at times, but, as the season progresses, his character thankfully gets fleshed out a bit more.  The true grit here, though, goes to Heyerdahl's Swede; he chews scenery every time he's on the screen - a great foil to Mount's main thrust - and it'll be a pleasure to watch where this ticket takes him.HELL ON WHEELS is produced by a partnership of AMC with Entertainment One Television, Nomatic Pictures, (gayton)2, Endemol, Endemol Entertainment UK, and H.O.W. Productions.  DVD distribution is handled through Entertainment One.  The disc is solid with exceptional video and audio production qualities; it looks and sounds terrific.  Music is used to terrific effect throughout the first season, at times sparse and, other times, haunting.  There's a great array of special features, including several `making of' shorts and character bios as well as some additional focus providing key insight into the narrative of several episodes.  If you're looking forward to season two, then you'd do well to bone up on these in order to better grasp where the show may be headed when it comes back to the small screen.STRONGLY RECOMMENDED.  Fans of HBO's late foray into the contemporary Western DEADWOOD would do well to discover HELL ON WHEELS' charm; it isn't as obviously vulgar or gritty, but it captures the mystique of that certain time and place of the days long ago with equal emphasis on delivering a quality show with exceptional (if not minimalist) production qualities.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Foundry Communications provided me with a DVD screener of HELL ON WHEELS: COMPLETE FIRST SEASON by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review."
B0064JGWZS I truly enjoyed watching this series- it has so much going for it. The setting is the backbone of \"Hell on Wheels\", and it convincingly brings this strange community (a camp of laborers at the western frontier, where the Union Pacific Railroad is being expanded upon and slowly extending its reach across the United States) to life. I could feel the filth and desperation of this world, as well as the aching backs and blistered hands of the men who were worked to the bone by their merciless \"walking bosses\".Equally strong are the actors who were cast to bring the characters of \"Hell on Wheels\" to life. The two protagonists, Mr. Bohanan and Mr. Ferguson, are absolutely fantastic. Though deeply flawed, I could not help but find myself rooting for them... even though they were oftentimes at odds with each other, making for a somewhat muddled viewing experience. But that is by no means a complaint. This is the result of brilliant writing (and acting), and all who were involved in the process deserve to be commended for their efforts.The only thing holding this first season back from five stars is some tired cliches (the wild eyed preacher, the angry Irishman, etc.), as well as some absurdly gratuitous violence that I feel was included simply because that's the trendy thing to do on cable TV nowadays. I have no problem whatsoever with violence in media, and I thought much of it was well placed in \"Hell on Wheels\". Confrontations between Native Americans and railroad workers made sense, as did the constant disputes among laborers. But do we really need to see things like the well dressed railroad tycoon mutilating bodies in order to make for compelling newspaper photos? The answer is no, my friends. That's in there simply to get a rise out of the viewers. Ugh. Such a boring, tired concept.But by no means should you let these minor criticisms prevent you from watching this series, particularly if you're a fan of period pieces, the HBO series \"Deadwood\" (from which influence was clearly drawn), or American history. This is fantastic television- no question about it. Can't wait for season two."
B0064JGWZS The series deals with the post Civil War expansion westward through the eyes of a former Confederate soldier who lost his wife and only child to Union soldiers.  Bohannon, our hero, joins the railroad crew as he finds a clue to the death of his wife.  Working with the railroad is secondary to his own justice and revenge.Season One is tawdry, dirty, and often horrid in the showing of the wretched life and conditions these men, and many women, were subjected.  Alliances, both easy and uneasy, are born and die as quickly as they are needed or no longer useful.Hell On Wheels has a feel of grittiness from beginning to end.  Some may find this a little too overpowering for their senses. Others will enjoy the series for not sugar coating the ugliness of the times."
B0064JGWZS Hell on Wheels season 1 is raw and fast moving.  A diverse set of characters who show the mix of cultures, including prejudices, that inhabited the Union Pacific's construction camp.  Always absorbing."
B0064JGWZS Is it original? Yeah. Is it poorly done? Yes, definitely. Very bad show. It's hard to care about any of the characters. The actors are just there for a paycheck. If you're a dullard, you'll think this is a great show. If you've seen better, forget it."
B0064JGWZS Historical value. I've actually sent history students home to watch this one. Even the weapons are well thought out for this series."
B0064JGWZS As much as Cullen Bohannon's adventures are interesting, and Colm Meaney's character is compelling, and Tom Noonan is just... wacko, sadly the show doesn't work as well as it should.The show, as another reviewer here pointed out, is DEADWOOD Light. It even uses many of the same tropes as that program did (mysterious and violent yet forthright man; naive yet beautiful recent widow; SOB boss who runs everything in the surrounding area; unconventional and troubled preacher), but that's nothing revolutionary to a Western. These are pretty common all around.The story of the building and connecting of the Transcontinental Railroad is pretty darned compelling, but obviously, that needs to be dressed up a little more: The Black and Irish workers, the side-businesses in the camp, the little pieces of subterfuge and manipulation; this is apparently the drama driving the show forward. Again, sadly, it's just not compelling enough to maintain interest for those who have seen this show before and seen it better cough*DEADWOOD*cough.While freshman showrunners Tony and Joe Gayton (who also wrote the somewhat-entertaining Dwayne Johnson/Billy Bob Thornton B-movie FASTER) deserve props for doing their very best to make this look and feel authentic, the characters and the story are just too bland and too stock (much like FASTER) and the performances, with a few exceptions, don't flesh them out further. I really wanted to like this show, too, since AMC has a few of the very best shows on TV right now. I DVR'd every episode and watched the first four, but everytime I thought about watching a new episode, I just felt like it was a chore, and that is not the feeling you want when you sit down to watch TV. Oh, well."
B0064JGWZS I can not say enough great things about this series. Well written, and the actors are wonderful. I have been searching for a great western type series to watch..and Shazam, here it is. This is a must see!!"
B0064JGWZS Hell on wheels gets much better as the program progresses from one episode to the next. If you only watched the first one or two episodes you may not be very impressed with the show at first. As the episodes progress the characters get more interesting and the story as well. The only problem with this program is that they've taken on a very big subject with a very low budget. If you go to their website and look at the production information you'll see what I mean. Considering the program renewed for another season may be the budget will be bigger and the producers will be able to present a better picture of just how grueling it was to build that railroad. If the storyline has the characters stay in one location as it would appear to be headed at the end of the first season the show will probably not see a third season. With a program like Deadwood you can have a show that is primarily character driven but when you have a show about building a railroad you need more than that. Nevertheless when the program returns in early 2013 I will definitely buy it."
B0064JGWZS By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MSI'm usually a fan of shows or movies which have a basis in history. Hell On Wheels fits that mold.Producers Joe and Tony Gayton got the idea from seeing a documentary.\"We [Joe and I] started talking and remembered this story, American Experience, which was this really great documentary, and I thought, 'God, that's great. I just learned a bunch of stuff I had never learned before.' You just have this cursory information that the Chinese and the Irish built the railroad, but it got in underneath all the dirt and stuff that went on, with the financing of it, and the greed and corruption. ,\" Tony said.The lead character Cullen Bohannon (Anson Mount) is on a mission. The ex-confederate soldier is out to revenge his wife and son, who were killed by Union soldiers. He knows Union soldiers are working with the transcontinental railroad, to protect the venture from outlaws and Indians. He gets a job from Thomas \"Doc\" Durant to supervise an all-black \"cut crew.\"He meets and eventually becomes friends with Common (Elam Ferguson), a recently freed slave, who is trying to figure out what to do with his freedom.Another important character is Lily Bell (Dominique McElligott). Her husband, a surveyor was killed by Indians and she barely escaped. Her husband was partners with Doc, and he had maps which showed the course the railroad must take through the mountains. Doc courts her, mainly concerned on the front end with getting those maps.Hell On Wheels  is a great series, full of potent images, memorable characters and a story line that's believeable and rememberable. It was renewed for a second season."
B0064JGWZS Hell on wheels is a Great series, good story lines, love the chemistry of the cast. I will be getting season 2."
B0064JGWZS This is a very gritty series about building a railroad after the civil war and the trials and tribulations that the workers had to go through.  Lots of little sub-plots throughout that keep things interesting."
B0064JGWZS I very much enjoyed this fast-paced, semi-historical western series. Super exciting and full of suspense. The part I liked the most is that it wasn't like the HBO series \"Deadwood\" that throws out an F-Bomb every minute or two (literally). Sure there is some spicy talk, but it's not overdone in my opinion. There are elements (like the \"Soiled Doves\") that are just saucy enough without being disgusting. I think the blood and gore are a bit much, but every action-film is getting to be like that. Note to Hollywood filmmakers: Not everyone wants to actually SEE a man's head being blown off! We are intelligent enough to get what is happening without seeing a ton of blood and gore. So, anyway, other than a few moments where I had to close my eyes during the action scenes, I was riveted to the screen. Definitely give this series a chance. (Also, the 1st season is better than the 2nd...just FYI)."
B0064JGWZS With all the success that AMC has had recently turning out high quality adult programs such as \"Mad Men\" and \"The Walking Dead,\" few new dramas in 2011 were as eagerly anticipated as their Western revival \"Hell on Wheels.\" Despite a somewhat mixed reaction from the mainstream media, the show was an instant hit when its premiere episode became the network's second highest rated debut in history. And yet, despite these big numbers and impeccable production values, it is still very much a show that is finding its way creatively and dramatically. There are so many reasons to recommend \"Hell on Wheels\" and yet it takes a while to find its footing after a powerhouse beginning. For most of its ten episodes, I found myself admiring the show's technical construction as opposed to loving its storytelling arc.The two strongest components of the show (evident from the very beginning) were its lavish depiction of the Old West with some spectacular battles and effects and a dynamic lead villain in Colm Meaney. The story opens in a post-Civil War America with an enigmatic soldier (Anson Mount) seeking revenge for the murder of his wife by Union officers. His journey puts him in the heart of a railroad construction project led by Meaney at an untamed post on the outskirts of civilization. There are working girls, disgraced clergy, thuggish bosses, newly emancipated slaves, a Native American presence and a myriad of other unscrupulous business types coexisting in this tempestuous microcosm and seeking to exploit the new possibilities on the road west. Meaney is absolutely terrific and other notable performances are turned in by Common (unexpectedly solid as a sometimes ally of Mount) and Tom Noonan (as a preacher trying to reform his life). While the entire cast is quite good, some of the peripheral characters have yet to be developed in any meaningful way.There is no denying that \"Hell on Wheels\" is a handsome and extremely well executed from a technical standpoint. From the sets to the costumes to the effects, there are some pretty spectacular action set pieces and period recreations. It's obvious that many people love \"Hell on Wheels.\" I wished I had been more emotionally connected to the earlier episodes, it took about half of the season before I felt really invested. After that, though, I really loved much of what came next. There are so many strong elements at work here--I was willing to be patient. The skeleton for a improved second season is in place. As long as the show digs deeper into its characterizations, there's no reason to think it can't develop into one of TV's best dramas. Not fully cooked and sometimes relies on too many cliches, but it has enormous potential. And it sure does look great! KGHarris, 5/12."
B0064JGWZS This series is about the contradictions in our national history as we re recovered from the civil war,aftermath of slavery, Indian wars, personal trauma, growing industrialization. The story lines are absorbing and the acting is generally very good with particular praise for Anson Mount as Bohannon, Thor Heyerdahl as Swede, and Ted Levine as Johnson.  Levine plays a railroad overseer who turns out to have played a crucial role in the hero's traumatic past. He is outstanding in the role. I don't want to say more so as not to spoil it for those who have not yet seen the series.If you enjoy historical sagas like Deadwood, Hatfield and McCoys you will enjoy this absorbing drama."
B0064JGWZS A colleague recommended I check out this series and I'm so glad I did.  It's a great story - very different from what is on TV right now.  I will order the second season as well and try to catch the third season when it's on TV.  This was reasonably priced and a great way to be introduced to the series."
B0064JGWZS I stumbled on this series and was blown away. It is the best!  Love everything about it. Acting and casting is first rate. I love Ian Tracy and he is perfect The story is clever..  I can't wait for season 2 starting aug 12, 2012.  The scenery is gorgeous. The star is a hunk too. Can't say enough positive things about Hell on Wheels.  A wonderful example of when film is good it can be really really good!"
B0064JGWZS I wasn't expecting the solid greatness this fantastically written, directed and acted TV series gave me. Most TV westerns of recent years have been a mixed bag. Mostly short series, not ongoing like this one.AMC has really got a winner on their hands here. And thus far season 2 is just as great. If you like your characters deep, and your western action exciting, then Hell on Wheels will fill your bill."
B0064JGWZS This could have been good..it could have been great. But, in order to please blood-thirsty audiences, I assume, too many scenes were sensationalized with blood, violence, and gore and a huge turn-off."
B0064JGWZS This wasn't my favorite show, but my husband sure did like it.  If you are into watching something different, then this is a safe bet."
B0064JGWZS I loved this series on AMC! I preorder this as soon as it became available. It does suck one of my friends that played a Native American on the show had to get killed put it is what it is. If you haven't seen it.. do! It's really great! Highly recommend!"
B0064JGWZS This movie was very very good. I cannot wait to buy the second and third seasons of Hell on Wheels now."
B0064JGWZS There are some things to like in this show and some things to definitely dislike. But first off this is a tale set shortly after the American Civil War, focusing on a Confederate veteran who is seeking several men who did his deceased wife wrong. Turns out these people have gone west to work for the railroad company looking to reach the Pacific Ocean by a certain point. Of course, the tale branches off into several subplots and layered relationships. Colm Meaney, who some might remember from STAR TREK, is best known to me and plays an investor with a stake in this venture as it will hopefully make him his fortune. The outfits and looks of things feel right though the dialogue at times feels a bit too modern. It's slow in the beginning but that's because they're developing several subplots which will eventually overlap. There's some good coverage of relations between Irish and former slaves which is well done and has a great deal of truth to it for the era (both sides were competing for similar jobs), as well as the effects Manifest Destiny had upon the American Indians in the way (anybody else recognize a certain actor from LAST OF THE MOHICANS?) of progress. There are also some nice contradictions in the series, like evangelists preaching alongside hookers at work and talk of fair wages amidst rampant racism. For Deadwood fans I'd say this is better than the third season but certainly not the first and arguably a notch down from the second season. Budgetary concerns kept out Chinese Americans which got criticisms. The show is hoping to rectify this in the second season but it all depends on finances. On that note this premiere was the second most popular of AMC shows to date bringing in 4.4 million viewers. CHARACTER/DIALOGUE: B; STORY/PLOTTING: BVISUAL FEAST SCENERY POTENTIAL: B to B plus; GETS THE PERIOD RIGHT (for TV viewers): B to B plus; OVERALL GRADE: B to B plus; WHEN WATCHED: December 2011."
B0064JGWZS I really enjoy gritty westerns, epecially any with Clint Eastwood, so I like many were amazed with HBO's three season run of Deadwood. Hell on Wheels is nearly as dirty and raw, minus the language and nudity, as that show, but a couple of episodes ran rather slow and at times some scenes were unbelievable. The acting is solid throughout and the main character (featured on the DVD cover) who happens to look like Daniel Day-Lewis is someone I've never heard of before, but does a solid job. Even rapper Common proves he has some acting ability in the sidekick role.Miss Deadwood? Check out the weaker but still entertaining Hell on Wheels."
B0064JGWZS American TV continues its run of quality series with this Western set in post Civil War America.  There is a sense of the familiar in the way the episodes are put together, using the editing and music stylistic choices that have worked well in other quality TV series, but satisfyingly there is also a sense of something new, in the setting and the characters.  The setting is a gritty - well no, lets make that muddy, settlement which houses the workers on the railroad, and moves from time to time to stay where the work is - hence the title.  Into this town of ex slaves, immigrants, criminals and whores, comes an ex-Confederate soldier, on the trail of Union soldiers who murdered his wife.  However the pleasure in the series isn't this slim character arc, but rather getting to know the range of characters who subvert the usual clich&eacute;d expectations in Western - yes, we get the hooker with a heart of gold - but her history is an unexpected one, and yes, we get the lone preacher trying to convert the wretched hive of scum and villainy - but his character is also not as we at first expect.  Even Colm Meaney's magnificent railroad baron is a treat, as he defies expectations and manipulates (and occasionally is manipulated) those around him.  The head of security is a fantastic creation - The Swede, and then there is Common, playing the ex slave, and Dominique McElligott as the Englishwoman who supplies the beauty against the range of beasts on display.  They're all well drawn and well acted characters, which makes this an eminently watchable series.I had the same view as others as I watched this, that it was good to have aDeadwood: The Complete Series [Blu-ray] substitute back on screen - but in fact it's kind of unfair to compare the two.  The settings are quite different, though both maximise the drama by using a very distinct geographically bounded area to set their scene.  They are both down and dirty and show humanity at more lows than highs, but I would suggest there is a hint more optimism here, even if we still have the violence and cursing and whoring.  I am not an expert on the period, but the railroad crews are an interesting point of view to peek into this period of history and convinces as to its authenticity thanks in large part to its utterly committed cast.  I for one am looking forward to the next series..."
B0064JGWZS I admit i wasnt blown away by first episode, but it certainly builds over the season into a great show."
B0064JGWZS Well, if you are looking for a different type of Western series, this is it.  My wife doesn't usually go for Westerns but she thoroughly enjoed this production.  The basic premise is different as well as the really authentic clothing and styles.  I'm glad I didn't live back then; times were really tough and life was a major struggle. I also like Anson Mount in the lead role.  He looks and acts the part perfectly."
B0064JGWZS I love this series and had to have the discs. I plan to watch this many times over. Go Hell on Wheels!"
B0064JGWZS Hell On Wheels - The Complete First Season (2011)I stumbled upon this show by complete accident not being a regular TV viewer. I saw the title featured on Amazon and recalled seeing that term used in the book \"Nothing Like It in the World\", Stephen Ambrose's history of the trans-continental railroad. The term described the nomadic towns that sprang up and accompanied the construction of the nations railroads. I impulsively purchased the First Season and submit the following observations.I was very impressed with the sets, location and, of course, the rolling stock - trains. Having resided in the mid-west for several years - Minnesota - the Canadian prairies looked very authentic to me.From my reading the rail towns were, in fact, lawless and vice was rampant. The survivors of the Civil War, both Union and Confederates were attracted to the wide-open lifestyle. Outward expressions of racial and ethnic enmity was part of the then American culture. Of course dramatic liberties were taken but the basic social interactions portrayed reflect, I believe, the situations, as they actually existed.The actors were unknown to this viewer but were memorable for their roles particularly \"The Swede\" and Joseph Black Moon.One real attractive aspect of the box set are the behind the scenes documentaries that are included. One fact that impressed me no end was that the locomotive used in Season One was made out of wood!I just purchased Season 2 so you know I'll give this series a good rating!"
B0064JGWZS The reviews about poor historical accuracy caused me to hesitate to buy this series. Since I don't know that much about the exact history, any artistic license taken did not bother me. This show is great and the 3rd season is in my WishList."
B0064JGWZS Set Tivo to capture this show when it started and after first, set to get season pass. Interesting, well done, multiple complex character show with old West as backdrop. More than a Western. Some history that seems to ring true even if it actually isn't. Rough and tumble and bloody at times. I do like series and hope to catch all of season 2. Recommend."
B0064JGWZS I had not previously seen Hell on Wheels so ordered just Season 1 DVD'[s.  Loved it, and will probably obtain other Seasons."
B0064JGWZS Deadwood (2004-2005) was the last good &#34;authentic&#34; Western show......until now.  Hell On Wheels does an excellent (and authentic) job of re-creating the era (post-Civil War; dawn of the Transcontinental Railroad), while still mixing in enough drama, sex and intrigue to attract more than just history buffs.  All-in-all, an excellent first season; I just purchased season 2, so we'll see if the legacy continues."
B0064JGWZS Cullen Bohannan (Anson Mount) provides a most interesting protagonist in this realistic post Civil War drama/action series. Cullen is seeking revenge for the defilement and death of his wife during Sherman's destruction of Meridian, Mississippi. As Cullen gets his revenge, he comes to find out there is more to the story. He is unique in that he married a Northern woman, and freed his slaves prior to the Civil War and hired them to work his fields. He also claims no belief in God as he comes across as a second amendment atheist. Rapper Common did an excellent job as Elam.Cullen takes up with the railroad in the wild prairie land as Native American raids become one of many the dangers in this traveling road show known as \"Hell on Wheels\" which includes people who support the men such as prostitutes, preachers, and picture men.While the costume details and history appear authentic, there was one thing that caught my ear: The derogatory word for a Chinese worker (rhymes with clink). The first known use of the word was in 1890. The film starts in 1865. Appears to be some sloppy research.My main criticism of the series is that it moves at a slow soap opera pace.No f-bombs, sex, or nudity in the pilot. Things get a little spicier in the series."
B0064JGWZS Hell on Wheels is set several years after the USA Civil War and concerns the struggles of building the transcontinental railroad.  An interesting time period to explore and very well done set pieces.  It's just shy of HBO's Deadwood in terms of authenticity and character but if you enjoy this time period or \"the old west\" you will enjoy this show.  Good job AMC!"
B0064JGWZS In comparison with much of what is available in the way of westerns, this is a minimally acceptable series.  The plot is interesting, the actors moderately competent, and the set designs and photography convincing.  Obviously, this series is a milksop imitation of Deadwood.  Deadwood was a ten; Wheels is a five.  Unforgivably, the depictions of Native American culture are offensive.  Such caricatures would be expected in a 1940's John Wayne oater but are both atavistic and ridiculous in modern productions.Still, there is enough of interest in Wheels to warrant viewing (if nothing better is available and one is relatively desperate for escapism)."
B0064YPHEK Love the Nature series. Its educational, enlightening and entertaining. There are even some episodes I'm not sure i want to watch ...but they suck me in and i end up enjoying."
B0064YPHEK I liked the premise at the beginning of following the raccoons given collars, but then the focus shifted to other cities.  By the time it shifted back to the Toronto study there was not enough time to get much information.  I think it would have been more interesting to focus on the original study with perhaps just a few remarks about the Japanese and German ones."
B0064YPHEK Is this show about nature or about man involving himself in nature. In episode 1 a terrible narrator who talks way too much throughout the documentary speaks for 15 minutes about how he is within 15 meters of the eagle and the eagle is staring at him. Episode 2 is about a lonely man that raises a dozen wild turkeys from birth. You never actually learn anything except that the man is sad when he loses his turkeys. This show seems more about the people filming them than about nature."
B0064YPHEK What a great series!  I will watch it again and again.  One photographer dug a four foot by four foot pit and lived in it for seven months to get a shot of Siberian tigers!  It's a great series."
B0064YPHEK The nature series is very entertaining while enlightening and does pass on a lot of knowledge. This series should be in curriculums in elementary school."
B0064YPHEK The doucmentary was good.  Interesting but not in great detail.  The poor video quality made it hard to watch.  Interesting about the Harpy Eagle, but I had to go to other websites to get more detailed information"
B0064YPHEK I love Nature but do not have cable TV or a local PBS station to watch so I was happy to see it on Amazon Prime but sadly not a lot of episodes.  Hope they add more at some point."
B0064YPHEK it is just great nature show...heads above those on animal planet and other channels similar such as discovery etc.  watch it"
B0064YPHEK The particular episode I watched about odd animal friends was so heartwarming and so different to see animals grow up together that would usually be enemies.sometimes it's like humans if you aren't yet taught to hate you don't know you aren't supposed to be friends."
B0064YPHEK I like this series. Each episode is interesting and some of them are downright fun! They're not controversial at all."
B0064YPMOU It's so hard to know what is really going on in wars, until we can look back with 20/20 vision at these documentaries.  This series gives a voice to the truth.  My parents said they had no real knowledge of the truth about the Viet Nam war while it raged on and on.I'm a nurse and for many years I've been thanking the few Nam war vets who have been in my care because I knew about the terrible home-coming they received and I truly admired and appreciated the service they gave our country..  As I held the hand of one vet and thanked him..he said: &#34;No one has ever said that to me before.&#34;  to which I replied: &#34;Well..they should have.&#34;Presidents Johnson and Nixon were two of the worst leaders and liars America had seen in it's president's up to that time.  We've had worse since then with the Bush administrations and now we have the worst leader in history with &#34;Puppet&#34; President Obama.In President Kennedy's own words in filmed speeches, he was set against sending troops to Viet Nam.  I believe that is partly why U.S. political forces failed to protect him and helped arrange to have him killed. Who is REALLY running this country and who is really putting these kinds of men into office?  Is it really the voters??"
B0064YPMOU I was still in High School when that war ended for the US but had some recollection of events both in the classroom and newspapers and broadcasts.  I also have an older brother who served two tours there.  This was an amazing piece of documentary work.  Both the visual content and narration was amazing.  I really can;t say enough about this series.  Watch it."
B0064YPMOU This was an excellent series and I highly recommend it to anyone with an interest in this war and the struggles our Soldiers and country faced."
B0064YPMOU One of the best documentaries on the Vietnam War.  Extensive coverage, thoughtful interviews and good footage.  The editing was better than I expected.  Overall, outstanding."
B0064YPMOU I enjoyed watching the series. I enjoy Vietnam movies. I grew up watching the war on television and worrying that I would be drafted into the war. The war ended before I finished high school. Confusing time in America during the war with the protests against war, civil rights movements and riots. It was good to see the soldiers point of view from the private up to the general."
B0064YPMOU decent real footage and objective reporting. Welcome the insertion of facts and events that were not presented before, butexisted non-the-less."
B0064YPMOU *Added 21 January 2014: The latest reviews offer an interesting insight into this series. There are even more reviews than expected and they are less critical! During WWII the 'enemy' was obvious. Vietnam is more easily compared to Afghanistan.Original review date 14 September 2013:How to explain our involvement in Vietnam? How to explain our country divided? This is a beginning to try and help one understand the reality . . .  my generations's war. Photographs and video footage bring a reminder of what happened but cannot give back the lives lost. Familiar and yet different, an intimate view of what happened and what was to come. I found the narration to be well done even it didn't always match the footage. The nightmare scenarios followed one after another and the lessons were learned too late. Who they were, where they were from and what they did, create a video worth watching/listening.['Army Brat' . . . both daughter and wife]The wrenching reality of this series is by far superior to most Vietnam documentaries. The original review remains as written and I have chosen to append these comments after purchasing and viewing the entire series. My own knowledge came from those who served 'in country,' veteran sites and archives. For those who want a simplified comprehensive assessment, this series presents an overwhelming abundance of information for both the personal and political overview.  Thank you to all those who served our country and to those that made this documentary possible."
B0064YPMOU I felt this was the best Vietnam War documentary I've ever seen.  Not only is the war in Vietnam given a broad look, but also what was going on back in the states, and how our vets were treated."
B0064YPMOU A very good albeit short history of the Vietnam war.  Some not before seen footage.  Worth a watch."
B0064YPMOU Very well done. The film footage show a lot of what was happening and took me back to the way things were."
B0064YPMOU This  series should be required viewing for any politician that wants to get the US  into another war.  Very moving sequences and personal  experiences.  Some of the footage was shown repeatedly."
B0064YPMOU This is an older program that aired some time back.  It provides a good and accurate summary of the history and politics of the Vietnam war."
B0064YPMOU Well written and documented with very good images.  It took me back to 1969 very quickly and my time there."
B0064YPMOU I grew up during this war and remember watching some of the things mentioned during tv newscasts. I am not sure how exact it is historically but I feel like it was a good representation of the series of events that happened during this time period in American history"
B0064YPMOU Absolutely fantastic! Shows the real war as it was, not as it was portrayed to be by our government. If you are a war historian then you need to see this program!"
B0064YPMOU This is a greats series. It gives the viewers insights into the minds of the young men and women who served and fought in the Viet Nam war. I am a history buff and study a lot about this period in American history (my father served in Viet Nam in 1966)."
B0064YPSRG This is a quirky romantic comedy about a young man in New York City, who is a pickpocket. He meets a woman and has a passionate affair on a one night stand. She finds out she's pregnant and confronts him with choices and challenges he must make in order to continue the relationship. Very funny, Enjoyable, and Entertaining. Highly Recommended!"
B0064YPSRG First of all, don't pay any attention to any bad reviews, I seriously doubt these people actually watchedthis movie. For an independent, it was quite a surprise. Facinelli does a terrific job with the screenplay abouta pickpocket trying to pay off his Father's $500,000 debt to scumbag Vincent Gallo. Along the way, he manages tolift a badge from Michael Madsen, who works for acknowledged superfreak William Forsythe (in a very subdued role)and then all hell breaks loose.As our lead is being pursued by seemingly the entire NY City police force, his mom breaks bad with Joe Pantoliano,and he \"accidentally\" bumps into and falls in love with the beautiful, but recently impregnated, Jaimie Alexander,with whom he had a one night fling then apparently forgot about.The writing is tight, the characters are well cast, there is humor, drama, intrigue, and romance, and this is MichaelMadsen's best role since ... well since hell I cant remember... a long damn time.Anybody that doesn't like this movie needs their heads examined. For its budget, a solid 4.5 stars."
B0064YPSRG LOOSIES like so many other art house films that take a while to build an audience, but then enjoy a faithful following. But this film is a real find: Peter Facinelli is known to everyone as the head of the Cullen Clan in the vampire TWILIGHT series and as the goofy delusional doc on the NURSE JACKIE TV series (and from roles in a lot of small films where he didn't get the notice he deserved). But who could tell that this tall stud muffin natural comedian could also write? Facinelli came up with the story and wrote the screenplay for LOOSIES and he also stars as the main character - and he is a hands-down winner in each category. Director Michael Corrente seems to let Facinelli have the film and he plays it to the hilt while at the same time molding into a solid ensemble of fine actors.Bobby (Peter Facinelli) is a young pickpocket in New York City, snatching wallets, cellphones, briefcases and money as slick as any pro could perform. He lives with his mother Rita (Marianne Leone, wife of Chris Cooper!) and follows his life of petty crime to pay off his recently deceased father's gambling debt. All his work is turned over to Jax (Vincent Gallo), a filthy clod of a guy who berates Peter's inability to go big time in theft. Bobby is a fairly happy-go-lucky guy until he accidentally encounters Lucy (Jaimie Alexander), a beautiful girl who works in a bar but who Booby happened to have a memorable one-night stand with three months ago. Lucy confronts Bobby, Bobby doesn't remember her name, and when Lucy informs him that their little tryst created a pregnancy, Booby tries to do the right thing and find the money to give Lucy to 'take care of the pregnancy'. This leads to a serious of crazy events: Bobby needs big money, mistakenly lifts a police badge form a cop (Michael Madsen) whose boss (William Forsythe) threatens to fire him unless he can get his badge back. The 'cops and robbers' scene plays out: Lucy doesn't want to be associated with a pickpocket despite the fact there is a newly rediscovered chemistry with the changing Bobby, Bobby resents his mother's finding a boyfriend Carl (Joe Pantoliano) who owns a jewelry store, but plans a gig with Jax to work a deal with Carl to get the cops off his tail and allow him to become the guy he really wants to be.How Bobby makes his way through this complex plot is the magic of the fine writing and the first class acting by the surprisingly hunky Facinelli. Jaimie Alexander is a terrific find, and the cameo roles by Vincent Gallo, Marianne Leone, Joe Pantoliano et al are beautifully realized. 'Loosies', by the way, is the term for loose cigarettes that people can but without investing in a pack. Seeing the film, titled so appropriately, will make the audience sit up and pay attention to Peter Facinelli in a totally new realm of respect. He is VERY good! Grady Harp, April 12"
B0064YPSRG For some writer's block reason a skilled pickpocket doesn't understand high school biology about reproduction and gets a girl pregnant and doesn't understand how it was possible. Duh! Anyway, tediously long script showing the pickpocket art of stealing cellphones to pay a debt to a not-so-nice fence while running from the cops. Stereotypes of coping with the girl's pregnancy and dragging her into the fray only to have her turn his life around. Usual stereotypes of dumb cops, double crosses and redemption. Actors were cast for their respective roles by looks and the robotic acting showed why, Twilight obsessed vamps notwithstanding.A bit concerned with the consistent and continual portrayal throughout the movie that lying, stealing, avoiding responsibility, drinking, bad parenting all were shown in a positive light while the cops come out as conniving drinking dumbasses."
B0064YPSRG A hardly memorized movie of a not-so-bad looking guy avoiding sexual encounters while a story is about his choices as he was accused in making one pregnant during a one night stay.Not much at all."
B0064YPSRG Nice little romantic \"comedy\". One of those where things just go from bad to worse and one has to shake one's head. Liked both main characters and think they did decent acting jobs. Could be a data movie for 25 - 30's.  Recommend as entertainment."
B0064YPSRG I have to say that I am a huge fan of Peter Facinelli, having said that this movie could not have entertained me any more. He did a superb job with the part as did the rest of the cast."
B00669UD0Q A Lonely Place To Die is a solid film.  It's about a group of young Scottish hikers programmed for adventure.  They're quite happy about their journey at first... until one guy from the group goes to take a leak and hears the faint sounds of a little girl crying for help.  They then realize the girl is underground so they dig and dig... and eventually find her.  However there's no time to celebrate I'm afraid, as it's quickly discovered that these hikers are being hunted by two crazy men with guns and a Russian accent (at least I think it's Russian).For the first half of the movie, these hikers are literally running and climbing rocks for their lives as the crazy gunmen continue to stand around, reload and fire at their targets, and hey, if they intended to wipe out the hikers backpacks, they succeeded with flying colors, har har!Anyway the hikers are now on a mission to protect the little girl that they freed and saved from the underground box she was forced to squeeze into, and after the first half with all that intense mountain climbing and careful maneuvering the storyline eventually rolls into town... not sure *which* town exactly, but the gameplan remains the same- protect the girl no matter what.  Unfortunately  now the gunmen are more aggressive than ever.You see apparently the little girl is valuable but I wasn't really sure in what way, and if her importance was explained I didn't catch it (and I even tried as hard as I could to understand the accent of the two gunmen but every so often a few hard to comprehend lines were thrown in there).There's some really graphic segments in this movie.  The one that surprises me the most is the one where two of the hikers were simply climbing down from a mountain and suddenly the guy standing on top of the rocks falls down the mountain to his death on a row of rocks beside a river.  It's an amazingly graphic scene and makes me sick when you realize how fragile life can be for a mountain climber- one wrong move and that's it, you're done.  The woman who was positioned halfway down the mountain turns around and sees her friend falling as it happens, and she lets out a terrifying and realistic scream that really bothers me.Overall, I really like this movie.  The Scottish accents are easy to understand, the woman most persistent on protecting the female child is really beautiful, the acting is fantastic, the action and suspense is constant, and it's just a wonderful movie."
B00669UD0Q This movie requires patience, but if you don't have it just fast forward till it looks interesting.  This is a decent thriller, but not overly thrilling.  I just couldn't get into the characters.  I watched it but I found myself fast forwarding which I don't do very often.  I think perhaps this movie needed better editing, there was to much footage of mountain scenery, parade, et cetera.  Had they trimmed there and developed the characters more it would have been better.  It doesn't take all that much to figure out what is going on, and they dragged us with all the extra footage.  There are some great scenes of them escaping the bad guys, but they needed a bad guy boss on the scene with some character.  The bad guys are okay but nothing made me think, oh those guys really scare me (see John Lithgow's great performance in Cliffhanger).  In fact I think they were made to look so cold blooded I just didn't care about them at all.  The five people on the mountain are decent, but only a couple I halfway felt I knew a little by the end.  The police that try to help are barely developed so once again they are okay.  They needed more screen time because I started to like the black cop, but didn't get time to really know him.  The girls father at the end was more interesting because you could feel his intensity.  All-in-all a pretty decent movie but it had a lot more potential had they developed more of the characters and spent less time on the surroundings. I love scenery and sets, but they don't make the movie, the actors and story do.  At this less than seven dollar price it is worth buying.Recommendations:Shoot to Kill,Cliffhanger, andThe Eiger SanctionCA Luster"
B00669UD0Q In the immortal words of Charlie Brown,\"Argh!\".  This film is terrific for its first two-thirds.  Director Julian Gilbey wratchets the tension in this portion immeasurably.  Gilbey seems to be taking his cues from John Boorman's \"Deliverance\" and Walter Hill's \"Southern Comfort\" in exploring the age old themes of man versus an unforgiving natural terrain combined with threats from his fellow man.  It's in the film's final third where things go terribly awry.  It's here where the film devolves into a second rate \"Taken\" that makes little narrative sense.  I'm ambivalent about recommending this movie.  If you must proceed there's a lot of good stuff but you have to divorce it from the dross."
B00669UD0Q A Lonely Place To Die is a very Atmospheric film that not only has beautiful scenery and cinematography but also packs a punch as far as storyline and execution.The Acting is first rate and it is what it is, there really aren't any big aha moments or unexpected twists.The group of mountain climbers are in a race for their lives and the life of the little girl they saved from a man made underground prison.Many lives will be lost be it the pursuers and /or the Climbers.The main question is why do the men with heavy artillery chasing them want the girl so bad,where did she come from and will she be returned safety and will any of the climbers be alive to make sure she is?One of the best adventure/suspense thrillers of the year in my opinion because it's no nonsense and cuts right to the literal chase.There is quite a bit of violence and blood but nothing that put's it in Slasher mode although I have seen many slashers with less blood.Bottom line it's well worth a rent and even a buy."
B00669UD0Q There have been some number of adventure thrillers where mountain climbing is at the heart. For my dollar this is well worth seeing.Here's the scoop. Five friends start out to climb a mountain. By pure chance they come across a young girl held in a makeshift underground vault. They realize she's been kidnapped for ransom and proceed to free her and make their way off the mountain, only to find her kidnappers are on their tail. Who will prevail in this game of cat and mouse?Given the mediocre reviews I almost didn't hit the play button on this. I was glad I did. It's better than I anticipated. It's directed and shot well. Great respect is shown for the mountains and landscapes. It gives the viewer a good sense of nature without looking like a travelogue. The pursuit is generally pretty good. There were a couple of cheap shots in the script. Face it. Playing the gun jamb card at a crucial part of the proceedings just doesn't cut it any more. But a lot of nifty things do happen elsewhere. Making the kidnapped girl an Eastern European, with the subsequent communication barrier causing more problems, was a nice touch. Things DID get a bit muddy for me when the guys with the ransom money enter the fray. I had a difficult time hearing what they were saying so I think I missed out on some important stuff.The acting by the climbers, particularly Melissa George, was pretty good. The bad guys didn't do much more than shoot their guns so it's hard to gauge their acting skills.This isn't quite worth the 4 stars I gave it but it's certainly better than 3. If you like action/adventure flicks you could do much worse."
B00669UD0Q Tossing bits of formula storyline into a box and shaking it does not produce anything but jumbled stuff. Just a few examples follow even though the entire movie is poorly edited, directed and the acting came across as actors just acting the roles and not understanding the roles. This potpourri strains credulity which for this type of movie you have to have.(1.) Pointless most of the first half hour showcasing partying at a climbing lodge. Helicopter scenic shots of hills, birds and the usual vehicle on a road. Overbearing drum and piano pounding sound effects to create tension when the acting and story is flat.(2.) Lots of scenes of Scottish Highlands at camera angles that made hills look like mountains; streams look like white water rapids. Pointless time spent on a very small town pagan honorific festival with fireworks made to look like New York City July 4th, all through different angles of the same firework. Lots of scenes of climbing equipment being assembled with multiple camera angles; turning a 30' drop into one that looked much further.(3.) People seem to repeatedly always show up at the same location despite the remote isolation. The first was our climbing group coincidentally finding a girl buried underground in a forest with only a small breathing pipe. The second that two hunters happen to be in the same spot. Then two more just walk up at the same remote spot and kill those hunters. then these two always seem to show up at the same location as our climbing party which has now split into two groups going in different directions yet all three groups seem to show up at the same location. Clever editing, in this case, made instanteous space travel possible.(4.) Buried girl is a kidnapped Serb Croatian - of course, since that's a currently popular ethnic plot point in movies. How the girl looks clean and fresh after being buried for days and the 3 inches of forest ground cover above her box looks undisturbed is quite a burying trick. She could have just pushed the lid up.(5.) Same girl is swept downstream and ends up underwater for ten minutes yet is revived by just breathing into her lungs. Hello, she should be dead and besides her lungs should have had water in them which needed to be cleared out first. When she revives it's as if she's waking from a nap.(6.) Climber falls down a hill and severely breaks an arm but later he using it just fine, then he says it was his leg that's broken so then he starts limping even though he was running previously when it was suppose to be his arm.(7.) Female climber is upstairs in an apartment that's engulfed in flames. She passes out, but in the next scene firemen are carrying her away. Such fast firemen (more editing) yet when the gunmen (who again seem to always know where to be) are going through the town shooting anyone they don't like, the police are no where to be seen.The ending reflected the movie in that it made little sense and went nowhere. Seemed like an afterthought finish. Great, and even good, movies pay attention to details and not just assume the audience is a bunch of not-paying attention toadstools."
B00669UD0Q By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MSThe Gilbey brothers, Julian and Will, almost didn't get to see their vision of A Lonely Place To Die, come to fruition. During one of the numerous climbing sequences a boulder came crashing down, almost hitting the production team.The film which was filmed in the Scottish highlands focuses on five mountaineers, who get caught up in fight-to survive the elements and ruthless killers.The climbers rest at the top of the ridge when Alison (Melissa George) tells the rest of the gang to be quiet, that she hears something.Soon the group discover a vent pipe coming out from under the ground with a weak voice coming from beneath. They dig, uncovering a chamber with a young Serbian girl inside. She can't speak English and they can't speak Serbian but they slowly become aware that she has been hidden away as part of a kidnapping plot.Miles from civilization the hikers must decide what to do. Knowing the danger, some want to abandon the girl saying \"at least she's free from her containment.\" But conscience prevails and they concur they must become reluctant heroes. The girl has no experience climbing. The terrain is unforgiving so they split up with two going for help, while the other follow a longer but safer path to the nearest community.The kidnappers return, armed to the teeth and start the deadliest of hunts.This is a terrifying cat and mouse where the obstacles are steep, the prey unarmed and the odds astronomical.This is a sleeper, must-see thriller."
B00669UD0Q Good, solid, tough, very brutal and action packed thriller about a deadly encounter in Scottish Highlands...This is a very good albeit VERY brutal British thriller, with good actors and a strong scenario, all of which is placed amongst breathtakingly beautiful landscapes.Of all the actors, before watching this film I knew only Melissa George (i saw her in &#34;Triangle&#34;), but everybody plays well. My favourite characters were Jenny (Kate Magowan), the older of the two women, who left her daughter with grandparents to relax a couple of days in the mountains in company of her significantly older husband and then Ed (Ed Speelers), frequently wise-cracking and occasionally annoying slacker, who once had a Croatian girlfriend who used to scream at him a lot in Serbo-Croatian...)))About the scenario, without revealing anything else than what is said on the back cover of the DVD, I will just say that it begins with five friends, three men and two girls, hiking in the wilderness of Scottish Highlands. They are all good people and the introduction, even if it is short, manages pretty well to establish a connection between the viewers and the five heroes. The place they have chosen to hike is so remote, that there is no cell phones service or Internet available and even the GPS plays tricks...Then suddenly the five heroes discover someting in the middle of the forest... And once they discovered it, the film really begins, because now some other people simply CAN NOT let them leave the wilderness alive...I am absolutely not saying anything about what will happen next, but believe me, if you like action packed thrillers you REALLY want to see this film. The scenario is really solid and the tension is maintained to the end. The villains are extremely bad people, but unlike in so many American films they can also speak - and what they have to say is as interesting as it is shocking...The finale of this film is particularly good - and shocking. Frankly, at the very end I felt a very cold shiver on my back... The conclusion of the film could be that if you really want to steal a dragon's egg, you should first be CERTAIN that you can outfight, outrun or outsmart the wyrm... Because woe to you if you can not...Music is rather discreet but in the moments it appears, it is very skilfully chosen to fit the landscapes or the action. In the beginning and expecially in the end we can hear absolutely splendid traditional Scottish songs, one of them dating from Jacobite wars. I liked them greatlyA very important warining here - this film is extremely BRUTAL and minors should not watch it in any circumstances.Bottom line, this is a good, solid and very BRUTAL action thriller and I am very pleased that I watched it. Enjoy!"
B00669UD0Q A LONELY PLACE TO DIE is an intense action thriller buoyed by breathtaking climbing sequences and quick-paced action sequences.  Set in the gorgeous Scottish Highlands, the film follows five mature adults on a climbing vacation who stumble upon a little girl buried underground, obviously a victim of kidnapping.  Their decision to rescue the child propels them into a cat and mouse confrontation with the deadly and relentless kidnappers.What elevates this sharp indie is the characters are believable and empathic, even if we don't get a lot of background we do care about them and want them to come out on top.  Director Julian Gilbey expertly keeps the tension intact and elicits strong performances from his talented cast.Melissa George (TRIANGLE, BAG OF BONES) gives an outstanding committed performance as the feisty but sensitive Allison.  Ed Speelis is good as the roguish Ed who experiences a sudden and required maturity.  Sean Harris oozes chilli9ng venom as evil Mr. Kidd and Karel Roden quietly compelling as Darko, the negotiator.  Eammon Walker and Alec Newman round out the cast.  Holly Boyd is effective as the kidnapped child.A LONELY PLACE TO DIE is dark and an ultimate downer.  Its also an expertly filmed thriller worthy of more attention."
B00669UD0Q A Lonely Place to Die is a movie best seen knowing as little as possible about it so, if you've avoided learning about the plot so far, just watch the movie. It plays with expectations and conventions to appear to morph from genre to genre while actually staying true to its own story. It's an adventure tale that moves along briskly without dawdling where it shouldn't and without rushing, either. The few very, very slight missteps are only apparent in contrast to the assuredness of the rest of the film and they pass, quickly to be forgotten. The Scottish Highlands setting verges on beautiful familiarity but reveals strangely beautiful alienness as the film progresses. The action and stuntwork in the film remains at a human level and is all the more effective for it."
B00669UD0Q If you are looking for a movie to add to your movie night, try this one you will love it. I watch this on Netflix, thinking it may have been poor entertainment, I was wrong. Its  starts of with 5 hiker's in the mountains; when they hear the cry of what seem to be a young girl crying for help. Then everything spirals down hill from there, I won't spoil the movie you won't be disappointed. Although, I felt the ending could have been better ,but still a great movie."
B00669UD0Q It focuses on a group of people who hike into the mountains and find a young girl buried under the ground... alive... they dig her out and try to get her to safety... TRY is the key word... someone is hunting them."
B00669UD0Q This was a good popcorn thriller. Nothing more.The acting was good, story line had some holes but what film that we love doesn't?I can confidently recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good adventure film but isn't looking too closely at the cosmetics.Should give it 4 stars but, meh, it will find its viewership.Worth it if you can find it under $10."
B00669UD0Q \"She's our responsibility now. We've got to get her off this mounting as soon as possible.\" When a group of mountain climbers out for a weekend of fun hear a sound in the forest they begin to investigate. When they find a little girl held prisoner in a small chamber they decide to rescue her. While trying to get her to freedom the hunters decide that a group is more fun to hunt then one little girl. This is a very frustrating movie to watch. The beginning was very tense and has you interested almost immediately. You feel like you can't catch your breath the entire time and are really rooting for the crew. Then with about a half hour left the movies stumbles badly and turns into something completely different and is barely able to hold your attention until the end. If I judged the movie based off the first hour I would definitely say watch this. Based off the ending I would say watch it still, but shut it off with a half hour left and have someone tell you the ending. Very disappointing. Overall, a very good movie for most of it. I give it a B- (would have been higher if ending was better.)"
B00669UD0Q Five mountaineers in the Scottish Highlands inadvertently get involved in a crime when they rescue a kidnapped Serbian girl in the woods. Following the tradition of thriller genre that is best represented by John Boorman classic \"Deliverance,\" Julian Gilbey's movie \"A Lonely Place to Die\" starts out promisingly, but rapidly descends into a series of nonsense.I can generally ignore plot holes as long as a film is good enough to entertain us. Unfortunately, \"A Lonely Place to Die\" is not good in most aspects. Action is mostly derivative with cardboard characters that cannot make a sensible decision even when \"villains\" are not around. Melissa George plays Alison, a seasoned mountain climber who should have known that climbing down a cliff is not a very good idea when some criminals responsible for the girl's imprisonment might be back in any minute.The film ditches its original idea of the cat-and-mouse thriller in the Scottish mountains in its third act, where things get even more ridiculous and confusing. Without spoiling much, all I can say is that a third party arrives in the climax that is padded out with drawn-out dialogues and unexciting action sequences involving guns.Obviously there is the potential for an intense thriller, which seems buried somewhere in \"A Lonely Place to Die.\""
B00669UD0Q The idea of taking someone and hiding them away until the ransom is collected is not new, and that is the main story here.  What is new, though, is the fact that they are hidden underground in a remote area in the mountains and found by mountain climbers/hikers.It does get very gory at times but you have to expect that from the contract killers/goons who took the young girl to begin with."
B0066SB8UQ You really can't go wrong with the Green Lantern Corps at all. Like to see this animated series do well and continue to evolve."
B0066SB8UQ keep the story  going  the rumor is your going to end the show after this season. that would be less than smart"
B0066SB8UQ If you have even a passing interest in the DC Universe or Green Lantern. You really must watch this show. From the beginning. You'll be so hooked. AND, you'll love it. On par or a bit better than Avenger's the Earth's Mightiest Heroes. Even better than the new Green Arrow adult show Arrow. Basically uses Geoff Johns inventive creations and condenses the story from the comic book series."
B0066SB8UQ This has to be the best animated adventure out there. It has a story plot that goes on and weaves it way through the story line. it has drama, adventure, action,heart and a love story of sorts as well without getting sappy and did i mention a actual story line ! Not just thrown together it is great. by the series it will be a great addition to your library"
B0066SB8UQ I checked out the pilot when I saw Sam Liu and Bruce Timm were involved, was immediately hooked and got an amazon video pass for the whole season.  At first I was skeptical of the 3D animation medium, especially since it's been done so badly before with superheroes (iron man, spiderman), but the simplified palette and detail characterized by Timm's style translated perfectly into the 3D medium.  What sealed the deal was they that they didn't skimp on details, such as the perfect syncing of the facial expressions and mouth movement to the dialog, the models being complex enough to give very human like expressions.  Clearly some pixar-level talent was involved in this series.  The art and style of this series is sublime, worthy to stand among the other feature-length animated superhero films from Sam Liu in the last half-decade.Aside from surface details, the voice acting is top-notch and the stories are amazingly well done.  The antimonitor arc was engaging and enjoyable.  It brought back some decades old memories of these green lantern stories and honors them with this modern re-imaginination."
B0066SB8UQ Ragnar, brother of Queen Iolande of Betrassus, has received a red ring as a result of his fury and jealousy at his sister's being chosen as a Green Lantern. Now the crew of the Interceptor must return to Betrassus and stop him. Meanwhile, all is not well among the on Oa. Apa, leader of the Guardians of the Universe, is determined to take down Ganthet (voiced by the late Ian Abercrombie, to whom the episode is dedicated) for embracing a \"base emotion\". Determined to help Hal Jordan and his friends, Ganthet reveals that he placed a \"protoype\" on the Interceptor before its departure based on the interaction between willpower and that \"base emotion\"...hope.The mythology of the Green Lantern comics is at its strongest in this episode, as is the quality of the show as a whole. New plot threads are added to the ever-expanding storyline of the series. The stage is set for yet another Lantern Corps to enter the mix. And the war with the Red Lanterns grows even more serious and deadly. It would appear that this season is building towards quite an exciting climax."
B0066SB8UQ I hope they make a second season.  My favorite character was not the main character, but the red lantern.  He was cooler."
B0066SB8UQ Really good series it's like a cartoon version of the movie but deeper the animation is also done well with good scripts and voices it give you a closer look on how green lantern is and the enemies he comes in contact with."
B0066SB8UQ This a good, family friendly show for all ages.  I especially like how this TV series brings together all aspects of the Green Lantern series."
B0066SB8UQ Forget what you saw in the Green Lantern movie!  This cartoon is true to it's comic book origins.  The CGI is perfect for this intergalactic cartoon.  The Green Lantern Corps is perfectly portrayed in this animation breakthrough. Think Incredibles style animation and quality on a weekly basis. That's how good this cartoon is!  This one is worth the price of admission.  If you like the comic book genre and a well written and acted cartoon, this one is a keeper!  Attention is paid to the character development and villains that are worthy adversaries to the hero.  This one doesn't try to dumb down the characters for a young audience. Adults and kids will watch this again and again!"
B0066SB8UQ I love being able to share some of my comic book heroes with my son who is 9 years old. Of course he thinks I should give it a 5 star review."
B0068ZCCA2 as always - great twists & turns and great challanges - never gets old to watch people being so sneaky."
B0068ZCCA2 My husband and I just started watching this show because it was on Prime.  We are hooked to the whole series!!  Best long running reality tv!"
B0068ZCCA2 I've seen several seasons of survivor.  This season was the most unsuspecting, full of surprise episodes.  Fabio's win was a perfect play using the &#34;below the radar&#34; technique.  The characters played well.  Some over played, and some simply quit playing.  Age did not matter.  All in all, Fabio's last 3 immunity wins played a factor in winning the game."
B0068ZCCA2 If you like watching people succeed at their lowest common denominator this season is for you.  There veiled bigotry, thievery, childish behavior, and selfishness.  The hungrier the contestants got the meaner they got with each other.  The black girl was an embarrassment to her race.  The old guy did nothing to assist his team in getting any rewards but he felt that he should have gone to the final three.  The nice guy would have finished last in a real life survivor situation but this case he didn't finish at all."
B0068ZCCA2 I would really like to see much earlier survivor shows, starting with the first season since I never got to watch those."
B0068ZCCA2 I am glad I didn't have to wait from week to week to find out what would happen next. Very enjoyable to watch from the comforts of my home."
B0068ZCCA2 I really love the Survivor series. I like how they switched up the tribes; older and younger. It's kind of unfair to separate young vs. old but Survivor isn't about being fair and it was entertaining to watch."
B0068ZCCA2 This is the first season of survivor my GF and I have ever watched, so we actually wanted to give the show five enthusiastic stars because survivor rocks. Now that we have seen some of the other classic, more widely beloved seasons we think that three stars is a better review of Nicaragua. I don't want to give away spoilers but some of the contestants don't seem like they really want to be there, the strategy is pretty pathetic for survivor standards, and the weather is rainy for pretty much the whole season which doesn't bother me on my couch too much but it was pretty draining for the contestants."
B0068ZCCA2 Watching Boston Rob play Survivor is amazing!  A lot of crazy characters on this season makes it so much fun to watch!"
B0068ZCCA2 Always enjoy watching survivor. Jeff has kept the adventures intriguing. Recommend all seasons that are currently available. Watch and enjoy."
B0068ZCCA2 This is a fun show to watch with young teen agers. We enjoyed it and watched some of the episodes together."
B0068ZCCA2 I will always give survivor 5 stars! I am a fan since the very first season like a lot of people! Some seasons are better than others but I have never found a season I didn't like!"
B0068ZCCA2 Watchable, adequately entertaining, recycled challenges.  Players were not especially appealing and I never developed even a remote favorite.  Several players were so annoying that I wished I could have voted them off myself.  The three finalists?  Ho-hum.  Cinematography was well done and Jeff was more animate than usual."
B0068ZCCA2 BEST REAL TV SERIES YET."
B0068ZCCA2 I didn't get a chance to watch this series when it was on network tv.  But I have enjoyed watching it on Amazon especially since there aren't any commercials."
B0068ZCCA2 I haven't watched Survivor much because it seems to bring out the worst in people.  Did make an exception and watched this season to see if anything had changed and was glad to see that the most deserving person won.  Congrats to all the survivors and well played."
B006DUK1K0 I watched this not knowing what to expect.  I found it entertaining and telling a story of life in a french brothel at the turn of the century.  It turned out better than I expected when I first started watching it."
B006DUK1K0 I accidentally started this when scanning through so I can't rate it. Sometimes the movie starts when I'm trying to slide through the selections."
B006DUK1K0 I have not watched this performance I it's entirety.  Interesting watching movie with sub titles.  Intend on seeing whole movie."
B006DUK1K0 ... it is not totally surprising that life in a brothel at the turn of the century was no bed of roses (or in any brothel today except maybe the Nevada houses which seem to always have a camera trained on the smiling whores), but the depiction of a lady's first encounter with sadism is shocking, and the mood pervades the rest of the flick. The symbolic &#34;emerald&#34; is confusing."
B006DUK1K0 This movie makes absolutely no sense.  It's about a bunch of 19th century hookers.  Thought it might be an interesting topic and go into other aspects of history--but no.  It's just about the hookers.  Don't waste your time."
B006DUK1K0 Very slow moving plot if there is one.  Trying to tell to many stories and really not showing anything really grabs you."
B006DUK1K0 Didn't hold my interest and turned off the film after the first five minutes.  That's my impression and not a slam on this film without viewing it longer."
B006DUK1K0 This movie was so odd and yet I couldn't stop watching it. If you're wondering if you'd like it just know that this film (IMO) was a cross of a History Channel docu-drama, late night poorly made soft core porn and Moulin Rouge (&lt;because of the interior design and cinematography). Here are my top 10 noteworthy observations from the movie:1. As you can probably figure out by the title, this film focuses firstly on the market and exploitation of women in France come the 1900s2. ^However, the director/ writer were both clever in really drawing your attention to the different women when they were all together and everything seemed harmless, and natural and beatiful in the state of undress. Pretty much any other time you see these women (90% topless, 10% fully nude) and with a man, (maybe just me, maybe for others), but I didn't find them appealing anymore. It's as though they morphed into puppeteered china dolls that felt so lifeless yet had such entertained facade around their \"guests\". (And yes, I understand anyone might put on a facade if you were being sold for sex every night).3. You are constantly reminded in this movie that despite the care-free somewhat lux lives these women are living, they are by no means free. Every day they rack up a debt that they will never be able to re-pay4. It is strange at times as you get mixed feelings from some of the women about sex/ relationships- some speak of their 'clients' in a rather light and humorous manner, some seem like they pride themselves in their \"specialties\", while others have grown to despise sex altogether.5. The interior design and lay out of the bordello is quite beautiful (although I'd hate to see it under a black light lol)6. For how much time is spent around the characters the ending is quite disappointing but neat that they filmed this \"bordello\" in present day with it's surroundings.7. The modern music was at times an odd touch, especially when many of the characters are slow dancing in period attire to the Moody Blues, although this has been accomplished in other movies seamlessly, here it achieved quite the opposite effect.8. Very interesting undertone with the main character, as you follow her from the beginning as just another ordinary prostitute through her horrible accident, her odd dream sequence and later the revival of someone/ something else in her.9. It was very interesting to watch their use and methods of sanitation, even though many ended up getting sick or dying anyway.10. Also noteworthy is the appaling goodbye letter written to one of the women stating that since coming from an aristocratic and healthy family and despite his deep love and unquestionable willingness to sacrifice himself for her, he must not see her anymore as she has an infectious terminal illness...really?? You're more concerned about catching an STD and spreading it to your high nose aristocrat family than the fact that you have no morals or self-respect to 1. tarnish your character by going to the local whore house and 2. be a coward and liar who obviously doesn't know what deep love or self-sacrifice isOverall, it was to say the least an interesting movie, that still managed to keep my interest despite it's slow moving plot and english subtitles. I would probably only recommend this to students with interests or classes in human rights, women's rights, exploration of human sexuality, or psychology, as this movie could make for great discussions and personal interpritations."
B006DUK1K0 A really boring soft-core porn film rather than a French art film.  As best I can tell there was no plot.  if you're looking for a god foreign film pass this one up!!"
B006DUK1K0 This movie was so much more than expected.  I thought it was a beautifully done movie on all counts. I thought the timing appropriate to the film and the unfolding of the story. If I was looking more for entertainment than thought provoking material this wouldn't have been my choice. The nudity was entirely used as costume, not excitement or for shock value.  It addressed the vulnerability of being female while focusing on a more specific slice of that vulnerability that is only different because of the specific exchange of coins. The era, the settings, the players make no difference in the experience or our social structure as it relates to women. The sheer sensitivity of all the people who put this together is amazing. It took great understanding to pull this off in this delicate way.  All that being said the title was completely unfortunate.  I would never have selected this movie and someone looking &#34;for a good time&#34;, will be disappointed.  The reviews should help but many go by a title.  It does not attract it's target audience. I will think about this movie while others will be frustrated. That will be what is reflected in comments."
B006DUK1K0 The movie was okay but it dragged in places.  The ending was a little disappointing and left the viewer hanging."
B006DUK1K0 It is best movie in long time.  I loves the history and always learn something that I haven't hear or learn in the past."
B006DUK6SM \"It's takes a village to raise a child.\"  Everyone could have made a difference before it was too late if they had chosen to do so.Movies Message:  We all have choices everyday in our own \"villages\"."
B006DUK6SM This movie surpassed my expectations for it!  Maudlin and stirring with deep regret and a heartfelt sadness that is not easily expressed.  Piven is a very good actor for a young talent.  Having sons, sons who drifted away through traumatic separations make it difficult to watch.  Losing someone is a living death though they are alive; still it is like a death when they are out of a person's life.  Divorce has made a Nation full of dislocated parents and children.  Asking why a thousand times a day doesn't make it any better or different!"
B006DUK6SM What happens when you leave a child unattended for a few minutes, only to find out that the child has ventured out of the truck, in the cold winter, and is found too late. With this premise, the movie is about the parents, both a little screwed up, and certainly not parents of the year. The father, who is responsible for the event, never quite makes it through, and one can tell ahead of time where this story is heading. Sad, a great reminder that children must be under supervision at all times, and more depressing than anything else. 3 Stars."
B006DUK6SM A very good story line. A young dad takes his son in his truck into the woods,in the dead of winter, sees something, locks his son in the truck, cautioning him not to move and goes to explore.  he comes back and his son is not in the truck and not a trace of him.The rest of the plot keeps you in two minds and the endings is quite a shock."
B006DUK6SM ANGELS CREST is not a perfect movie: there are so many undeveloped sidebars that keeping everyone in a place where they seem to fit into the tale is difficult.  But there are some powerful performances here and some cause for reflection that makes the movie very worthwhile watching. Based on the novel by the same name written by Leslie Schwartz, adapted for the screen by Catherine Trieschmann, and directed by Gaby Dellal, the story deals with numerous interactions of a small town populated with alcoholics, drug abusers, adulterers, and other strange types and how they deal with a tragedy that makes no sense.Nate Denton (Ameko Eks Mass Carroll) is a 3 year old son of Ethan Denton (Thomas Dekkar in a breakout performance that deserves attention) who awakens one morning in his pathetic home to tell his beloved single dad that it is snowing.  The father/son bond is strong and Ethan dresses them both to go out to view the beauty of the snowy countryside in their old truck.  When they arrive at a perfect spot, Ethan turns to the backseat to take Nate out to make snowmen, but Nate has fallen asleep in this safety car seat.  Ethan makes the truck warm, locks the truck and walks out to view the spectacle of winter, the deer, and the eloquent mountains.  In a few minutes he returns - and Nate is gone!  Ethan is terrified, begins shouting his son's name as he searches for him.  The town is alerted and a search party begins.  Nate's mother alcoholic mother Cindy (Lynn Collins) is notified of Nate's missing and begins her tirade on every person she meets.  After an overnight search for Nate, Ethan discovers Nate's frozen body and is devastated. Ethan is taken into custody for a death stemming from negligence and the townspeople form sides as to Ethan's guilt.  Among them is a waitress Angie (Mira Sorvino) and her small daughter Rosie (Emma Macgillivray), Ethan's friend Rusty (Joseph Morgan), a lesbian couple (Elizabeth McGovern and Kate Walsh), Cindy's preachy  mother (Barbara Williams). and the local police.  The town brings in the District Attorney (Jeremy Piven) who obviously has secrets of his won that mirror Ethan's crisis.  The story is resolved in a strange and tragic manner, leaving many crises unsolved.Thomas Dekkar gives such a fine performance that we are able to see inside his heart and head and soul.  The supporting cast conveys the small town response to a tragedy among their own - who is guilty of what and how could the incident have ever occurred.  There are many ideas created by the writers and the characters that are never realized fully, but the sense of human response to an accident is staggeringly real.  There is much more to this film in retrospect, after watching it, that haunts the viewer.  Grady Harp, December 11"
B006DUK6SM The plot is interesting, the characters are believable, technically great. I would like to see more of this program, and hope it makes the cut."
B006DUK6SM Ordinarily in a movie filled with grief, such as this one, there is some teaching moment - something that saves it from the pit of despair.  Now I realize that isn't life.  Life hands us grief - or, more times than not, we make our own.  I does not hand us an 'Ah Ha!' moment.  Many times movies try to do that - it doesn't here.  It leaves every individual to find their own reason based on the surface look of a mix of characters.  In other words - it's filmed grief of flawed individuals that unfortunately produced a child.  They are so absorbed by their own flaws that they really fail this child from the moment of conception.  Maybe that's the teaching moment.  It doesn't matter how much you love something or someone; if you don't pay real attention to anyone besides yourself - you will eventually call it guilt."
B006DUK6SM Heartbreakingly realistic performances by most of the actors along with an excellent script makes &#34;Angels Crest&#34; a must see drama.  It portrays the consequences of bad decisions in as brutal a fashion as I have ever seen in a movie.  The lead actor was outstanding if somewhat enigmatic. His heartbreak is as true to reality as I have seen any actor portray."
B006DUK6SM and scary reminder of how quickly little people become curiously efficient! well directed/acted relationships that, like real life, are dependent on the domestic occurrences...and the invisible command to mature or deal with consequences."
B006DUK6SM Just what we need.  Another deeply depressing downer about dealing with the death of a child.  This time we have Ethan (Thomas Dekker from TV's \"Terminator: The Sarah Conner Chronicles\"), a 20 something dad who has custody of his 3 year old son.  He is divorced from his alcoholic, skanky sleep-around wife (Lynn Collins).  The film is set in the fictitious Angels Crest, Montana (filmed in the Alberta Rockies), occupied by a small but close community of gorgeous people, at least all that are under 50.The town has a diner where everyone gathers and exchange gossip about each other.  The diner is run by Angie (Mira Sorvino), the sympathetic big sister type.  We know we are in for rough sledding early on when Ethan takes his 3 year old out into the wilderness to build a snowman.  The poor kid falls asleep and dad decides to leave him in the truck and track down some deer.  I mean, there is all kind of wildlife in this mountainous region, but you would think this guy had never seen a deer.  When Ethan returns to the truck 10 or 15 minutes later, the kid is gone.  Somehow he had managed to escape his car seat, roll down the window and escape.Well, there is no happy ending and it is hard to not feel for the poor schmuck as you would anyone.  No one in town feels anything but sympathy including the town lesbians played by Elizabeth McGovern as the former straight, married with-a-son one and Kate Walsh in all her butchiness.  Then there's Cindy's (Collins) mother the Evangelical and Jeremy Piven as the D.A. who is going to prosecute Ethan.  Jack (Piven) it seems has a past of his own.  Something about losing his only child, but we never learn the particulars.  Then there's the best friend of Ethan who has also been sleeping with Cindy.  Whew!  There's more but you get the idea.In a tragedy play like this, the director got too involved with the numerous characters.  In addition, some of the scenes are just ridiculous.  In one, Jack the prosecutor (Piven) shows up at a potential witness's house wearing one of those furry hats with the earflaps that tie...and it never comes off.  In another, Ethan decides to take Angie's three year old daughter for a ride in his truck without telling her.  This is after his son dies!  Are you kidding me?  Anyway, forget this film unless you want to go into a manipulated deep state of depression, albeit with some beautiful snowy Rocky Mountain vistas.  A much better, but similar themed movie of this nature is Atom Egoyan's \"The Sweet Hereafter\" (1997)."
B006DUK6SM I rented this because Mira Sorvino was in it and the last two movies we've watched with her in it were so well-acted that now I check out any new movies that she's in.  She had a small role in this movie, but she was good in the role.What I liked about this movie was how real it felt, the acting was so good that you could actually believe they were father and son and you get lost in it that way.  The little boy steals your heart. What I didn't like was how underdeveloped the other characters were, how several side stories were introduced but went nowhere and the extremely abrupt ending.I don't regret renting it and I thought it was pretty good, but also frustrating in that it felt incomplete."
B006DUK6SM My wife and I found this movie to be quite boring.  The acting was OK, but the author left something to be desired."
B006DUK6SM None of the movie was a surprise but a simple depiction of tragedy. The film simply set up the scene, the basics of character, a tragic event to propel the movie There were tons of subplots hinted at and it could easily have gone off course, but it didn't.  I thought it was interesting that the film maker made the choice to remind us that everyone has their own baggage in any situation, but that doesn't  change the main focus. It really made me think about how quickly the most innocent choice could go wrong so quickly.  A bad choice could  turn even quicker and children are so quick after they learn to walk!  the town sentiments were complex and mixed in with their own personal issues, but it seemed to be a divide between those that had children and those that didn't, but there is plenty of room for differing opinions. Lovely seamless acting by everyone."
B006FKSSOY While I may find the care bears just a tad annoying my daughter loves this show. What am I to do?"
B006FKSSOY He's almost 3 years old and he loves the voices and colors in the Care Bears.  I'm not so sure he follows all the stories, but he has a great time laughing and watching it."
B006FKSSOY It's Care Bears! My kids love them and it has several episodes so your not sorting through Dvd's looking for other episodes"
B006FKSSOY This is a great show for babysitting. It keeps the young children entertained while teaching values. I recommend it to everyone."
B006FKSSOY Care Bears is a very colorful show that has a lesson for the kids to learn. My grandson really likes for me to play them on my kindle for him."
B006FKSSOY My daughter loves the care bears and these cartoons are very cute.  Nothing scarey him them and the animation is way better than the ones I grew up with."
B006FKSSOY Care bears are always uplifting, never any foul language and it shows my little ones ways to make choices.  I also like the use of color to enhance each character."
B006FKSSOY This is not the care a lot I grew up with but they are still very cute and the message is always positive. This is a great show to let your kids watch."
B006FKSSOY My 3 yo adores this updated classic. Theme song is required singing :). A classic that still teaches valuable lessons. Great pic too"
B006FKSSOY The show is great.  But my granddaughter ordered this automatically without my permission.  I have since learned how to block ordering.  All she had to do was press watch this now - and I payed  She just pressed buttons and watched these shows all day long.  The shows kept her occupied and she wantedmore and more"
B006FTBWXY Nice to watch Family and also you learn from it. A four some language not appropriate.. improve for kids to watch they are our future..."
B006FTBWXY The show is still pretty cool. Like learning about all the stuff that comes into the shop. Clean for the family."
B006FTBWXY Great show, the old man and Chumley are hillarious. I like the crew and I have learned a lot about what to look for at yard sales and thrift stores."
B006FTBWXY Unlike the ever predictable theme of every Rocky movie that came out these guys are doing the same thing all the time but have fresh stuff to show you at each show."
B006FTBWXY Love this show. I enjoy all the history you learn about a object and not to mention how much some stuff goes for."
B006FTBWXY I love this show.  Not only do you learn amazing history of the objects that come in, but the enthusiasm of Rick for his purchases is fun to see.  And the interaction between family members and staff can be hilarious. To be able to watch this show on my new ipad is absolutely wonderful."
B006FTBWXY I always learn a lot about things that people bring in to sell.  There is a lot of history behind some of the items.  Always fun to watch."
B006FTBWXY It is fun to see all of the different,and interesting, things that come into the store. It must be a very large business operation as most pawn shops that i have visited were filled with a variety of pretty common stuff.Pops, the boys, and  Chumley are the real fun entertainment of the show."
B006FTBWXY I love the historical aspects of this show.  It is outrageously fun.  All of the personalities seem to work well together."
B006FTBWXY I have the HDX 8.9&#34; and really love this show.  Being a Prime member, I especially enjoy getting certain seasons for free.  Anyway, content wise the show is wonderful.  It's always entertaining because you never know what someone is bringing in.  Picturewise, the picture is excellent in HD.  This is just a great investment in your entertainment."
B006FTBWXY the store receives some pawns that are old, artistic, motorhead, canons, vintage guns and much ..much more..it's nice to see some comedic interactions with store workers also.."
B006FTBWXY Love the family and chumley too. Rick loves History and me as we ll. I hope to some day go in shop and buy something that I don t need, that somebody else didn t need and then pass it down to somebody that doesn t need it either"
B006FTBWXY I have been watching this show long enough to know that Chumlee is a good shot. He should compete in tournaments."
B006FTBWXY well: this is a 2 Disc set beginning with Darth Pawn & ending with Take a Seat which is from 2011 & NO NEW DVDS yet! Now they cut & edit their own programs to sneak in additional ads. But I digress. If you LOVE the guys, you WILL Luv the episodes but we are willing to get more dvds & everything stopped. There are other Pawns but they're basically Reissues or as they call them &#34;Fan Favorites&#34;. I've written A&E & HISTORY to no avail & no answers. Lousy marketing in our opinions. We can't afford the Instant Seasons that are available either."
B006FTBWXY If you follow this show you know that over the seasons they have started to focus on &#34;storylines&#34; about each member of the show (Rick, Cory, The Old Man and Chumley). I don't watch the show for this stupidity, I enjoy seeing the items that come in, learning about them and what they are worth.  I really wish they would focus on that more and less on these silly stories that no one cares about."
B006FTBWXY Love the Pawn Stars guys and this is another great season.  Hope to see season 6 and 7 next on Prime.  I like to learn about things and watch this guys, they always make me smile."
B006FTBWXY When this show originated, I never expected it to last.  As it progressed, I became hooked on trying to evaluate the various items brought in.As the show progressed, my opinion of the blue-collar, poor grammar guys in the shop really upsurged.  They really know their history and business.  From fine art to antique artifacts, these guys are truly knowledgeable way beyond the poor knowledge demonstrated of their native language.The show is compelling, kind of like a poor man's PBS Antique's Road Show."
B006FTBWXY We love this series.  Informative and funny. Love the interaction between the generations who work together. Chumlee is a hoot!"
B006FTBWXY Love this season as I do all of their seasons. Chum lee and the guys are as always great. Love the new shop"
B006FTBWXY My family and I love this show and the staff.  We mainly watch it because of the history we learn about the artifacts."
B006FTBWXY The show features a trio of men who seem to really enjoy how they make a living by buying and selling some very unusual items. Once in awhile someone will show up with a rare, almost priceless item that they want to sell. That's where the fun begins. Is it real or is it fake?  This keeps the interest high, making the show well worth watching."
B006FTBWXY In every episode you learn bits of history behind the items brought into the pawn shop, all while being entertained.  And who knows, maybe you have a valuable treasure sitting in the closet. :)"
B006FTBWXY Quick Take: Essentially, this is half a season for half the price. A non-sale, non-discounted price of 19.95 fits in line with almost six hours worth of DVD content. A full season, had it been released that way, would simply have doubled the asking price.Last year, History and A&E; Television made the dubious decision to start releasing Volumes of their most popular shows as opposed to Seasons. I was one of the most vocal opponents of this move and some of my scathing tirades can be found on those initial releases. In truth, though, I have nothing against the idea of volume releases (especially for shows that aren't held together by continuing plot threads) as long as three things are clear:1) They need to be priced according to content and no more expensive individually than a season set would be.2) Don't start releasing Full Seasons and then switch tactics mid-stream to confuse unsuspecting buyers.3) If it isn't a season, all content needs to be disclosed on the DVD packaging so the consumer knows what they are getting!Last year, many of these early Volume releases broke my second and third rule. I mean really! How can you release a DVD when it's not a full season and NOT tell buyers how many and which episodes are included? Absolutely unforgivable. I need that information to decide whether or not I want to purchase the set. As we have progressed, though, and the notion that we're to continue with Volume releasing has stayed with us, the point becomes rather more muddy. Now, we're past the second issue and the third issue has been corrected. All of these Volume releases now contain information about the content. So, there is no deception and no confusion. You get \"x\" number of episodes for \"x\" price. It's now up to you whether or not it's worth it. That's fair. If you don't like it, don't buy it.Volume Five of \"Pawn Stars\" contains sixteen episodes over two discs for just shy of six hours worth of content, coming from most of Season Four.  If you have collected the earlier entries in the Pawn Stars DVD releases, this is the next group of chronological episodes.  There are no Special features, but English and Spanish subtitles are optional. Included:(1) Darth Pawn, (2) Put Up Your Dukes, (3) Pawn Illustrated, (4) Striking A Chord, (5) Harrison For President, (6) Wise Guys, (7) Robosaurus, (8) Ah, Shoot!, (9) Going Postal, (10) Chummobile, (11) Evel Genius, (12) Pablo Pawncasso, (13) Sub For Sale, (14) Missile Attack, (15) Not On My Watch, and (16) Take A Seat.The show is entertaining for several reasons. Of course, some intriguing merchandise passes through their hands and you just might learn something. But as in any reality show, this one is as much about interaction and conversation as it is about the art of the deal. The Harrison guys are a colorful crew--real old school Vegas. Perhaps the biggest scene stealer is Chumlee (like an adopted son) who plays village idiot, but can surprise you as well. It's comical and engaging for the most part. All in all, it is rather like the unsavory and confrontational cousin to the classic \"Antiques Roadshow\" with more grit and edge. KGHarris, 8/12,"
B006FTBWXY Please read my review of Volume 6.Not too much has changed.I reviewed #6 before #5 so the review process is backwards.This is an unusual series.Much like &#34;Antique Road Show&#34;but in a pawn shop."
B006FTBWXY Every show has interesting things that come into the Pawn Shop.  However, I am extremely tired of the jousting, barbs and insults form the Old Man (especially), and that Rick never has a good job or good word for Cory or Chum.  I've stopped watching almost.  I don't watch nearly as much as I did in the past."
B006FTBWXY Here is a vidio set that is so neat to think history is still in the hands of folks that don't always know what they have.  Fun and a great way to discover things about history you may have never known."
B006FTBWXY I love the Pawn Stars series, particularly because we can't watch it on television so being able to rent it from Amazon is a plus. What's not to like with 4-5 fat guys showing off their knowledge of historic object (and some not so historic). Satisfies an inner need for greed."
B006FTBWXY chumlee is the star of the show. rick is the brains. their antic are almost as good as I love lucy. Plus you get and education as well."
B006FTBWXY The is a very fun show. You just can't watch one. Great entertainment plus you always learn something as well."
B006FTBWXY Big Hoss is stepping it up to try and assert his place as a co-owner of the Pawn Shop.  Very interesting dynamics in a great setting with lots of interesting characters and items coming thru the doors."
B006FTBWXY A lot of set-ups, but that's OK. Takes all kinds to make the world go around. Like to see it in person."
B006FTBWXY We love Pawn Stars and appreciate being able to stream it but...Amazon's responsiveness has been horrid!!! They must improve on the responsiveness of the equipment serving up these videos. I essentially gave up after viewing just one episode (which we loved).The problem isn't once the streaming starts, but it is getting the system to the point where an episode can be selected and then started. I'm using a Roku3 box."
B006FTBWXY Addictive show and a huge hit now. You really learn interesting tidbits about old merchandise and historic pieces. And with money involved, it keeps you watching. I will say the current seasons are coming up with more nonsense with the crew. Very pre-scripted stuff. Many items brought in lately are guns and books. I prefer movie props myself."
B006FTBWXY Love the people, history lessons and fun they have.  Three generation shows a deep love as well as real conflict. We often wonder who and where are the women in their life."
B006FTBWXY I enjoy this show very much.  It is interesting to watch the various items that come in for sale and the negotiations that take place between the seller and the pawn shop owners.  Some sellers over value their product while some under value their product and the pawn shop owners have to sort it out while trying to make a profit.  It is all very entertaining."
B006FTBWXY Very entertaining.  I think Chumlee is really cool.  The old man is hysterical.  They're all good.  Keep them coming. Voila!"
B006FTBWXY Very entertaining, and enlightenment of what articles are really worth. I'd recommend this program to anyone who has old memorabilia lying around to watch this program."
B006FTBWXY My whole family likes this show.  We love the different historical finds.  We like to know what an object is worth and what you can get monetarily from one.  The family chemistry is fun to watch.  We have recommended this show to our friends and family."
B006FTBWXY The people on &#34;reality&#34; tv are fake and they encourage our youth to laziness and an inability to use their intelligence for anything but staring dumbly at the television."
B006FTBWXY Viva Las Vegas! Where else would you find characters like this. Entertaining and educational with a bit of real life drama."
B006FTBWXY I really enjoy seeing trinkets and treasures coming out and the value put on them.  But I cannot stand the pompous attitude that pervades the show through the slob characters.  It's so bad that I just turn the program off midway.  I'll take American Pickers and the storage war people over the Pawn Stars any day any time."
B006FTBWXY I love pawn stars, so of course I like volume 5. If u like the earlier seasons then you'll like this one. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes reality tv."
B006FTBWXY We love watching this show. You learns something new about antiques and see what people have collected in their attics or cellars ~ that are worth some money! Makes you wish you'd kept some of those old items you tossed years ago :)"
B006FTBWXY Fun to see what kind of things make it into a Pawn Store. The items are interesting as well as the people that bring in the items.The family dynamics are also entertaining"
B006FTBWXY If this show would stop interrupting itself with SCRIPTED NONSENSE, it would be nearly perfect for what it is.  Interesting transactions and conversations of historical relevance with customers and experts are the highlights of this show.  Here we have people who are genuinely interesting WITHOUT SCRIPTED SCENES, participating in fake pranks and telling poorly-timed jokes.  It just stinks of audience manipulation and poor writing.  Neither of which belong in a &#34;REALITY&#34; TV show.I blame the show runners.  They need to be fired.  Let's just follow the &#34;Pawn Stars&#34; on their terms and hear from them and let reality HAPPEN instead of manipulating it.  I think these guys are interesting people.  Let THEM run the show.  Let THEM decide how to film.If the fake crap does not stop, I am not going to view this anymore--and I suggest you avoid it too.  Why participate in time-wasting TV tactics?  I tune in to observe experts and pawn professionals do their thing.  This is not supposed to be the next &#34;Three's Company.&#34;Otherwise, the show is great because Chumlee, The Old Man, Rick, and Corey are good, unique, and often funny people.  When not scripted, of course."
B006FYDKMA The best pickers in the Biz, been watching these guys since they started the show and love every episode.  Well produced with great audio and video quality."
B006FYDKMA THIS show is fun to watch for the entire family,teaches our our younger generations how things used to be,when the guys find old hidden treasures from the past..these &#34;pickers&#34; are not afraid to get their hands dirty,sometime s climbing through piles of storages things,to find a &#34;honey hole&#34;of special items from America's past.They travel America's back roads,again teaching us all what great country we live in."
B006FYDKMA Great way to pick up on some history and american culture.  This show will make you a better negotiator at yard sales."
B006FYDKMA This was a great episode, but I may be biased because I think all of their episodes are great. And as a collector myself I always learn something new from these guys."
B006FYDKMA After all these years this show still amuses me in what they do. Every time I watch it I actually learn something. Its still as good as it was when it first started."
B006FYDKMA I've watched seasons 1 - 4 so far and enjoyed them all.  Mike and Frank set up a friendly bantering when they are on the road.  It is fascinating to see the &#34;rusty gold&#34; that they find in some people's piles of junk."
B006FYDKMA How absolutely cool it is to see inside the daily lives and jobs of three very cool people !and the treasures they find are more often the people they meet than the stuff they collect."
B006FYDKMA Mike and Frank seem like guys I could hang out with, I enjoy the dynamic of the two of them driving around in the van and the interactions they have with the people they pick. I also love the stories that go along with the treasures that they find. It didn't hurt that I only paid $9.99 for the entire season, Mike, that's what we call &#34;breaking the ice&#34;."
B006FYDKMA I almost feel like I am picking with them or at one of their stores. I enjoy learning about the pickers and their customers. It is fun to be told what an item was originally used for."
B006FYDKMA Seems like a good series and the characters are interesting."
B006FYDKMA Its refreshing to see nice guys doing well in business -- treating others fairly, not trying to swindle, cheat, beat or climb over others as a way of doing business. They make it pleasurable for all! Very enjoyable show."
B006FYDKMA Many years spent riding with my dad doing just the same thing, meeting folks and picking!  Can't beat it.  You meet some crazy, funny and interesting people who widen your horizons and expand your knowledge and just plain have fun!  I can even almost guess the prices they will pay and what they will sell it for.  It is great to see them treat people fairly and just enjoy themselves.  Good fun!"
B006FYDKMA My wife and I can't get enough of this show.  Mike and Frank (and Dani) are entertaining, the stuff they find is amazing, and the information they supply on history of the objects is usually quite interesting"
B006FYDKMA This is a great consept for a show. I watch every episode i can. I like the way the guys treat everyone they meet."
B006FYDKMA Two childhood friends travel across America searching for the old and the unusual.  They take these items out of hiding and sell them in their store to other people who appreciate the history behind them.  Their enthusiasm for the history behind the items and their excitement in finding them is infectious."
B006FYDKMA I'm not a reality TV? Fan but I do enjoy this show, the guys are fun and funny. As is the gal in the store. A key part of the team. Finding and sending the guys to a good picking site. All in all, a fun entertaining and even educational, whenThey find an object, and can give us it's history,You won't be disappointed, if you watch this, show, and all the characters, they run into."
B006FYDKMA These two give a glimpse of how things were in the &#34;good old days.&#34; Mike and Frank are always on the lookout for things that bring back the past in rural America. They have lots of fun looking, and we have fun watching them look."
B006FYDKMA I think it's boring but the Mr. likes it.  Not much changes from episode to episode.  It must be a guy thing."
B006FYDKMA Explanation For Lower Rating:I'm not sure what the History Channel is doing with their DVD releases this year, but it is certainly a step in the wrong direction. When they released \"Pawn Stars: Volume Three,\" many people assumed that the show would be Season Three as the other two seasons of the program had been released in their entirety. It was, in fact, only sixteen episodes. When they released \"American Pickers: Volume Two,\" it was the same thing. Season One had been released with all episodes, but this Volume Two was only eight episodes of Season Two. I know some people that preordered sight unseen, or just weren't paying attention, felt a little shortchanged by these smaller portions as opposed to what they had assumed were full season DVD releases. Personally, I didn't agree with the decision but, at least, the DVD packaging was very clear about what was included. Anyone who read the box knew what to expect: how many episodes and which ones, so it wasn't a blind investment!Now here's a leap backwards for \"American Pickers,Volume 4.\"I am sitting here with the DVD in hand and nowhere does it say how many episodes are inside. Never mind that it doesn't list them (which in my opinion it should if it is not a Complete Season package), it doesn't even tell you how many episodes you are getting. I suppose I'm supposed to look at the running time and do some estimated mathematics? I know this may seem trivial to some or that I'm overreacting, but I think the company owes potential buyers this information. My lower rating, therefore, reflects the History Channel's (or A&E; Networks distributing) apparent disregard for its own fan base. I don't like to make purchases without knowing exactly what I'm paying for!  It's not the price (which is in line with the contents), it's the lack of information that bothers me.I, however, will tell you what is inside. The 2 DVD set has eight episodes, a chronological continuation of Season Two for just shy of six hours worth of programming.  Really, how hard would it have been to include the fact that there were eight episodes on the DVD box?Season Two: (1) Fairlane Fever, (2) Too Hot To Handle, (3) Trading Up, (4) The Emu Chase, (5) Keep Out!, (6) They Boldly Go, (7) The Possum Trot, and (8) California Dreamin.  There are no special features, but there are Spanish and English subtitle options.The premise, for anyone unfamiliar with the show, is that two \"pickers\" (Mike Wolfe and Frank Fritz) travel the country trying to unearth hidden treasures from the various people they meet along the way. Some of the items may have historical significance.  That's the angle the History Channel uses to tie the show into its lineup. In truth, the show has similar appeal to the classic \"Antique Roadshow\" mixed with the treasure hunting gamble of \"Storage Wars\" with a dash of \"Hoarders\" thrown in for good measure. It's always intriguing to see what long forgotten gems might be lurking in someone's garage or junkyard. Along the way, the boys chat up the locals and experience a different kind of Americana.  An interesting show, but fans deserve some respect in these DVD releases.  KGHarris, 8/12."
B006FYDKMA Mike and Frank have great personalities and in-depth knowledge of antique junk! It's a junk history lesson on things I have thrown away. It's easy to get hooked on these episodes."
B006FYDKMA My husband and I enjoy American Pickers. This show captures audiences both old and young. Very diverse and entertaining. Funny!"
B006FYDKMA Ride again!You just can't go wrong with these guys, (and gals...).  Okay, I take issue with some of his motorcycle &#34;expertise&#34;, (having ridden and worked on / for the Big Twin for most of my life), but it's STILL one of the original and best series of it's kind available today."
B006FYDKMA The chase is on to a reality show that is fun and amazing in the search of America's lost treasures.  You will love it and a must for trivia and seakers of the past ."
B006FYDKMA I love American Pickers I have watched almost every episode at least once some several times. Started watching it the first season and would record it on the DVR.  Since we have had Amazon Prime we have watched all of those shows and the newer ones too. Appreciate not having to lose them after a year or so.  They are fun to review."
B006FYDKMA Amazing show with both history and entertainment. The stuff they run into keeps you wondering what they will find next. Mike and Frank are great together and make the show flow."
B006FYDKMA I just get a kick out of watching these guy come up with treasures out of junk heaps.  They seem to have a knack for finding some real unusual characters along the way too.  I recommend this show to anyone."
B006FYDKMA Great show!! Looking forward to more episodes! Love what they find, they have given me idea's on how to re use old items."
B006FYDKMA Am always entertained at their ability to talk prices down, But am always educated as to history of antiques and the such. Love their chemistry and the occasional danielle pick."
B006FYDKMA GREAT SHOW!!! MY BROTHER TOLD ME ABOUT THIS SHOW& I LOVE IT.... SO WHEN I SAW IT OFFERED AMAZON &#34;PRIME&#34; (FREE) I SNAPED IT UP!!!!"
B006FYDKMA Yay...love these guys and the people that they find. Always a good time filler!"
B006FYDKMA Mike and Frank have the best jobs in the world! I wish I could do what they do. They inspire me to do some picking."
B006FYDKMA I learn so much from watching these guys. Great show. Never gets old. Always something different. Frank and Mike are great together."
B006FYDKMA History, stories and junk combined and delivered by two real characters. An educational, human interest tour-de-force. I can't wait for the next season to go Prime."
B006FYDKMA I really enjoy seeing the Pickers find some great stuff.  I bring back memorials and also gives you some history."
B006FYDKMA Awesome Show for anyone who likes old stuff. Funny and educational with engaging characters. Have seen stuff on this show I've never seen before!"
B006FYDKMA Never get tired of seeing what they will find next on their trail for the next great collectible.  Their searches for stuff is fun to watch...almost like an antique scavenger hunt!  As a collector myself with over 500 advertising signs and other collectibles, I can appreciate their enthusiasm for the &#34;hunt&#34; ... just don't come to my house looking for stuff!"
B006GM4JNU This might be the only Disney show that's actually worth watching.  It is very entertaining and has a nice range of characters."
B006GM4JNU &#34;Whatcha doing?&#34; Watching Phineas and Ferb, probably. :-) It's nice to have the episodes available on demand and not have to scour the TV listings to see when it is on. Each episode is great and there are many layers to explore for everyone, kids and adults."
B006GM4JNU My 6 year old son loves Phineas and Ferb and he is so excited to be able to watch them again as we haven't had cable in a while. The episodes play nice and smooth over our Roku box."
B006GM4JNU This is a great show for kids. It is one that does not need to be reviewed. Your kids can just watch it."
B006GM4JNU I like the show, but Candace gets on my nerves. She is such a drama queen and yells waayyyy to much. I think Phineas and Ferb are really cool, creative and smart though. The villian and Perry is also a cool part of the show. The villian is almost likeable. Which is good. He's just a bit misguided."
B006GM4JNU I will cheerfully admit to being a childless adult that enjoys this show. Kids can't appreciate so much of what makes this show funny. The songs are great and so are the characters. I cannot recommend this show enough. It is truly creative and deserving of your time."
B006GM4K2A This is by far my favorite Disney show.  I think it is very imaginative and smart.  My wife and I like it just as much as the kids do."
B006GM4K2A If you like the show you'll love this Phineas and Ferb season. It's fun for the whole family... even grandma!"
B006GM4K2A Mom loves the show for the pure genius that is Phineas and Ferb and their inventions. Son (who is an adult, but started watching the show when he was in the &#34;proper&#34; demographic), loves the antics and is seeing the layers of the show now. In fact, at work, one of the teams that Mom is on had a &#34;homework&#34; assignment where someone who had never seen the show (only one out of the 6 team members) had to report on what &#34;OWCA&#34; stood for. This is a show that adults can enjoy while the kids are watching, too."
B006GM4K2A My 6 year old son loves Phineas and Ferb and he is so excited to be able to watch them again as we haven't had cable in a while. The episodes play great over our Roku box."
B006GM4K2A The show has broad appeal to girls and boys; various ages and interest. I like the shows Imagination and modern approach to story telling."
B006GM4K2A My six year old loves it as does my husband. The only thing that gets on my nerves is Candane is an annoying drama queen. And the mushy love stuff between Candace and Jeremy and Isabella and Phineas is a bit too adult for kids. The evil villian is not scary at all. Perry and the evil guy are funny,but there is some physical violence between them. It's short lived but still short lived. Take a look and see what you think before you let the kids watch. It is meant for older kids age 7 and up."
B006GM4K2A I am a childless adult who was introduced to the show by a friend. It is genuinely funny and most episodes are memorable. The songs are great and the characters are strong. Kids can't really appreciate why it is so funny. Highly recommended."
B006H0602Y When I was 21, I worked in a convenience store.  No, I know what you're thinking, but that wasn't the impressive part.  While I was working there, one night a guy came in and asked me if I wanted to manage a rock band.  How could I say, \"No\"?OK; so I wasn't going to manage that band per se.  I was going to be a roadie.  Whatever.  But just like the lead in this film -- Ron Eldard, who plays his part perfectly with a bittersweet edge -- I sucked it up and I setup and I tore down equipment nightly, for the betterment of the band.  And Rock And Roll.I should have seen the writing on the wall when, one night, most of the guitarist's equipment was stolen from the back of The Van.  (And no, I wasn't at fault on that one.  I don't even think that I was important enough to have keys to The Van.)  But it gets worse.  Since I played guitar at the time, he asked me if he could use my equipment that night.  I said, \"Sure!\" which was really stupid, but it didn't work out as poorly as it could have.  At least neither my Wa-Wa nor Chorus pedal were stolen that night.But my final paycheck from the band bounced, which was surely a bummer, and that's how it became \"final.\"  I worked really hard for that money; surely harder than the band ever did.  I knew that they probably weren't going anywhere, based upon the fact that they were a local band, and based upon the fact that they mostly played Frat parties, and further based upon the fact that they weren't as well known as Blue Oyster Cult (BOC).Now, if you were a metalhead from that era, you surely had the opinion that BOC was borderline lame.  You had Ozzy Ozbourne, who had the great Randy Rhoads on guitar.  (Check out the scene where our protagonist is going back into his bedroom for the first time in many years.  An iconic picture of Mr. Rhoads playing his iconic flying-V is hanging on the wall.  Now there was a guitarist!  Unlike that hack guitarist from BOC, whoever he was.)  And you had bands such as Judas Priest and The Scorpions, who could go all cow-bell all over BOC.  Even on the worst of nights.I did find it interesting that the writer and director chose to go with BOC as the band-that-never-appears here.  Whatever.  That was fine.  Maybe they just paid a small royalty to use the name?  (And surely that royalty was small.)  Perhaps they wanted to use a lame band since our protagonist could be called -- and I apologize -- somewhat lame, even though he is very sympathetic.  But the band itself doesn't matter, as I give nothing away as I say that the movie begins with the protagonist being fired, via phone call, from the band that he \"manages,\" err, \"roadies\" for.There are quite a few themes going on here, but one of them surely is \"looking back, nothing was ever as good as it seemed.\"  Just by looking in his eyes, you can tell that the protagonist realizes all that he's missed out on in life by pursuing his dreams, dreams that surely never materialized.  But his \"friends\" -- they were more like \"frenemies\" -- regret their lives as well, as they believe that maybe he lived a better life than they ever did.  Well, they're both wrong of course, as all of their lives were perhaps just ordinary.Not to give anything else away, but maybe instead of trying to be a rock star, one should simply be happy with the simple things in life, such as being a gardener?  That might be the real moral of the story as the credits roll.  And perhaps, \"I need more cowbell -- AND more films like 'Roadie.'\"  A pretty big recommendation on a film that brought back many memories, at least for me."
B006H0602Y ------------------------------------------------\"Roadie\"(Magnolia Home Entertainment, 2012)------------------------------------------------Ron Eldard shines as the lead in this indie film, playing Jimmy Testagros, a working-class lug from Queens, NY who is brought down to earth after having spent twenty-six years as a roadie for his all-time favorite rock band, and then getting fired and having to confront the emptiness of a life spent on the move. Down on his luck, he heads back to his hometown and the cold comfort of his rock-poster filled room in his widowed mother's house. Bobby Cannavale plays his dramatic foil, a former high school bully whose grown up into a jerky, loudmouthed adult who lures Jimmy back into the same humiliating, imbalanced power dynamic that divided them as teens. Cannavale's character generates heat in the script but is a little overstated -- his jerkiness is explained by his being a cokehead, but it's still a bit much. A more subtle performance comes from veteran character actor Lois Smith, who plays Jimmy's half-senile mother, and whose subtle reactions and keen appraisal of her son's failings gives the film real kick.  Eldard's Jimmy -- mopey, charming, transparent and forlorn -- is a compelling character, likable though pathetic, a guy who's bottoming out yet remains charismatic and attractive despite his all-too apparent failings. This is a movie about accepting people with all their flaws, which is a message I appreciate -- it might be a little too depressing or one-note for many viewers, but it's definitely worth checking out. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)"
B006H0602Y By Jim Clark, publisher Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MSJimmy Testagross (Ron Eldard) has been living his dream for over 20 years. He has been a roadie for Blue Oyster Cult. The key words are \"has been.\" Blue Oyster Cult has quit filling large arenas and have cut back on equipment and personnel. Jimmy is a victim of that downsizing.Since Jimmy doesn't have any other skill sets he limps back home to his mother.He hasn't seen her or talked to her since his father died. She is developing Dementia. The band continues to tour in South America but Jimmy's repeated calls go unanswered.After seeing what has happened to his mom he makes up a more successful Jimmy. He says he's become the band's manager, even produced and written some songs for them and is simply visiting before he must get on the road again because, \"they are lost without him.\"Downtrodden he walks into town to get a drink. There he becomes reacquainted with his longtime nemesis Randy Stevens (Bobby Cannavale) who has inherited his dad's car lot and married the girl, Nikki (Jill Hennessy) who Jimmy uses to pine for. I should say still pines for.The problem is Jimmy never grew up. He still harbours the regrets and frustrations that he's carried with him. The road was the only thing that gave him a feeling of normal ... his only true home. Now he's forced to make a life changing decision - either step up, tell the truth and take on the responsibility of his ailing mother or continue to live a lie.This is a neat little drama filled with great music."
B006H0602Y Ron Eldard and the rest of the cast have a great movie here. So typical and excellent script. All the characterizations are dead-on."
B006H0602Y This movie is amazing. Let me share, perhaps against your will, some personal data. I am 53, going back to my hometown I left 30 years ago. I have a life time of experiences spent apart from my old friends and enemies. I will see some of my old friends and daughter from times long gone during this trip. The feelings I am having, and the imagining of what may come are so close to what this movie conveys. Going back, after so long, to see what has been and perhaps your life under different experiences. This movie seems so real that it feels like I could have experienced it. Don't miss this one."
B006H0602Y Blue Oyster Cult was/is a Long Island rock band that peaked in the mid-70's with the classic \"(Don't Fear) The Reaper.\" In this indi-drama, Ron Eldard (\"Super 8\") plays Jimmy, a roadie on their tour for the past 20 some years.  For reasons unexplained, he is fired, by telephone no less.  With no job, no money and no prospects he decides to go to the house where he grew up in Queens, N. Y.  His mother (veteran actress Lois Smith), hardly recognizes him.  Except for one day when his father died, Jimmy hadn't been back since he first left home and went on tour.While sipping a cocktail at a local saloon, Jimmy runs into an old high school nemisis (Bobby Cannavale) and his wife and Jimmy's former girlfriend (Jill Hennessy).  Nikki (Hennessy) is a struggling solo artist, but seems happy in her life which includes singing before 30 or 40 people.  We can pretty much see where this is all heading but, it really doesn't.  Although Nikki does stop by Jimmy's house and visits his old bedroom which his mother had kept intact (complete with vinyl albums and a working turntable), their high school memories are just that.There really isn't much of a story here.  The actors do their part well, but they don't have much to work with.  Although a night out with plenty of booze and cocaine produces an opportunity to let loose, the story peters out the next day.  In addition to some fine performances, the soundtrack should satisfy most from this rock and roll generation.The Blu ray transfer is in 1080p with a 1.78:1 aspect ratio.  The picture is fine if unspectacular.  A bit soft here and there but nothing problematic.  The DTS-HD MA 5.1 soundtrack is solid especially with the dialog.  I guess I was expecting a bit more with the musical influences.  Again, not necessarily of concern."
B006H0602Y I was at about 3-1/2 stars on this one.  It was a cool movie.  Kinda reminds me of going home, and seeing people you haven't seen in years."
B006H0602Y Somewhat slow-moving and depressing, but great acting and feels 'real'. Makes you think about what could have been, and the lead character's life is sad, but realistic. A good renter."
B006H0602Y Thoughtful and well-written.Thought provoking.  Opportunities, choices, consequences. It's strange to think that the decisions  made before age 25, when we are all impaired with an undeveloped brain, directs the course of our adult  lives. It's frightening to realize that our  immature self with no life experience or health insurance, focused on wine, women & song,  is choosing our life path .  No wonder we wake up at 40, 50, or 60 dissatisfied and paniced.  The dream we followed was that of a child, using the experience, knowledge, and education of a child to dictate our lives in retirement. How does that make sense? How does the 15 year old self, dreaming of being a Rock star,  playing air guitar to the radio  in his parents  home rent free, occasionally hitting them up for gas/grass money , possibly know  enough or have enough skills to make life decisions?  Thank goodness  for social security  and Medicare!"
B006H0602Y Roadie (2011) tells the story of a man who returns to his hometown, after being unceremoniously fired from his job of twenty plus years, as a roadie for the rock band Blue Oyster Cult (BOC).  It's a poignant look at the past and the present, as pride prevents the rocker from telling the truth about his situation, to his mother, and those he grew up with.  While the characters might seem a bit clich&eacute;d and stereotyped, when put together they complement each other, and seem to belong to the same universe.  Familiarity with the music featured in the film is not essential, but adds greatly to its impact.Jimmy Testagross (Ron Eldard) arrives at his childhood home in Forrest Hills, New York, and instead of telling his mother (Lois Smith) that he has been fired, he claims to be the manager for Blue Oyster Cult, and is visiting before the band leaves on a tour of South America.  Jimmy repeatedly calls and leaves messages for someone named \"Bobby\", in connection with his situation, but never receives a return call.In a bar, Jimmy runs into Randy Stevens (Bobby Cannavale), a guy that tormented him in high school, who dredges up unpleasant memories, when he uses the nickname \"Jimmy Testicles\".  Randy now owns a car dealership, and his wife Nikki (Jill Hennessy), was once Jimmy's girlfriend.  Nikki sings and plays guitar, and is at the bar warming up for a performance that night.  Continuing the lie, the couple are suitably impressed by Jimmy's \"success\", as manager and contributing songwriter for BOC.With posters of Phil Lynott and Randy Rhodes on the wall, Jimmy and Nikki listen to the music of the Good Rats, as they reminisce in his bedroom, which has been preserved like a shine by Jimmy's mom.  Later Jimmy is picked up by Randy, and is taken to a motel, where Nikki is getting ready for her show.  Fueled by music, alcohol, and cocaine, what starts out as a fun time headbanging to BOC's \"See You In Black\", later turns ugly, as old demons resurface, and feelings are hurt.Directed and co-written by Michael Cuesta (Homeland, Dexter), Roadie is a \"little\" movie that may not fully resonate with those who don't have the life experiences to appreciate some of its nuances, but most can relate to some of the basic themes being examined.  Jimmy's embarrassment is completely understandable, and his deception is like a sitcom clich&eacute;, where a boast or prank goes too far.  Peter on the Brady Bunch claiming to know Joe Namath, is just one of many examples.  In this case however, things feel more real, as matters don't play out as silly harmless fun, with several allusions to much darker possibilities.Ron Eldard (Sleepers) is perfect as a burned out rocker still trying to cling to the ways of his youth.  Waxing poetic on the significance of BOC, and the talents of guitarist Buck Dharma, Jimmy is truly in his element.  Still bitter that his father crushed his musical dreams, his success is largely dependent on the talent of others.Lois Smith (Twister,Five Easy Pieces) is spot on as Jimmy's mom, who still has the ability to transform the forty year-old, into a little boy.  Many could play a loudmouth prick, but Bobby Cannavale does it with an authentic sense of New York style.  The talented and versatile Jill Hennessey (Law & Order,Crossing Jordan), is always a pleasure to watch.  Her musical talents bring great realism to Nikki, who is struggling with her own unrealized dreams.  Hennessy performs part of \"Ghost In My Head\", the title track from her 2009 album.While not completely original, Roadie largely works because it is thoughtfully written, and features some extremely talented actors.  Providing ample opportunities for reflection, this is a particularly interesting watch for those who have faced a midlife crisis, and is punctuated by a selection of music, which adds firmly to the film's impact.  Among the featured songs are Robin Trower's \"About To Begin\" and \"Long Misty Days\", Jethro Tull's haunting \"My God\", Blue Oyster Cult's \"Cites on Flame\", and perhaps most apropos, as it deals with the life of a roadie, \"The Load Out\", which is unfortunately not the original version performed by Jackson Browne."
B006H06CFO Answers to Nothing almost became a 3-star movie but thanks to the final 30 minutes making a dramatic improvement in storytelling, it's only fair to award it 4 stars.  It's about four separate stories happening at once, and I'll list them right now:1- Dane Cook is NOT a comedian in this film.  Let that be known right off the bat.  Instead he cheats on his wife with a woman who looks and sings remarkably similar to the legendary Patti Smith.  As you can guess, he's cheating because he doesn't get along with his wife.  Unfortunately there's a few exceptionally graphic and inappropriate sexual related scenes in the very beginning that I didn't really care for, however I suppose having \"it\" happen during a story about a World War II soldier parachuting down to a house in France with an attractive inside is an interesting spin.  You'll see what I mean when you watch the movie.2- An African American woman who has a certain hatred for other black folks and seeks help with a counselor to figure out why.  Sort of pointlessly weaved into the storyline if you ask me, since if you were to remove this segment it wouldn't have been a big loss.3- An attractive blonde-haired detective woman who wants to bring down a potential suspect involved in the abduction of a child that she strongly believes is responsible for the childs disappearance.  Unfortuantely this segment was *severely* lacking.  At least, the scenes involving the detective.  There's a REALLY good segment with the suspect near the end concerning a house break-in that's easily the best part of the movie.4- A woman who has to take care of her paralyzed brother by bathing and taking him for walks in his wheelchair.  I suppose her intention here is to get into proper running shape so she can continue to have the strength to take care of him, but the fact that she was in desperate need of assistance because of how straining of a job it was leads to some interesting segments with her family later on, and especially memorable is the running marathon segment near the end.The only problem is that on a few occasions the storyline really drags, especially from the 30 minute mark until the 1 hour and 15 minute mark.  That's a good 45 minutes of lackluster entertainment that tells a decent enough story to get the job done, but never does anything that truly stands out.  This is why it's quite difficult to give the movie 5 stars.  However the ending is REALLY darn good- all the events are convincingly and thoroughly explained by the conclusion.  Good movie."
B006H06CFO Writer/director Matthew Leutwyler manages to challenge the concentration and intellect and attention span of the viewer in this non-linear and ultimately satisfying intertwining of stories that examine the bad in the best of us and the good in the worst of us. Against the backdrop of a child abduction case (person of interest is next door neighbor Beckworth (Greg Germann) we follow five days in the life of Frankie, a single parent detective (Julie Benz) assigned to the case, her best friend Kate (Elizabeth Mitchell) whose determination to get pregnant keeps her from confronting Ryan (Dane Cook) her psychologist husband's infidelity with rock singer Tara (Aja Volkman) while he is attempting to reconcile his parents (his fragile mother played by Barbara Hershey) long separation, an on-line video game addicted  school teacher Carter (Mark Kelly) and his obsession with the missing child that pushes him to the edge of vigilantism, a beat cop Jerry (Erik Palladino) grieving over the violent death of his wife, Drew (Miranda Bailey) recovering addict and her wheel chair bound brother Erik (Vincent Vinteresca)preparing for the LA marathon, and Allegra (Kali Hawk), a self-loathing African American TV writer's search for love who happens to be a patient of Ryan's (and who is on the brink of a mixed courtships with a shy and likely virginal Evan played by Zack Gifford). The string of stories asks us to look at their lives (and ours!) and to take action where it is needed to end injustice.The cast of characters is so strong that despite the rather confusing progress o the story we get to know each character very well.  The ending is exceptionally well handled.  This is one o those surprise films that appears on the surface to be one of those shallow/too much too fast director's egomaniacal art films, but by film's end the audience simply cannot fail to be touched in many different positive ways. Grady Harp, August 12"
B006H06CFO This is what we call a major league indy plot with loosely connected characters...intertwine is the phrase they like to use to make it sound artsy. There is a missing young girl. Beckworth (Greg Germann) the neighbor is a person of interest. Frankie (Julie Benz) is the investigating officer. Her friend Kate (Elizabeth Mitchell) is the sweetest thing this side of candy, and she is married to a psychologist Ryan (Dane Cook) who lies and cheats. One of his patients is TV writer Allegra (Kali Hawk) who is African-American and hates blacks. There is also a woman who cares for her brother. He is in a vegetative state. She wants to push his wheelchair in a marathon. There is also a rock band, the woman Ryan is cheating with, a rookie cop, and a teacher so obsessed with the missing girl, that it screws up his on-line video role playing game.The film builds up multiple characters in a mostly boring fashion. It isn't until the climatic ending that you begin to feel you have just seen a decent film. This film reminded me in many ways of another indie, \"Garden Party.\" If you don't like one story or character, wait it will change. The acting was exceptional well, however a story being all over the place is not everyone's cup of tea. If you are not an indie fan, you may not enjoy this feature.F-bomb, sex, nudity."
B006H06CFO Every now and then a gem that i've never heard of sneaks up on me.Once in a while when you read the plot on the cover of the dvd at the rental store it doesn't let you down.\"Answers To Nothing\" fit that bill for me.What a little gem this movie is!It starts with a little girl getting kidnapped from her bedroom in the night by a deviant but in between the manhunt for the criminal and her is a bunch od stories mixed into thru the movie.A woman who takes care of her invalid brother and desperately tries to keep custody of him,even enters both of them in the l.a marathon,very heartwarming story.A couple trying to conceive by artificial ensemination,a man obsessed with the child kidnapping case,etc.Rent it...you won't be disapointed!!! 5 stars easily !!!"
B006H06CFO \"I'm buried in the armor, I'm an iron man.\" After a child is abducted this movie deals with the following five days and a group of people including the single mom who is investigating the case. Her sister (Mitchell) who wants to get pregnant badly but her husband (Cook) is cheating on her. A school teacher who is obsessed with finding the missing girl. An alcoholic who is taking care of her wheel chair bound brother and a self hating black woman who wants to fall in love. I have to begin by saying that this is not a movie for everyone. Very slow moving in some parts and not a happy movie at all. That said I really enjoyed this. Dane Cook is a huge surprise in this role and is actually a very good dramatic actor. This movie shows how each person is somehow intertwined in each other's lives and how one life effects the other. While not nearly as good as \"Crash\" it does have that type of feel to it. This is a movie that you must be in the mood for and is a struggle at first, but the last half hour makes you glad you stuck with it. Overall, the type of movie that leaves you thinking about it long after it is over. I recommend this. I give it a B."
B006I0GSZM This is a mediocre rendition of a Stephen King novel of the same name.It dragged a great deal and was more unpleasant than scary.A shame as the book was great"
B006I0GSZM If you are a Steven King fan, you will love this movie.  This held my interest from the very beginning to the end. I love thriller and suspense movies and this one fit that bill.  I loved the story line and the suspense was on the edge of your seat.  Absolutely loved it!  I gave it 5 stars as the acting, story line and the fact that Steven King did it again........so well!  Highly recommend it."
B006I0GSZM As always, Stephen King knows how to deliver a story. This is no exception and for those who like his work, they won't be disappointed."
B006I0GSZM It must have been deliberate.  Pierce Brosnan, of all people, looks like Stephen King in this adaptation of his novel!  The novel was one of King's best because he managed at long last to combine a horror story with a love story.  Love stories prior to this had pretty much eluded him although he tried. The tv show is rendered in much broader and bolder strokes than the novel.  There is always that tendency in screen adaptations of novels though.The scary stuff is plenty scary.  There is ghost after ghost in creepy rendition after creepy rendition.  If you are in the mood for horror, this is the tv show for you.The protagonist's wife is killed  in traffic while he is at a book signing.  He is devastated and retreats to their lakeside home in Maine. There he begins to wonder if his wife was seeing someone else.  He also meets someone new but she is locked in a custody battle with her child's rich paternal grandfather. It turns out to be a lot more complex problem though than an affair or a custody battle.  There is a mystery going back to his grandfather's generation which affected a circle of young men from the 1930s.King's best screen adaptations were Kubrick's THE SHINING starring Jack Nicholson, Rob Reiner's STAND BY ME with the late River Phoenix, Christopher Walken starring in his DEAD ZONE, Kathy Bates in her Oscar winning role with James Caan in MISERY and Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie in CARRIE. Those are pretty lofty standards for others to try to meet.  That is heavyweight film talent. They are all either Oscar winners or Oscar nominees. So doing it on tv with a good actor, but hardly a Walken, Caan or Nicholson, gives this less of a chance right from the start.  BAG OF BONES is a good job but it is not up there with these now classic five star films."
B006I0GSZM I also watched Bag of Bones on DVD which is based on a novel by Stephen King. I bought the book years ago on the bargain shelf at Barnes & Nobles. I read it quickly and loved it. When the miniseries aired back in December, I had other things going on and I didn't get a chance to watch it. Bag of Bones is good, but several things have been changed and left out from the book. I love ghost stories, so I naturally love it despite of it's flaws."
B006I0GSZM This Stephen King adaptation is much more entertaining and colorful than many of the other reviews here let on.  I'll admit, important elements of the novel were missing in this mini-series.  The single-mom character was much more complex and fleshed out in the novel, and some of the stranger, more interesting images and scenes from the book didn't make it into the movie.  However, I thought the ghost-story-mystery aspect of the film was old-fashioned and deliberately paced, and I thought it was very entertaining.  I like the fact that the movie slows down to tell the story without a lot of quick cuts and abrasive sound effects.  Pierce Brosnan's obsessive grief comes across as completely credible, in my opinion, and his performance goes a long way in making events believable.  Is this a higher-end King adaptation?  No, it is not.  However, I did think it was fun and engaging.  You might want to give it a chance if you're a fan of the kind of atmosphere and scripting that older ghost stories take on (Ghost Story, The Changeling, etc.).  After all of the terrible reviews I've read for this, I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie."
B006I0GSZM I thought it was good and wished it would have continued. The storyline was sad, but it was well written and there were times when I couldn't tell what was real and what was not real."
B006I0GSZM Had read the book many years ago and decided to watch this. Almost four hours long, if remember correctly, in two parts. Good acting and a very engaging story line. I am used to the edgier approach of movies instead of the restrained presentation of TV movies. That said, it was time well spent."
B006I0GSZM The sound was excellent.  The costumes, brilliant. Acting was right on for King 's book. It is thoroughly enjoyable entertainment."
B006I0GSZM Out of Stephen King's countless books, \"Bag of Bones\" is probably the easiest to adapt -- it's a straightforward ghost story about revenge, murder and writer's block.So of course it was eventually adapted into a TV miniseries of the same name, with Pierce Brosnan playing a bestselling author (take a shot) staying in a small Maine town (take a shot) with some ugly skeletons in its closet. The first half is a tedious affair, mostly setting up various clues for Brosnan -- but the second half is a genuinely disturbing, heartrending tale.After his pregnant wife Jo (Annabeth Gish) is killed by a runaway bus, writer Mike Noonan (Brosnan) is understandably devastated. He also finds himself unable to write, so he ends up heading off to the Maine lake-house that Jo had been fixing up for several months. He also is grappling with suspicions that Jo was unfaithful to him, since he was told that they couldn't have children.But during his stay, he begins to see strange ghostly events -- fridge magnets spell out messages, strong winds blow, and the music of 1930s blues singer Sara Tidwell (Anika Noni Rose) plays. Soon Mike figures out that there are two ghosts: one is Jo, and the other is far more malevolent.He also inadvertently becomes involved in a custody battle between wealthy, cruel Max Devore (William Schallert) and his beautiful daughter-in-law Mattie (Melissa George) over Mattie's young daughter Kyra (Caitlin Carmichael). But as Mike tries to figure out why Devore wants his granddaughter, he learns of a string of brutal murders stretching back through the years -- and the terrible crimes that started it all.The first episode of \"Bag of Bones\" moves at a very slow pace, primarily devoted to setting up the clues and the whole custody battle. In fact, a lot of it is about Mike drifting around, struggling to write and having strange visions that are (of course) prophetic -- and if it weren't for the occasional ghostly visitations, you might forget that this is a Stephen King story.One advantage of the slow episode is that it gives Brosnan plenty of time to develop Mike. Yes, he's another bestselling writer character with a personal tragedy, but it feels so much more REAL with Brosnan. He really makes you feel the life-destroying anguish of losing your spouse (possibly drawing from experience), and the passionate paternal feelings that Kyra stokes in him.But the second episode lashes together the horror, clues and custody battle into one dark, bloody package -- and suddenly the horror is flowing pretty quickly. Ironically, the most horrifying part is the human capacity for brutality (a graphic rape-murder scene, the attempts to kill children), but there is still plenty of ropy-faced zombies, curses and the occasional crazy old crone throwing rocks or scissors.One major problem, however, is Max Devore and his crazy sidekick Rogette. These characters are so utterly, revoltingly, sadistically evil that they become cartoons rather than antagonists -- it wouldn't surprise me if they tortured puppies for fun. And it's never really explained why various men want to kill a kid who isn't theirs. Do they think it will lift the curse? I have no idea.It takes its sweet time to drag itself to the horror content, but if you can hang on through the slow, character-building first episode, \"Bag of Bones\" is a dark and heartfelt ghost story."
B006I0GSZM First, it should be mentioned that I am a Stephen King fan. As far as I know, I've read all of his books, and \"Bag of Bones\" was one of my favorites. I loved everything about it- the summer Maine setting, the characters, and the \"traditional\" ghost story setup. It would be unreasonable to expect every detail of the novel to be crammed into a two episode TV mini-series. Instead, the producers did a great job of cutting where they had to, making small changes where necessary, but mostly retaining the story and the FEEL of King's \"Bag of Bones\". Be warned that it can (and will) get cheesy at times, but that's part of the charm.I watched this on rainy October evening, with a warm Labrador curled on my lap, a mug of hot chocolate near at hand. This was a great experience- nothing too mind blowing or horrific (I'm not a huge fan of horror movies); just a good, comfortable ghost story. It's mostly a harmless affair, with moderate amounts of tension (undoubtedly reduced since I had already read the novel) and no excess gore. Instead, the story revolves around psychological fear and exploration, with a solid performance turned in by Pierce Brosnan (King fans are lucky to have him on board for this TV adaptation). If you're fan of King's work, or ghost stories in general, grab a mug of hot chocolate on a cool fall evening, tune in, and enjoy."
B006I0GSZM Why people should expect a movie to emulate a book makes no sense. They are totally different mediums with their own strengths to be taken advantage of and weaknesses to be avoided. They are separate stories that share a common bond. Example: I thought \"Help\" was better as a book (actually what my imagination created) than as a movie but the movie had it's acting strengths.As far as \"Bag of Bones\" it was too formula driven and loaded with stereotypes. Usual writer searching for inspiration; loses wife; goes to rural Maine (of course); encounters murder mysteries; has dreams; has romantic affair; things turn inexplicably on and off; windows/doors/drawers open & close; bad townsfolk are hiding a secret; spirits appear; spirits lose power when dug up. Help! How repetitively redux.Acting was OK but dialogue sounds like it came from a too cloistered Hollywood writer - simply not realistic conversations. CGI effects of ghostly dead people was standard '40s movie making boring. Some effects were more laughable than scary such as lightning hitting a sign which happens to land on and kill some townsfolk (cheaply shown as an old pickup catching fire) and a tree that looks sort of human shaped that gives a jolt when touched, finally a CGI face appears on the trunk while a branch or two take a swat at our hero-writer (the trees in \"Alice...\" and in \"Wizard of Oz\" were scarier)."
B006I0GSZM Fantastic story line and great acting.  Several twists and turns with intrigue and horror to make you hang on to every moment.  If you haven't seen a movie that deals with a good mix of supernatural and reality, you don't want to miss this one."
B006I0GSZM It's been many years since I read Bag of Bones, so I don't know if I'd be nitpicking the details of this movie more if I'd read the book more recently, but I thought it was solid.  Like most TV movies, some of the acting was really good, and some not so much.  Pierce Brosnan as Mike Noonan was a highlight.  He's one of the most accomplished actors to take a lead role in a Stephen King adaptation, and he didn't take it lightly.  Many actors struggle at being believable in a supernatural tale, but I thought Brosnan came off as genuine in every scene where he interacted with the forces around Dark Score Lake.  He also did great expressing Mike's grief in the first part, showing that he still has formidable dramatic talent.  Being a longtime fan of King, I can't help but think it's incredibly cool that a former James Bond played a Stephen King character.  I'm sure King didn't mind it too much, either.  Out of the other important characters, I thought Max Devore was done well, and the girl who played Kyra did an excellent job.  Mattie, Sarah Tidwell, and Jo were passable, and most of the secondary characters, like Bill Dean and the housekeeper, were fine.  Lowlights for me were Mrs. Devore, who was cartoonish, and the officer who harasses Mike. Like I said, though, you can't usually expect an all-star ensemble when it's made for TV.  On that point, some of the special effects aren't so special with the TV budget, but some of it was actually quite good, particularly a couple of gruesome death scenes and some zombie-esque ghosts.  This movie also has several old-school horror \"jump\" moments that are effective at startling the hell out of you even though you know something is about to happen. All in all, I've seen worse Mick Garris-directed films, and maybe only a couple that are better.  Brosnan carries the cast, and the source material is strong enough to make for an entertaining 2 and 1/2+ hours.  It felt to me by the end that I had experienced something close to a novel, with enough mystery, drama, and suspense to keep my full attention.  I'd give it a solid B."
B006I0GSZM Mike Noonan (Pierce Brosnan) a novelist with writer's block after the tragic death of his wife Jo (Annabeth Gish)  decides to get away to their summer place by a lake. He has high hopes to communicate with his wife beyond the grave and he soon starts to once he arrives. But the ghost of a dead singer, named Sara Tidwell (Anika Joni Rose) also starts to communicate with him their through an old recordplayer.He also finds himself in the middle of a custody battle between a widower, Mattie (Melissa George) and her evil father in-law Max Devore (William Schallert) when he saves Mattie's daughter from getting hit by a car. Since Max is a powerful man, he wants to bully Mike into admitting that Mattie is a bad mom and that she wasn't watching her child. In-order to help Mattie's daughter, like Jo wants him to, Mike must discover the town's dark secrets.The film is a decent adaption of the Stephen King book, but that's all director Mick Garris, is capable of, either decent adaptions, like this and the Stand or really bad ones, like Desperation. What makes Bag of Bones only decent is that it just moves along slowly with Pierce Brosnan acting pretty casual about being haunted or the other strange happenings. Melissa George acts pretty casual about the strange things going on as well. The director, takes an interesting story and manages to make it kind of dull and not even scary.I think a more talented director could have got better performances out of Brosnan and George since they aren't bad actors. Garris should only be handed King adaptions that weren't big successes. For instance, he needs to be kept away from the Dark Tower, Under the Dome, Duma Key, Insomnia, the Talisman or anything else that has potential as a movie or mini-series."
B006I0GSZM Whenever another television adaptation of a Stephen King novel comes around, I always feel a little wary. Some of his supernatural offerings seem better suited left to the imagination as opposed to getting a literal screen treatment. That's not to say that there haven't been good interpretations. There have. But there have been just as many failures as successes. If anyone should have a sense of King, it is director Mick Garris who collaborated on previous TV efforts include \"The Stand\" and the much maligned \"The Shining\" miniseries. For me, \"Bag of Bones\" falls squarely in the middle ground of King's television presentations. It has been simplified and changed in ways that purists and/or fans of the novel may not appreciate. But for those unfamiliar with the story, it has its share of pleasures as well. For those expecting big scares, however, the pacing of this two-part miniseries may be a little off-putting. I would describe this as a melancholy murder mystery enhanced by supernatural elements as opposed to any kind of horror show.Not surprisingly, King sticks close to the topics he knows. The protagonist in \"Bag of Bones\" is (once again) a popular writer, played by Pierce Brosnan, who is pushed to the brink of sanity in picturesque Maine. Reeling from a personal tragedy and trying to push through writer's block, Brosnan settles into his family's lakefront country estate. The town is populated by a typical array of eccentrics including a plucky single mother (Melissa George) and an evil town bigwig (TV stalwart William Schallert). It seems that this quaint little berg has seen its share of unpleasantness with a series of murderous drownings through the years. Brosnan starts communing with spirits in the afterlife, and the central mystery seems to have something to do with a blues singer named Sara Tidwell (Anika Noni Rose) of a bygone era. Past and present meet as Brosnan seeks to establish a connection and put a long standing mystery to rest.The leisurely pace allows the viewer to really get to know Brosnan, and he gives a solid lived-in performance. The cast also has Jason Priestly, Matt Frewer, and Annabeth Gish (perhaps the most underrated actress working), but none of them has anything to do before all but disappearing. George is likable enough, but the teleplay doesn't really establish a relationship between her and Brosnan before forcing them together. Schallert is menacing fun and his female companion is a hoot. Noni Rose gets a couple of welcome musical numbers, but isn't developed with much depth. Everything is so straightforward and uncomplicated in this adaptation, it is never very hard to envision where the screenplay is taking you. And when you finally get there, it is so rushed and rather unconvincing.It's fair to say that this adaptation of \"Bag of Bones\" lacks the subtleties and shadings of the novel--but that's probably to be expected. If you aren't anticipating big thrills or an exact replication of the book's plot, I might still recommend this for Brosnan's performance. Without commercials, this clocks in at just over three hours. I, personally, liked this slow build (although someone who watched with me declared it a snooze-fest). I just wished that when we got to the conclusion, it had offered up something of a surprise. Still, it was enjoyable enough. However, it is not a particularly memorable endeavor when you think about all of the King adaptations that have been produced through the years (would they and could they all be made by Frant Darabont for the big screen!). KGHarris, 12/11."
B006I0GSZM I love Pierce Brosnan so this show was a shoe-in for me to begin with.  Though it used a lot of cliche scary effects, it had an net resting enough plot to keep me intrigued."
B006I0GSZM This lost my attention ten minutes in. It was stupid, flat and boring and I never finished it. It didn't live up to Steven King's other works."
B006I0GSZM I have always loved the imagination of Stephen King and this series on A&E; called the \"Bag of Bones\" relates to what I had been through with the loss of the only man I have ever loved.  The thinking they are there in a room with you or they have sent you a sign telling you how to handle their passing.  Pierce Bronson is perfect in the role and the rest of cast was chosen well.  That is one thing I like about Stephen King he does not let Hollywood or Television change his stories they are just like the books he writes.  Wonderful Series and I intend to buy it to see them all on my laptop to know how it ends is what makes King a great writer, as you never know how he will end his stories.  Great work this series is by a wonderful writer of so much that a world enjoys the challenge of how the story proceeds and ends.  Thank you Amazon for giving this to your customers to enjoy....Link to Bag of Bones Series -http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006I0GSZM/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
B006I0GSZM It's what I'd watch when there was nothing else at all and I had gone through all my DVDs and feel like &#34;well, that was OK&#34;"
B006I0GSZM Not my cup of tea.  Used as background noise while using my PC mostly.  I really don't think casting a British &#34;pretty boy&#34; as a Maine outdoors &#34;man&#34; fit the part either."
B006I0GSZM This is how I choose movies from the Roku my husband got for his birthday from my daughter.  It was a tense and unsettling to watch and a satisfying end.  I'm giving it 4 stars because I waited too long to write this and think I would remember it better if it were 5 star material.  Still think I'll be watching it again, which is a good test of the experience."
B006I0GSZM The story was a bit contrived but the acting excellent.  Always a surprise ending with Stephen King who leaves you hanging until the last."
B006I0GSZM Pierce Bronson plays Michael Noonan, a New England author, in a continuing of Stephen King's write about things you are series. When is wife, who he truly loved, dies, he is drawn to their lake home. Noonan has nightmares about his wife in the final scene of \"Quarantine\". At the lake home he inadvertently gets involved in a local drama and discovers some small town secrets that frankly would make a good novel, which BTW he has to write.I enjoyed the simple ghostly images and hauntings. Noonan takes the paranormal in stride as he tries to uncover more about the illness known as Dark Score Crazy which causes people to drown their daughters. What is unfortunate is any Stephen King fan can watch the film and see where the master has done this before. For instance when we see the computer screen with the same line written over and over, one can not help think about \"The Shining.\" The question begs: Does King want us to think about \"The Shining\" and give us a clue that Noonan is crazy or is it a deliberate misdirection? Or maybe King is starting to recycle old trunk novels as does the writer in the story. Outside of Noonan, the characters were poorly developed, especially considering the length of the film.While I enjoyed the film, I have come to expect more from Stephen King.Made for TV. Includes a rape scene."
B006I0GSZM I enjoyed watching this mini-series duo of broadcasts. The acting is good. Brosnan is convincing as the main character. There are some odd situations, but the plot carries you along most of the time. Since there are only 2 episodes to this series, the viewer is quickly pushed to the main character's situations. It would have been nice to have 2 more episodes or more to flesh out settings and characters. The topping to this is a classic Stephen King ending... you'll know it when you see it."
B006I0GSZM That's about it.  He is engaging, but the rest of it is actually a dull slog despite the storyline, violence, and other characters.  Too bad.  I am sure the book was better; I read it some time ago, since I always read King's work."
B006I0GSZM Adapting a Stephen King novel to the screen has proved to be a dicey proposition for writers/directors in the past.  Either the film is a huge hit (like \"Shawshank Redemption\" or \"Green Mile\"), or it turns into a B-movie that doesn't nearly live up to the billing.  In the case of \"Bag of Bones\", director Mick Garris does a remarkable job of translating the page to the screen.For a basic plot summary, \"Bag of Bones\" sees writer Mike Noonan (Pierce Brosnan) struggling with severe writers block after the death of his wife Jo (Annabeth Gish).  To try and break out of his funk, Mike heads to his summer retreat home on Dark Score lake, where Jo had frequented often.  While there, Mike meets Mattie Devore (Melissa George) and her daughter Kyra (Caitlin Carmichael), who draw him into a haunting (literally!) mystery surrounding town baron Max Devore (William Schallert) & the unexplained death of 1930s jazz songstress Sara Tidwell (Anika Noni Rose).What makes \"Bag of Bones\" really work is the fact that it doesn't stray too much from the original King subject matter.  It had been awhile since I read the novel, so I can't nit-pick all that much, but the film seemed to do a good job of sticking to the script, so to speak, and not deviate from King's wonderfully compelling (and spooky) tale.The acting, for the most part, is also quite fine.  Brosnan is very capable as the lead, while only a couple of the key auxiliary roles are sub-par.  Special credit needs to be given to little Ms. Carmichael, who really gives the show its emotional kick throughout.About the only thing this film doesn't translate well from the book are the \"villain\" characters (you'll know who they are after you watch).  In the book, I seem to remember much more character development about them, which was excised from this adaptation likely due to time.  It shows a bit in the end, when t
B006LG7IJ8 What I love about this show is there isn't one second that isn't outright silliness.There is so much comedic creativity here. The two lead characters even do gender reversals with the woman dressed as a man with his girlfriend in her red wig played by the man. And they do it so well including the voices, that it's easy to forget who is whom and just laugh.The people are all whacky, the situations are all outlandish, and the entire city apparently is off kilter. I can't wait to go there after watching this. While this is extreme craziness I do feel that there is a lot of truth here about how Portland actually is after knowing some charming delightful people from there. I was wondering if it was just this particular group of friends that seemed funnier than people I know on the east coast or what but now I'm thinking it's a funny place in general.This show keeps the spacey hipster goofiness coming at you non stop. It seems like the initial burst of steam the first season displayed has quieted down several notches.It's still funny but not hilareous like it was. And what makes it so special is it seems to frequently feature situations we are all familiar with. Waiting in line for hours at a popular restaurant for a table, overeager parents of a preschooler trying desperately to get their boy into the right preschool, the child hearing his parents making funny sounds in the bedroom, are some of the episodes.This show is more creative than most things out there and is a breath of fresh air. Not many shows make me smile and laugh any more but this one lightens my mood better than any."
B006LG7IJ8 I was hesitant about this show. I am not sure why, but I put off trying it for a long time. Then I heard some interviews with Carrie Brownstein and she seemed like an interesting and intelligent person so I decided to watch the first season. I liked it, but I was not blown away. At some point in the second season that changed. I laughed as hard as I have ever laughed in my entire life at some of the sketches in this second season. I was actually in physical pain from laughing at some of the sketches. That is when I knew I was a convert.The writing on the show is excellent and very consistent. Obviously, some sketches are funnier than others, but the percentage of really funny sketches on this show is, I think, higher than any other sketch show I have ever watched. I have also come to really love the recurring characters. I think that is part of the reason I liked the second season better than the first. It took a little while for some of the characters to grow on me, and I think it took me a little while to really figure out the sensibility of the show, but now that I have figured out the sensibility, and gotten to know the characters, it has really become one of my favorite shows.Fred and Carrie are also really good comic actors. That is probably no surprise with Fred since he has been a staple cast member on Saturday Night Live for ten years, but it is amazing to me what a great comic actor Carrie is. She delivers her lines perfectly. Some of the humor in this show can be subtle. Some of it is not subtle at all. But a lot of it is the kind of comedy that would not necessarily crack you up on the page, but delivered correctly it is genius, and Fred and Carrie always deliver it beautifully.The whole show just has a really great feel. Every sketch feels like the kind of thing that you come up with when you are sitting around with your friends and someone says something funny, or introduces some funny premise, and then someone else takes it further, and someone else takes it further, and so on, until everyone is laughing so hard they can barely stand it. Watching this show is like that. The show really feels like it is just friends having fun and it seems, from the interviews I have seen with Fred and Carrie, like that is an accurate account of how this show came into being. I think that whole sensibility carries over into the show and makes it a really enjoyable viewing experience.There is one sketch from this season that I have to single out. It was the sketch where a bunch of kids are at a museum and Fred and Carrie are playing Lewis and Clark. I don't know what it was about that sketch. It is a really weird sketch in some ways, but I am not exaggerating when I say that I laughed harder at that sketch than I have ever laughed at anything in my life (\"I don't know why you're running!...They are still running...\") Any show that can take such a weird, silly, premise, and make me laugh that hard, deserves my absolute seal of approval. If you have been hesitant about this show, as I was, I recommend giving it a try as soon as possible."
B006LG7IJ8 Penny Marshall guest starred in this show. The small part was perfect for her. Portlandia is not for everyone, the humor is a acquired taste but I enjoy the quirkiness of the characters."
B006LG7IJ8 The humor is clever but not funny for me personally. I get it but a big &#34;so what&#34; in my way of being. I prefer comedy which has me laughing out loud some of the time and holds my interest."
B006LG7IJ8 I used to live in Portland, kind of get the self-conscious posturing of Portland denizens; kind of phony, but at heart sincere and well-intentioned. Carrie and Fred have nailed the lifestyle-I remember waiting in line for an hour for famous pancakes that supposed to be organic, natural and healthy, but were as dense as corrugated iron. Enjoy the easy-going spoofing and seeing the sites of Portland-it really is a beautiful place."
B006LG7IJ8 I love these crazy actors! they'll do anything for a laugh, the impersonations of the west coast portlandereeer's is extremely funny!"
B006LG7IJ8 In their continued, playful lambasting of hipsters, progressives, and weirdos of Portland (not to mention their smaller sister of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, ahem), Carrie and Fred do a marvelous job of bringing fresh fun to sketch comedy. Not only can they pickle eggs, cucumbers, and assorted inedible objects, they can also give just about any concept their funky \"pickling\" treatment.The chemistry between these two is downright magical, and the variations in the identities they assume is stunning. You always know that it's Fred and Carrie (obviously), but the transformation in their delivery and personality as they change roles is fascinating to watch, along with the mostly subtle visual changes (like Fred's awesome selection of wigs).Favorite moments from Season Two include Andy Samberg starring as a mixologist in one episode, Fred and Carrie attempting to take over the role of Portland law enforcement, and the induction of Kevin into the band \"Cat Nap\". Looking forward to Season Three!"
B006LG7IJ8 As a Portland resident, I'll admit that it's nice to see the town in high-quality photography, and I'll agree that most of the caricatures are quite spot on. However, I've never been a great fan of the show for a couple reasons. One is that the same ideas are milked over and over, often using the same characters, with no new ground being broken. The feminist bookstore is probably the best example: Each successive skit in that setting seems to be just a variation on the original idea, without reaching for additional substance or a new perspective. Another problem is that Armisen and especially Brownstein seem to equate inarticulate mugging with comedy. This just in: They're not the same thing. Sputtering your lines, raising your eyebrows or tossing objects is no substitute for true humor. There are some skits that are nice in the way that a short poem is, and of all the routines in this season I think the Battlestar Galactica one is truly inspired, though it does go on a little too long in the middle. This series is adequately diverting most of the time, but it's hardly as good as it thinks it is. Still, I'll keep watching in hopes of someday seeing Union Station in high definition...."
B006LG7IJ8 By this season they were like 50's jazz at Birdland.  If one player ever became predictable, others would counter or shift it.  Every episode is a mini Christopher Guest movie...which means exaggerated silly and absurd behavior from characters who often lack self awareness.  The \"Catnapped\" episode may even be funnier than the Sarah Silverman Program's \"Tab\" episode or Eastbound and Down's \"Cookout\" episode."
B006LG7IJ8 This show twerks the quirk. What can I say, it's so strange that I love it. It reminds me of that stuck-up boyfriend I had that always went on and on about &#34;PORTLAND is so GREAT because..... &#34; with his nose in the air. He was such a tool. I sincerely hope he moved there and drowned in a craft beer. Ugh. Anyway, unlike Jeremy, this show was cool. The city seems to be a lot like East Nashville- kind of insufferable, but adorable, in the way a small, confused child is when they're constantly running after shiny new toys and getting obsessed with every new fad they see.God I love this show. I guess I'm kind of like the people on it, which is why I really hate it so much. I'm so confused. Inside every hipster is a lot of self-loathing, mixed with an equal amount of self-importance. I'm so confused. Great show, though!"
B006LG7IJ8 Porlandia and its inhabitants will be familiar to anyone who practices green ethics, shops at the coop and is generally left of center (and proud of it!).  Hipsters, old hippies, overly involved parents and trendiness are all given a wonderful satirical going over in this show.  My personal favorite...\"Gotta get the Gear\"..... since I definitely buy too much junk when I get into a hobby.  You do not have to live in Portland to enjoy this...Eugene, Davis, Eureka or any of the other small cities that are inhabited by us greensters will do.  I laugh at each episode and recognize myself in the sends ups.  Good fun.  Well I am off to REI and Trader Joe's cause I gotta get the gear."
B006LWHBDA I chose this rating because its really just all informative reviews of their opinions in what they do and how they do it when they go to these auctions.  Most reality shows are stupid and don't have meaning or purpose.  Just a bunch of people getting together to tell the world of their lives and businesses they make money off of.  It is okay for some people; there are better things to watch for entertainment.  My husband watches this stuff.  It is a waste of my money and my time.  Somethings shouldn't be aired more than once or twice and this is one of them."
B006LWHBDA Fun show to watch for quick laughs, it's not &#34; Under The Dome &#34; it's like a 30 Min. sitcom but some funny characters to say the least."
B006LWHBDA Same as the original storage wars but with a colorful Texas twist. Love the down home accents. This is a keeper."
B006LWHBDA I liked this season better than the others do far. Only a few into it but the players are comical"
B006LWHBDA I buy auction units in Southern California in Dotson territory.  These guys are really nice and make the auctions fun.  My issue is the California show has run the price of the units sky high.  My wife and I will watch the show and say what we would pay for the auctions in question.  We always seem to be to low for California but right on for Texas.  The characters in this show are good and the merchandise that is won is pretty interesting.  I would like to go to Texas to go to one of these auctions just based on this show.  It is fun to watch and it is a good time.  Watch it, you wont be disappointed."
B006LWHBDA I believe a lot of these shows are fake, meaning that the situations are scripted and the valuable items are strategically placed.  Whatever.  Even if this show is like that (and, I'm not sure if it is or not), I watch these shows to learn about antiques and collectibles.  This show has that!  They buy some cool stuff and I'm learning about different items and what their value might be. Don't watch it to critique the reality of the episodes.  Watch it to learn and see some cool stuff coming out of the storage lockers!"
