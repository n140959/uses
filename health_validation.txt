159985130X This is a great little gadget to have around.  We've already used it to look for splinters and a few other uses.  The light is great.  It's a handy size.  However, I do wish I'd bought one with a little higher magnification.
159985130X I would recommend this for a travel magnifier for the occasional reading.I had read on another review about a magnifier having a problem with the light coming on. I did find that this one appeared to be DOA out of the box. But, after opening & shutting the viewer to turn on & off the light, the light began to come on. After several times of doing this, the light appears to be coming on all the time.It is small, but for taking it someplace & reading things like a menu in a dark corner of a restaurant, this is great.
159985130X What I liked was the quality of the lens and the built in light.  Then lens had no discernable distortion anywhere.  It magnified everything evenly without the ripples and  distortion that I've seen with other low cost magnifiers.  This light is a nice touch and easy to use.  If you want it on just pull the lens out a bit.  It is focused very close to the center of what you will be look at and provides nice, even coverage.What I didn't like was the brightness (actually dimmness) of the light and where it is focused.  LEDs can be lots brighter, I know as I've seen them.  Also, the light focuses at the center of you field of view but only when the lens is too close to be focused properly.Bottom line is this is a good value for a magnifier and could have been made great with better quality control.BTW, I feel that honest, effective reviews can take the place of first-hand experiences that are lacking in online shopping. I've always appreciated the help I've received from other reviewers and work hard to return the favor as best as I can.  I hope you found this review helpful and if there was anything you thought was lacking or unclear leave a comment and I'll do what I can to fix it.
159985130X Love the Great point light pocket magnifier!  works great, especially if you forget your glasses and can't read the menu when you are out for dinner.... the light is a bonus in a dark restaurant, too.  I would have given 5 stars if it came with a case that covers the glass.  The clear plastic case it comes in is a little tacky and I'd be willing to pay a little more for a nice case to protec the lens.
159985130X This is very nice. You pull out on the magnifier when you want the light to come on, then slide it back in. I would recommend buying this if you need something with a light that you can easily put in your pocket or purse.
159985130X The light comes on when the item is pulled.  This is much easier to use than the plastic bookmark magnifier and the bar magnifier I previously purchased.  I was glad to have it lit when I needed to see the serial number on the back of  an ipod.
159985130X These are lightweight and efficient and have some very good points:- the batteries last 2-3 months with daily use.- the LED is bright enough and adequately covers the whole magnified area under the 3X lens-- the lens itself is glass and good quality- the shell is plastic and it&#8217;s very light (but may not take a beating over time)-  it&#8217;s easy to open and turn on the light and the sliding mechanism has never failedI bought a six-pack of these from another vendor and all I can say is to shop around because prices vary tremendously.  I use this magnifier to inspect seeds and leaves.  I keep these magnifiers on my desk, in my briefcase, and in a backpack and I like them a lot.
159985130X We bought one for road trips and trying to interpret maps without having to strain our eyes. Really nice design, good tactile feel. I couldn't figure out where the batteries were, sent Lightwedge Customer Service an email and received a response within 24 hours. If you need one I'd recommend this one.
159985130X The screen of the magnifier is small. If you're looking to read text this is not going to work. Though I have not attempted to replace the battery, battery container seems to be contained by a very small screw-A Phillips screwdriver-of which would have to be incredibly small. I dread having to replace his battery.
159985130X This pocket magnifier is nice and compact.  The slide out feature makes it so it will fit into a small area when storing.  Light is nice and bright
159985130X Seems to be a legit 3X.  I bought my first and everything perfect.  So I bought a 2nd for my nephew - but that one had the light issue someone else mentioned (really dim, flickering).  Before I sent it back, I wanted to check the batteries - so I unscrewed where they are, took them out, but it looked like the contact on the right battery on the unit(uses 2 small watch-like ones) had some kind of grime on it - wiped that off, and I also bent the little tab to stick out a little more to give it a better contact on the battery - did that for the other side as well (it's different because of the +/- but you can bend both sides out a little).  After that, put the batteries back in and it works like my good one.
159985130X I'll admit it.  I fought like crazy when people started suggesting that I get a magnifying glass.  Yes, I could no longer some menu descriptions, especially in low light.  And when I needed to see the model number on an electronic device's sticker, and couldn't, well, that was a problem too.  After I accepted that I had a problem, I refused to get an old-fashioned magnifier, like my mother uses.  So, I looked around and this caught my eye (haha). I've been using it for a few weeks now and I love it.  It is black and sleek, and, yes gets the job done.  And, those low light environments?  No longer a problem, since this has a built in light that turns on when you slide open the magnifier.
159985130X This magnifier is just what I was looking for. It is small and easy to hold. I wanted something to read small numbers/characters on electronic stuff like computers, electronics, etc. I also work on the insides of computers and this is great for seeing small things. I don't want to magnify books or magazines. The light works well and makes reading small things very easy.
159985130X Most of the purses I own have black lining.  Good luck finding anything black in black purse!  I chose this color because I can actually find it!!!  It works wonderfully in a dimly lit restaurant, when the print is really small, when I need a light & a magnifier to find the splinter.  WONDERFUL.
159985130X I got two of these - one for my mom and one for my mother-in-law, both in their 80s.  What I wonder is why i didn't get one for me?  I will be wanting to order another for myself.  These were a big hit for these ladies and so useful.  As we age, we need more light to see what was once easy for us to read.  Often we are in areas where the lighting is poor or minimal.  This answers that need.  If you are looking for a product like this, try it.  It will meet your needs.
159985130X I only gave this 4 stars instead of 5, because of the packaging it comes in.  The plastic is sharp & isn't that easy to carry in your bag without stabbing yourself on it, but without the plastic box, the magnifier would get very scratched.  I may discard the plastic box, but keep the magnifier in something soft, like a small sock.  Otherwise, the magnifier works great.
159985130X This is a great little portable magnifier with light.  I bought 2 of them so I could keep one in my purse and have one for my desk.  However, my husband liked the blue one so much he took off with one and now I need to re-order!It is slightly curved so it feels good in your grip.  Closed, it measures about as long as your standard full-sized desktop mouse and about a half inch thick.  The viewing glass area is about as big as the face/screen of a flip style cell phone.  When open it emits an impressively strong light that works like a champ in the darkest of rooms. As it is an LED light it should have a very long operating life as LEDs don't require a lot of power.  Presumably the battery could be changed if needed as there is a small door with a single screw located behind where the light is housed.  5 stars!
159985130X This magnifier has nothing to cover it when not in use.I compared it with a Carson 3x magnifier and this one did not seem as clear as the Carson - hard to see the furigana clearly in Japanese comic books with this one.The Carson ones come with a cover.I would recommend the Carson 5x if you are looking for good size enlarging.Carson MiniBrite 5x Power Slide- Out MagnifierI wish I had skipped the 3x and gone with the 5x only.For this one in the 3x, the light works well and lights things up nicely.Carson MiniBrite 5x Power Slide- Out Magnifier
159985130X I carry this around in my bag (just in case).  I will have to make a little sleeve for it so that I can cut down on the lint & scratches that it collects, though.  It works very well and is the perfect size--not too big to be gauche, not too small to be ineffective.
159985130X UPDATE: This model has been bought out by Walgreens. The newer Walgreens version uses three AAA batteries instead of the CR1130 batteries this obsolete model uses. Go to the Walgreens website to find it. You cannot buy it on their website, but Walgreens online has a zip code locator for a stocking store near you. Search Walgreens site search for \"magnifier\". Also look at Walgreens branded \"Walgreens Led Magnifold 2X Rectangular Folding Magnifier\". It's a lot bigger hand held grip. It's listed under $14.These are no longer available through Amazon. They were $10 each. Those are sold out and have not been replenished. I have seen these exact same lighted magnifiers listed under the Walgreens brand for $15. I assume Walgreens bought the rights. They've done that with a lot of very popular products.My elderly Mother loves this lighted magnifier. I love it too. So many things out there I cannot read because the print is small and the background color washes out the letters (dark). From over the counter pill bottles to every day packaging, this thing is a life saver.
1933622865 purchased this for someone who has macular degeneration and she actually cried when she used it because she had not been able to read a newspaper for a couple years. Although I also bought her a small hand-held magnifier, this covers a large area so you don't have to continually move the magnifier back and forth across the page.This allows it to be of use for reading large pages such as a newspaper or a full menu, for example.The fact that it is rigid allows it to be held more easily without it bending as some do which causes blurring and distortion of the page.
1933622865 I bought this for my hubby who has the beginning of Macular Degeneration. I see him using it so I believe that it helps him.
1933622865 I purchased for a friend who has ARMD ..... she loves it, it is a great buy.  I was quite impressed with this one, think I will get one for myself.
1933622865 After cataract surgery I was unable to read.  This magnifier was a big help in seeing small print and even the computer screen.  My only complaint is it has to be held which got tiring really quickly. It also tends to distort slightly but not enough to be a big problem.
1933622865 Easy to use when I have an 8X11 hard copy document that I want to read without moving a magnifying glass around. Very light weight and easy to hold above page for the desired magnification.
1933622865 You have to be in the right spot to eliminate the outside reflections, but it does a good job of magnifying the print.  It's worth the money.  I would recommend though that you lightly sand the edges with a piece of fine sandpaper when you get it.  The edges were pretty sharp.
1933622865 I recently saw this at a local AC Moore store.  They had one open so you could try it out.  I only tried it for less than 10 minutes but that was enough.  Personally I think this is one of the worst ideas I have seen in a long time that is a product of one of those annoying TV commercials.  The idea of it is that it supposed to be easier to hold this thing over your book and hover it there continuously while you read, as opposed to just wearing glasses, ....Or something. (I think a newer model I saw on TV recently has a light, but that doesn't come off as any improvement on it in my opinion).  No question that if you get this thing just right it can magnify the page of your book or whatever it is you are using it for, but the fact that it actually works is where the benefits of this thing ends.  For starters, even if you are not reading one of the books that requires two hands for it closes on you the second you relax your grip on it,(as most of them are), this thing has to be positioned just right all the time in order to magnify the page successfully.  Move it back and forth just a little and your page becomes a blur.  There are no attachments to this thing, your hand is the tool, and in no time you start to have it get tired, go to sleep, etc.  There is not even a handle anywhere on this thing.  You just hold it someplace along the edge where you can sometimes find yourself magnifying nothing but your own finger.  Lastly, this thing is not glare resistant.  Depending on your light source, you will occasionally have to move or adjust it just to see.  Or better yet, forget about it it all together which is what I sugg
1933622865 Less helpful than a good magnifying glass. Just a waste of money. If you have vision problems, don't fall for any of these gadgets. Buy a good magnifying glass instead. It might cost a little more but will be well worth it.
1933622865 Several reviews of similar items reported &#34;too flimsy&#34; - you shouldn't see that complaint with this. Large enough for a full page of many magazines and virtually any book.
1933622865 This magnifies modestly well, is lightweight, and magnifies only at a certain distance from the page. Barely worth the price.
1933622865 Bought for my mother due her eye sight going downhill. She said she still can not read what she wants to she said her little magnifier that has a light on it is better. She said she would not recommend.
1935009656 The magnification isn't all that strong but having the bright light helps decipher the small print on medicine bottles and so on.It's easy to press the buttons on the side to eject the lens out from inside the bottom compartment.  It's the only one I could find that completely fits inside a built-in compartment. It's a little wide for my hand; about 2 3/4\" wide.
1935009656 Purchased for my husband and he loved it so much wanted another one for work. They are very handy to have around.
1935009656 A very good magnifier.  And the LED produces a very sharp light.Since it is an LED it should not need new batteries for quite a while.I bought this because I needed to read numbers on the back of a watch and none of the others were good enough.  This one did it right away.
1935009656 This magnifier is convenient, in that it is in a container, so it prevents scratches on the glass, but it's a lot bulkier than I expected it to be. Also, you have to move the angle of the glass around or the lettering looks distorted at times, and I don't like the 6x magnifier at the bottom right corner of the lens - it's distracting. The LED light comes in extremely handy in the dark, and is nice and bright, but only on the side of the glass that the light is located. It does it's job, i guess, but not what I expected.
1935009656 I bought this item for my husband to read small print as his eyesight was not good.  I borrowed it so many times, that I decided to get one for myself.  Both are used greatly on fine print on our prescription bottles any many other things where they insist on using small print on ingredients, etc. I design and sew  fashions and use it in my design studio every time I have to rip and resew a seam.  I always check with  Amazon when looking for an item.  The PRIME shipping saves a lot of money.
1935009656 For the price this little magnifier works well for routine things like reading labels in the grocery, restaurant menus and the like.  But, I wouldn't want to read a book with it.The sliding cover keeps fingers off the lens and the light is bright.  Uses three AAA batteries, not included.
1935009656 I like this thing.  Works well, except the light switch is iffy.  You have to jiggle the lense to get the light on sometimes.  Otherwise it works very well.
3812028492 great quality, feels very good in my hand, very good weight, non slippery handle. it's a very good buy, cant wrong with this one. 34c is also very good, but shorter handle.
3812028492 Make no mistake this is a sturdy long handled razor. Feels substantial in your hand and the finish makes it easy to hold onto when wet. Easy to keep clean with the two piece design. Plating was beautiful and very good quality razor.
3812028492 Real nice build to this razor. It's hard to beat the German quality. However, I believe this razor is not aggressive enough. I actually got a  better shave with my $12.00 Lord. I just don't get that close shave feeling, even after two passes. Maybe I should try a third pass, but I don't think it's going to matter. I've used both Feather and the Gillette 7 O'clock Sharp Edge blades. The new feather worked better this morning. I'll try it for a few days more and see how it goes.
3812028492 I had this razor for 5 years.  Finally, the handle separated from the head of the razor while closing the razor head with the knob at the bottom.  There is a screw head that comes out of the handle, which the razor head attaches by surrounding the screw head with with plating.  I wasn't abusing the razor or over-tightening it.  I was hoping to get more \"bang for the buck\" out of this razor.  I think the longer handle of this razor enables more force, while closing the razor.Since then, I've purchased the 34C (shorter handle).  I dropped the razor in the shower and, again, the head separated from the handle.  Is this a common design for plated DE razors?  Is it the chrome plating that's susceptible to this?  I don't know.I also found the spiral lines on the handle didn't help get a firm grip on the razor.  My hands are occasionally soapy in the shower (surprise!) and every once in a while it would get away from me.  I don't find this to be an issue with the 34C's different design.The Merkur 38C is lackluster and I'll be looking at other non-Merkur razors for my next purchase.
3812028492 My first safety razor, and I'll probably never have to buy another.My list of Amazon-acquired shaving supplies:Deluxe Stainless Steel Safety Razor and Shaving Brush Stand from Super Safety RazorsMerkur Classic Barbor Pole Long Handle Safety Razor #38 + 10 Free DE Razor BladesTruefitt & Hill Ultimate Comfort Pre-Shave Oil, 2 oz.Truefitt & Hill 1805 Aftershave BalmTweezerman  Men's Shaving BrushTruefitt & Hill 1805 Shave Cream JarOsma Styptic Pencil, Hemo StopFeather Hi-Stainless Platinum Double Edge Razor Blades 30 Ct100 Astra Superior Premium Platinum Double Edge Razor Blades
3812028492 I made the jump to a safety razor because of the cost of disposable cartridges, but also because I thought i would enjoy to ritual of shaving this way.  All I can say is good choice by me!  It absolutely takes some getting used to (buy a Dabon by Pinaud styptic pencil at the same time) but once you get a handle on it you won't regret the switch.  This type of shaving produces a closer shave than i ever got with the most expensive multi-blade cartridges and now I'm down to one or two nicks a week, mostly because I forget to take my time.  Start out angling the razor by raising your wrist in order to avoid slicing yourself up and as you get used to it gradually lower the wrist and you'll see the true effectiveness of the razor.  This particular model has plenty of heft.  It looks and feels like the quality tool that it is.  Get yourself a badger hair bursh and some Taylor of Bond Street shaving cream, crank up the hot water and enjoy the gentlemanly ritual of a quality shave.  Pick up some after shave cream in order to soothe your skin because if you've been shaving with cartridges your face won't be used to the closeness of this shave.  Also, keep a few cartridges around for those mornings when you're running late.  Rush through a shave with this (or any other safety razor) and you'll pay the price.
3812028492 Being an extra large (and then some) person, I elected to get a razor with a bigger heavier handle, and this delivers.  Growing up appreciating German quality, I also found that to be appealing (it kinda delivers there).  All in all I'm happy, though not ecstatic about the purchase.Pros:Big and heavy as advertisedWell built at a functional levelLess aggressive head is forgiving for novicesIncludes 1 bladeCons:May be too big and heavy for someDetails are a bit rough for $50More advanced users may want to upgrade to a more aggressive head (if needed)Could include at least a 10 pack of blades for the priceI don't regret my purchase, though my next purchase likely would be a different model.  It's very forgiving for my novice skills, and that's a huge plus, but one that I'll outgrow (I hope!).  I really wish the details on the finish would wow me with craftsmanship, and it doesn't.  It's just average, and honestly less than I'd expect for $50.
3812028492 This is my first safety Razor.  it's worked very well so far.  It has a great weight to it and feels good in your hand.  It took me a long time to convince myself to spend $50+ on a razor, but it has been a good one so far.  The long handle is better for my because I have bear paws...
3812028492 Awesome razor. Went to this from a Mach 5 blade. SOOOO Much happier with this then any disposable blade I have ever used. The shave is incredibly close and smooth. The weight of the blade feels nice in you hand. Replacement blades are less then $0.50 each and last just as long as the disposables. Plus it's manly. Can't recommend enough.
7884890364 Needed this for a desk clock. They work great. Very good price as compared to the local store. I would buy these again.
7884890364 I had a lot of trouble deciding which batteries to order, but I'm happy with these.  I've only used a few, but they've lasted for months of regular use now (laser pointer) and there have been no issues with leaking or anything else.  Although these weren't the cheapest, I'm glad I ordered these as I've had no problems and they seem to work well.
7884890364 Just what we expect them to be. We have a door chimethat uses three of these at a time, and they last several months (like 8 to 10 months)before needing to be replaced, so that seems reasonable.
7884890364 Got mine from Photoland NY and they're just fine.If you're planning on using these in a vintage film camera, you might be better off with SR44 type silver oxide batteries, as they maintain more of a constant voltage over their lifespan. Especially if your camera does not have a regulation circuit.
7884890364 Bought the batteries for remote car alarm. Works perfectly and seem to have plenty of juice to power the remotes.
7884890364 ONE STAR:The Maxell LR44 10-pack photo shows the new hologram packaging, but I received the old orange & black packaging.The batteries are stale. Lights powered by them are semi-bright, and only last a day or so.The orange & black pack rates 1-star.FIVE STARS:From the same supplier, MyBatterySupplier, I ordered the50-pack, which did come in the new hologram package, and the difference was dramatic.  Lights powered by the batteries were brilliant, and I expect them to last much longer.The new hologram pack rates 5-stars.
7884890364 Cheap batteries that did the job. They replaced older LR 44's just fine. Time will tell if how long they last but the first 4 worked without issues. So much cheaper than at the local stores.
7884890364 These did not work at all - absent of enough power to work.  these were cheap - waste of money
7884890364 I need these batteries for light timers.  I have three timers and each takes two batteries. The price of these batteries at the local drug store is far more.  ( FAR MORE ! )  Buying these saved me a bundle.  They were also delivered pretty fast.  I am impressed.
7884890364 No issues, these batteries work great.  I find that a lot of kids electrinics use these batteries.  The 10 pack was cheaper than buying one 1 from the store.
7884890364 My cat loves chasing a red laser light - but the batteries had become weak.  I checked the price of a new one, but found that I can change the batteries out - and  have seven left over (all for $2.00) - I'd call that a bargain!
7884890364 Received these in just a few days. It took a little longer than expected, because I'm so spoiled by Amazon's  usual quicker-than-quick deliveries, but it was during the Christmas holiday shipping frenzy. Wish there was an expiration date printed on the pkg., but I just wrote the date I received them on the back. I usually mark them with the date I install them in the device anyway.
7884890364 This is exactly what I needed for my clock.  Between price and the product, it is excellent and does the job.
7884890364 Would you rather pay 3 to 4 times the price for these same batteries at Walmart or Target?  They last for years and keep their charge.
7884890364 These are perfect batteries for small electronic games such as the older ones that were around before all the fancy Game Boys and things came out. Most of them take two of these batteries so this pack has five sets of batteries if you use them for that purpose.
7884890364 I mean...that's it. They're button batteries, this is a good price, they are a decent brand and they work. Yay.
7884890364 It works great.  Do not hesitate to buy it and is much cheaper than store brands.
7884890364 This is a great price for batteries, you could pay a couple of bucks a retail store for only 1 or 2 when you can get 10 on Amazon!  These little LR44's are found in so many of my children's toys, the Thomas the Tank Engine cars that talk, Tinkerbell that glows, Christmas ornaments, even some little cheap twirling lights bought at the dollar store.  I have ordered these twice now, because something new dies and I find that it needs the same kind of battery.  It's definitely more economical to buy in this quantity than buying a couple at a time!  They also work well and last, too.  Stock up HERE!!
7884890364 Batteries worked for what i needed them.  Can be used for many  items.
7884890364 Good quality batteries.  I wish Amazon would let me skip reviewing some of the items I have purchased to get them out of the &#34;create a review&#34; list.
7884890364 This is a handy, inexpensive source to replace LR44 batteries which are used in my calculators and other items around the house.
7884890364 it is great to have a supply of this size battery. they are pricey in the stores and not always in stock
7884890364 I never heard of this size until my granddaughter's toy needed 3 of them. What a bargain these were and they worked fine. We have the leftovers saved for the next time!
7884890364 Bought from Photoland NY, all batteries were fresh-- measured with DMM, all checked out at either 1.59V or 1.6V, no duds. Paid a little more from this seller but I got what I paid for and definitely way cheaper than purchasing locally.
7884890364 Nothing to say about it.  They are just batteries, but they are as they look like.  I'm satisfied with them.
7884890364 Great batteries that last about 12-16 months in a watch.  Much less expensive than retail.  Fast arrival too. Well done.
7884890364 These Alkaline batteries are certainly inexpensive.  They're OK for light duty devices that take multiple cells to keep the refresh cost low.  More expensive Silver Oxide batteries will probably last longer, but at a higher cost.  Note the seller shipped the batteries in the older packaging, not the new packaging pictured in the ad that I expected.  Hopefully they are not very old stock.
7884890364 These batteries are great, they last a long time and are super cheap, not much more to it than that!
7884890364 so cheap and durable, shipped really fast to me and i have enough to do all my watches and a friends too
7884890364 Bought 3 packs, prepared to live with a high percentage of bad ones considering that locally the same batteries are $3 each, but they are easy to check in the card and all were good.  Bought these in 2011 just used the last ones and came back to order more when I realized I hadn't reviewed them.  Very pleased.BTW, it is true that the description is misleading, the batteries I received are alkaline, not silver-oxide.  I will use only silver oxide in timekeeping devices, but for toys and flashlights, alkaline is a better value.
7884890364 I use quite a few of these. These arrived quickly at a good price. I'll be back for more when these are gone.
7884890364 they worked for my daughters toy microphone thing and then after we got it working, I thought perhaps I shouldn't have bought the batteries to get it to work b/c it plays the same song over and over again!! haha
7884890364 I got these for my Girlfriend Christmas Ornaments and now we are all happy now that they can play like last year.
B00000J47L This was a great purchase at a nice price. If I knew how good they were I probably would have bought more at the time.
B00000J47L No problem.  Well pleased.
B00000J47L These are nice to have so I give them a 4 out of 5. I still have them in a drawer too.
B00000J47L I bought a pack of these a while back from Sam's Club. I used them in my appliance remotes but noticed that they don't hold their charges for long thereby necessitating frequent recharges. The cheap rapid charger 'CH30MN' that came with the battery pack did not help matters either as it heats the batteries up during the charging process to the point of being unbearable to touch.Save your money and buy the newSANYO NEW 1500 eneloop 8 Pack AA Ni-MH Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteriesinstead.
B00000J47L Dont use that often but after a couple years of use so far, they are still charging and working great.
B00000J47L I've been using these for years for my Xbox 360 controllers and various other household items that require AA. These lose their recharge ability after a year or two. Their life becomes a lot shorter after you discharge and recharge them so many times. Overall, they've been more than worth the money I've put into them as I would've spent a LOT more in non-rechargeable AA and AAA's over the same period of time. These are here to stay for me.
B00000J47L The batteries are good and they work in my charger (different brand)  They do not last as long as the other brand but they do the job.
B00000J47L As much as I want to be greener, I find that these batteries make me want to buy regular old batteries.  Definitely do your research and stay away from these.
B00000J47L The AAAs I have in my remote controls seem to last a very long time on one or two charges; of course the power-draw of a remote control is minimal. In contrast, I have had many problems with Energizer AAs used in digital cameras. While some of these batteries keep the Energizer Bunny going and going, for no discernible reason, many of them start showing as \"bad\" in the charger (blinking red light) after only a few charges, meaning... pregnant pause... the rabbit died.*Update, 27 FEB 2012* I am still using 4 of these batteries (of the 16 that I bought), and while they continue to limp along, the Rayovac Hybrids that I bought at the same time are by far superior... The Energizers power my camera for only a few hours, whereas the Rayovacs that I bought at the same time are still good for several days of camera use.Day and night. Even if the Energizers were being sold for $.25 each, I don't think I'd go there again.
B00000J47L Very good experience with this brand over the last several years.  Mine are indeed the 2300 mAh variety.  Here's my experience:&#10004; I have a set of 6 of these AA batteries, and I use them all on my day-hikes. When I started hiking, I used the usual alkaline batteries--boy I soon learned that was dumb!  The intelligent thing is to use these types of rechargeables, whether this brand or a comparable brand. (I confess I have not tried the Amazon store brand.)&#10004;  In preparing for a hike, I put 2 in my Garmin E-trex, 2 in my Energizer hi-power flashlight, and 2 in my backpack as spares. My Garmin lasts throughout the entire 9-10 hour hike. Just once that I can recall did they poop-out towards the end of a hike.&#10004; Of course, I am very careful to charge them up the day before.&#10004; So far, I've recharged each one maybe 30 times over 3 years without any trouble.&#10004; Boy, they really get hot when charged up!  This worries me a bit, but I'm careful to unplug the charger in the morning.&#10004; Not really anything to complain about.  We'll see how many times they charge.&#9835; A review by Chris Lawson
B00000J47L I purchased thsee even though it was not clear what the battery rating was. I was pleased to find an extremely high rating of 2500mah, not 1200 as another person got. These batteries work long and hard in my canon digital camera between charges. Charges are fast and easy. Awesome batteries. I will never bother buying regular Energizers again. I have Panasonic 2100's and these Energizer 2500's  and both sets prove stronger and last much longer (even between charges) than regular non-rechargable energizers.
B00000J47L They work well, I've had them now for quite a while but just getting to the review. They still hold a charge fairly well, if I leave them in there for a day or two they will run my xbox controller for about a day or sometimes half the day. But if you want to use them in something like a clock or TV remote, they will easily last more than a month.
B00000J47L Right out of the box and ready to go !Everything here is a 5 star from the packaging to the product.Charged fully --even though I did not  use them immediately.Fits great ..packaged great --opens easy all good on these.
B00000J47L If used most brands out there and in my experience this brand works the best for my applications.
B00000J47L I used rechargable batteries in flashlights, mouses, keyboards, clocks and my battery operated toothbrush. They recharge many times which more than justify the cost.  I will continue to use this product in the future, also.
B00000J47L I've had a set of these batteries for a year or two now. The last few times I've taken them out for vacation use in camera, I've had the same problem: I charge two sets (one Kodak and one these Energizers) when I put the camera away. A few weeks later, I go off on vacation. The Kodak 1600mAh set will last me all day on the charge from a month or so before. The Energizer 2500mAh set might last me half a day, having lost most of its charge from sitting for the same number weeks before use.After missing out on some pics on my latest trip due to dead batteries, I'd had enough. The Energizers are going in the bin, and I just followed the good reviews to buy a set of Duracells to replace them.
B00000J47L I bought these for my digital camera.  I was apprehensive at first because the last Energizer rechargeable batteries I bought didn't hold a charge well.  So far, these are working great.  Hundreds of photos taken after the first charge and they're still going strong.  So far, so good.
B00000J47L In this day and age it is hard to understand why everyone isn't using rechargable batteries.  I own about 6 packs of these batteries.  They are wonderful.  I bet I have saved hundreds of dollars so far and keep saving.  Why pay $4.00 to $5.00 for one pack of batteries that get used once and thrown away when you can purchase these and reuse them 1000 times.  I absolutely refuse to by disposable batteries for the most part.  It is true that they don't quite have the power of normal energizer alkaline batteries so they might be an issue for certain things that use a lot of power.  For example Digital Camera's take a lot of power.  But for the most part these work really well and I have used them for 3 - 4 years now.  I highly recommend them to everyone.
B00000J47L I use my rechargable batteries for just about everything. Be it remote controls, cameras,and flashlights and I haven't noticed any rapid deteriorating of the batteries. Recharging takes about 12 hrs but I keep extra just in case. The only issue I have had is the price - it keeps going up. I've seen them priced as high as $12 for the 4 pack. I have also seen them as low as $7.99 at Menards they average about $9.99. If you decide to use rechargable batteries just make sure you have extra ones for when they run down.
B00000J47L Plain and simple, they do not work. They do not charge. I exchanged them for a second set, and they had the same problem. I will stick with the Duracell rechargables that have worked perfectly for me so far.
B00000J47L Energizer is one of the best brands for rechargeable batteries that I have purchased.  They hold a charge a lot longer than many others.
B00000J47L I purchased 12 of these late last year.  After 4 months of low to medium use, they stopped holding their charge -- even when not placed in a device.  I lost several camera opportunities when I found that all the batteries in my camera bag were dead just days after being charged.I still use them but make sure to drop them in the charger a few hours before they're to be used.  It's better than just throwing them away.  Definitely not \"Great for the environment\" if you end up throwing them away within 6 months. :(
B00000J47L I have mixed feelings about these batteries.  They take a good charge and hold it better than my Duracell rechargebles, but still lose about 10% overnight.  I use them to power a one-LED night light outdoors.  It keeps it bright for at least three nights if I remember to turn it off during the day.  One of the four batteries is a little loosey-goosey.  Sometimes it only charges about 75%, though another recharge cycle will restore it to full again.  Considering other reviewers' comments about funky batteries, maybe they should tighten their quality control.
B00000J47L Ok,We've been using these batteries in our remotes and other devices for years.Unfortunately, Energizer does not maintain consistent mAh ratings on theses batteries.  What does this actually mean?  Well, every battery can provide you a certain amount of energy over a specific time frame (basically: discharge at a specific rate of current).  The rate of discharge is usually in miliamps per hour or mAh.What I've  recently noticed is that we have a TON of Energizer brand NiMH rechargeable batteries, along with the 15 minute charger.  (All of which work VERY well...)However, it turns out the there is a problem:  the batteries are all rated at different current rates:  some are 2450mAh, others are 2200 mAh, and still others are 2500 mAh.Why is this a problem?  Well,  it turns out that you can't mix and match different versions of these batteries in sensitive electronic equipment.So, if you are going to invest in the batteries you need to purchase a bunch of them at once and they really need to be exactly the same mAh rating.Other things to note:  most of the really good batteries are made in Japan.  Some of the recently produced versions are made in China, not Taiwan, but China... And the quality of these may be dubious.  Time will tell...  The biggest issue is something called \"low discharge rate,\" which means the unused NiMH batteries typically made in Japan or Taiwan will hold a charge for years (older, less advanced rechargeables need to be charged every 6 months to a year)Lastly, you need to know that NiMH rechargibles run at 1.2 volts, not 1.5 volts.  So this means that certain electronics may not work properly with lower current / voltage rechargibles.  Typically, this is not an issue... But it IS a problem if you mix two different Energizer AA batteries of different mAh ratings in a device that takes multpe AA batteries.  (I recently ran into this issue with an L3 thermal imager and an older night vision PVS-4 optical scope.  Both work without issue if the batteries are same mAh rating, but fail to work properly when using mixed versions of the Energizer batteries... and the L3 thermal site specifcally indicates it will work with rechargable NiMH batteries!)Moral of the story:Pros:- if you have devices the use tons of batteries,  rechargeables are for you- the 15 minute energizer charger actually works very well- you can get sleeves that allow you to use the AA batteries in devices using C or D type battery devices... (Enerloop comes to mind) and this will work with medium power requirement C and D devices- after the initial investment, you start saving a lot of moneyCons:- if you have devices that really need 1.5 volt batteries, NiMH can be a problem ( for those things, go and purchase Lithium AA batteries... They work very well in most of the high power requiring devices I've played with... But so have the Japaese made 2450mAh NiMH Energizer rechargables.- you really need to pay strict attention to batches of Energizer batteries you have, if they are all over the place went you read the little green tag on the that says \" 2450mAh,\" \"2200mAh,\" or \"2500mAh,\" you will have problems with them. If you keep like versions together you will not run into the issues that other people have: premature failure of their energizer batteries, as opposed to years of great service!
B00000J47L I've used Energizer rechargeables almost exclusively until I realized there were better, if maybe not as well-known, brands on the market.  I've used Energizer to power my keyboard, mouse, camera, and Zoom H2.  They usually work fine for a few charges, but then they give out and don't hold a charge for longer than an hour in the H2.  I recently switched to eneloop batteries and am much happier.
B00000J47L Usually my rechargeable batteries last longer the year before I need to buy a new set. Not this time. Maybe I just got a bad batch
B00000J47L These are batteries. If you have ever seen batteries before then you know what Im talking about. Dont be surprised when you open this package and you see batteries. Thats exactly what they are.Works perfect in my two different battery chargers, and Energizer always keeps a long life!
B00000J47L Love them . . . They last a very long while and I use them to power my professional flashes . . . some say they dont the same amount of power as regular non-rechargable batteries and I agree . . . they have waaaay more! I have used reg batteries in a pinch and can not even go an hour and my light output is very inconsistant. . . but depending on my location I can shoot with these an entire reception with one set :) LOVE THEM!!
B00000J47L At 2500ah, these rechargeable NiMh batteries provide more power fully charged that regular alkalines.  My bicycle headlight shines brighter when I use these.  In my digital camera it makes it able to shoot 3 frames per second.  Get the Sony charger to go with these.  They will last a long time.  I am sold on NiMh rechargeable batteries!
B00000J47L I just gave up and threw out these batteries, after only a couple of months. I had them in rotation (with two other sets of rechargeables-- Duracell and Sanyo) in my digital camera. In the beginning, they were fine and comparable to the other brands. Now they don't even last one day in my camera. Sometimes I get only a handful of pictures in before they die. I don't have that kind of patience... I won't buy Energizer rechargeables again.
B00000J47L I have 4 kids and we were using batteries like crazy.  I don't necessarily like throwing all of those batteries away when there are rechargables.  I went to the store without doing any research first and just picked up these Energizers 2500mAhs.  Needless to say, most don't work after a year.  I couldn't get my programmable thermastat to even work because it had such a low charge coming straight off of the charger.  And today, my sons batteries died in his guitar, took the ones that had just gotten done in the charger and they didn't even last five minutes, and boy he wasn't very happy.  I think I would have been better off getting those junky ones from the dollar store.  Look for a better brand!
B00000J47L If the original Energizer AA alkaline battery is The Bunny, a digital camera is a hungry wolverine, devouring 2 or 4 of them li'l guys at a time and spitting out an empty shell after just 20 to 50 pictures. Makes you wonder why every digital camera doesn't have a big sticker on the box screaming \"FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, USE NiMH RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES!!\"The latest generation of Energizer Rechargeable batteries will outrun Energizer alkaline and lithium by miles, and come back for more after a trip to the recharger. They'll keep your digital camera fat and happy on a single charge provided you let them \"cook\" for at least 24 hours on the first charge. After that, use 'em as little or as much as you want and store them in the charger between uses.As a \"thrash\" test, I charged a pair for 24 hours, removed them from the charger for another 24 hours and installed them in a Vivitar ViviCam 3746 3.1 megapixel digital camera. After taking over 100 pictures with both the flash and the LCD display switched on, the battery meter never dipped to the \"time to recharge\" mark. Remember, NiMH batteries aren't like those old NiCd batteries from way back in the 1990s. You never have to \"drain\" them regularly nor do you have to take them out of the charger to prevent overcharging.The recloseable package provides a handy pocket pack for carrying a spare pair (if your digital camera uses 2 batteries), so the smartest way to use them is to buy 2 4-packs. Leave one set in the charger and take the other set when you head out for a day trip. On vacations, take along the charger and both sets of batteries. They don't take up that much room and you'll never have to buy an overpriced stale battery from a hotel gift shop.
B00000J47L Great Value, I got the 4AA batteries and an Energizer AA and AAA charger... The Charger is portable and easy to read with a big red light telling me not ready and a big glowing green light when all batteries are charged, can charge both AA and AAA at the same time...
B00000J47L I have two digital cameras and they both use AA batteries.  Energizer batteries are one of the best.  Hold their charge and when they do need to be charged they are ready to go again.  Recommend.
B00000J47L Compared to older mode rechargeable batteries these held a charge (unused in a drawer) beautifully compared to my dead unused rechargeable batteries that weren't being used either.
B00000J47L Nice and affordable.  You can't go wrong with these batteries.  For me, there is nothing else to say here.  Great buy.
B00000J47L A great price for a multi-pack of rechargable batteries.  They work very well.  I bought these to have on hand because they work so much better than the throw away kind
B00000J47L I've found these to hold a charge for quite some time.  I keep extras on hand, in the charger, so that when the ones being used give out I can easily swap.  They do lose their charge over time though (like all rechargeables) so don't put them in your camera and expect to take many pictures a month later.  For items that you use infrequently I would stick with the non-rechargeables.
B00000J47L At first these are fantastic. Strong, good charge.  But after about 20-maybe 30 if that recharges, some of my batteries just dead. Or do not hold charge for more than a night.  It is reall bad.  I bought about 5 or 6 (4 packs) of these, more than half of it are useless.
B00000J47L I love these rechargeable batteries. They save a lot of money over the throw away batteries. They keep their charge for a long time, eve if you don't charge them and use them immediately.
B00000J47L This product is advertised as the NEW Energizer Rechargeable NiMH AA Batteries. But once you received it, you may be shocked to find out that: the rated capacity of those NEW batteries is just '2300mAh', lower than the previous generation of '2500mAh' Energizer NiMH cells. So are you really getting a new and improved product, or just some old inventory from many years ago?The fact is, Energizer has discontinued the '2500mAh' series of rechargeable AA NiMH cells, presumably due to massive complaints about rapid-self-discharge problem. All new Energizer rechargeable AA cells on the market now are rated '2300mAh'.I have tested four of those new cells, using the Discharge/Refresh function of myLa Crosse BC-900charger/analyzer. Here are my findings:- Fresh out of the package, those cells hold an average of 330mAh, or just 14% of the full capacity.- After fully charging them for the first time, they hold an average of 1040mAh.- After two more discharge/charge cycles, the average capacity improved to 2340mAhBased on the above observations, I can conclude that those 'New' Energizer cells are just ordinary NiMH cells with lower capacity. They are not the LSD (low-self-discharge) type pioneered bySANYO eneloop. This is very disappointing, because other name-brand battery makers have already introduced LSD products similar to eneloop, such as theRayovac HybridandDuracell Pre Charged. In contrast, the Energizer Bunny simply 'rolled back' its battery technology to circa 2004.The only positive thing I can say about those 2300mAh Energizer cells is: they _probably_ don't self-discharge as badly as previous generation of 2500mAh cells.In summary, those so-called 'New' Energizer NiMH cells have capacity just slightly higher than LSD NiMH cells (2000-2100mAh), yet do not offer the advantage of lower self discharge rate. As of this writing, this product is priced at nearly 2x higher than LSD cells. So it is just a bad deal.
B00000J47L this product is exactly what i wanted rechargeable batteries plain and simple.  they last a descent amount of time and the re charge is a reasonably. id buy again.
B00000J47L I originally got this for my daughter's leapfrog leap pad. She was going through batteries every couple of days, so rather than go broke buying batteries, I got these along with theEnergizer Value Charger with AA Rechargeable Batteries, 4 Batteries Included, which gives us a set to put in her leap pad, and a set to keep on the charger charged.  It charges well, and is always ready when I need to swap them out. It is definite woth the money, especially if you go through a lot of batteries.
B00000J47L I was going through quite a few batteries for my cats' toys: there's a chase-the-string toy, a chase-the-mouse-tail toy, and a whoo-hoo!-chase-the-laser dot toy.  Using the rechargeable batteries works well - I have an Energizer charger and two sets of 4 AAs to rotate, so they've always got something ready to pounce on!  I'm saving money and not throwing away so many batteries, and the cats don't notice the difference!
B00000J47L As many other reviewers have pointed out, these batteries have a very high self-discharge rate.  This means that within a short period of time (for me about 7-10 days) they will be completely dead even if you completely charged them and never used them.  The only reason I didn't give these batteries 1 star is because they do work well right out of the charger.  But you pretty much have to use them within 2-3 days of charging.  Wait any longer and it will already be significantly discharged.  I  know I didn't just get a bad batch either because I have a couple dozen of these Energizers which I purchased over the course of 2+ years.  I didn't notice the discharge rate at first because I used to charge my batteries pretty frequently to make sure I always had a fresh set in whatever device I was using.  But eventually I started noticing that even my \"freshly charged\" batteries weren't lasting very long.  So I started paying closer attention to how frequently I charged my batteries and realized that even after a week they would be mostly or completely dead.I've switched over to Rayovac Hybrids and Sanyo Eneloops which both have a much lower self-discharge.  I've very happy with both of them and would definitely recommend either of them over these Energizers.  I hope that Energizer eventually comes out with some low self-discharge batteries because I really like their other batteries.  But avoid the rechargeables.  They're just not worth it.
B00000J47L I took 83 digital pics, plus 14 minutes of QuickTime movies, plus about 90 minutes of camera idle time, and they were still at 50%!
B00000J47L I used NiCD batteries for a time years ago and gave up on those. When I tried the NiMH batteries I started with these ones and was very disappointed with the technology, we used it in a mouse that required about twice a week changes, later I changed to Sanyo's eneloop and I'm very happy.
B00000J47L These Energizer Rechargeable batteries are very good for people that use items which are generally considered to be battery hogs.These work well in Remote Control toys (such as RC Helicopters or for video game remotes like the Wii). They charge quickly (time varies depending on the charger and the power level when charging begins, but most charge within two hours for me). The only downside is that they seem to lose some power when not in use. This is ok for me, because I just know that I need to charge them up the day before I want to use them, but if you think you can buy these to charge them and then let them sit on a shelf for a month before using, then you will be disappointed.I don't use these in the TV remote, and I don't use them for clocks. But they are a great buy for many applications (including digital cameras, if you have one that runs on AA).Overall, these have saved me money, and allowed me to use battery powered items in ways that I wouldn't have used them had I had to pay for disposable batteries.
B00000J47L These batteries were bought as a gift for our great grand children's toys. They can recharge batteries without having to wait for more batteries and save a lot of expense for the parents, too.
B00000J47L Avoid these batteries!!!!!!  My experience is similar to many others.  Good initial performance, and then these bloody Energizer batteries can't hold a charge.  Unfortunately before I discovered how crappy they really are, I bought a bunch of them, for use in my digital cameras and camera flash units.  When these babies fail, performance falls like a lead balloon.  They might have enough power to operate a remote control unit, but you can forget about powering anything with a major power draw.Unfortunately Energizer is extremely successful at getting stores to stock this junk.  I get real annoyed whenever I see them on display, because it reminds me of all the money I wasted.  They seem to be available everywhere, a constant reminder of a disaster.  How does a product that is so bad, get such great distribution and remain available for sale?  Energizer probably gets off easy, because it takes a while for their batteries to go bad.  By then, it's less likely that people will complain or return them.  Blasting them here is like therapy for me.As an alternative, I strongly recommend Ray-O-Vac Hybrid cells, which have worked very well for me so far.
B00000J47L I have been using Energizer NiMh batteries for years.  I recently purchased these because they have a higher power rating (2500mAh) as opposed to my older batteries (1800mAh). I primarily use the AA batteries to power wireless controllers for video game consoles.  Their performance varies depending on the controller I use them in, 
B00000J47L While these batteries have a higher mAh rating than other brands, I've seen much better performance from my Duracell and even some generic rechargeable batteries.  I cannot say for certain you'll have the same bad experience, as it depends what you use them for, but for me they barely seem to make it 2-3 months and sometimes only weeks before they lose too much charge to be of use.  They're nearly worthless to me.  I almost never use them anymore.I'm replacing these with Duracell ones that are advertised to hold their charge for a year, so hopefully those will work as promised.  I just cannot advise going with Energizer after using these.  Try another brand.
B00000J47L I'm a die hard geocacher - and the best AA batteries I can find for long life are the Energizer Lithium 9x batteries, but they are expensive and it bothers me to dispose of so many batteries (even recycled) in a year.  SO, I bought two sets of these and a charger and they work well.  Not great, but well.  I have to change batters in the outdoor GPS twice for a full day of caching whereas I could go all day on the Lithium 9x ones.  Sort of an inconvenience, but going green on anything seems to have it's convenience price tag...Good batteries.  Have the Rayovac rechargeable AA's as well and these seem to be a LITTLE longer lasting on a full charge.
B00000J9DU It ran good and I liked the different attachments, but I gave it away because I was uncomfortable with not having a lid like my previous one did.
B00000J9DU I loathe flossing. So sue me.But don't convict me of gingivitis. This Water Jet has removed all the little \"sore spots\" that I was concerned about - they show up as places where the bubbles collect if you gargle with half-strength hydrogen peroxide - with two uses. That's a single day's usage. You bet I'm going to be using it twice daily from now on!Thanks, Interplak!
B00000J9DU The device comes with 4 different tips.  One of these has a small opening.  I bet that many of the people who find this device too weak are using that particular tip by bad luck.The Interplak is not as strong as a WaterPik.  But in my experience it lasts about five times as long, and is much cheaper.
B00000J9DU I bought two of these a couple of years ago so I would have a replacement when the first one broke.  Guess what?  I haven't had to get out the second one yet.  The first one is working and I use it every day.  Stay away from the Waterpik and get the Interplak.
B00000J9DU My wife, a dental hygenist, brought home a couple of these, one for us and one for her sister's family.  Everyone likes it.  I then bought another from Amazon (for cheaper than she got it from her office) for her sister's young son, who likes it a lot, but wanted one of his own.We've had ours for close to a year, and we use it every day, usually twice each.
B00000J9DU It was helpful reading the other reviews, I had to be patient and change the pressure (1 to 7) quite a few more times than the instructions stated. Once I got pressure, it has worked great since, I have used the product for 3 months, 3 times a day. It works so well I have purchased 3 others for relatives.
B00000J9DU I bought this as a replacement for a Water Pik flosser and so far I like it.  I like how easy it is to take apart. It is a bit louder than my old water pik but the pressure is fine and I like all of the attachments.  Good buy!
B00000J9DU I had this Interplak until for just over 1 year and it just stopped working for no apparent reason. The pump runs but no water flows. I checked the water path and it's completely clear. No blockages anywhere. The pump simply doesn't pump water anymore. I wouldn't get another because even when it did work the water jet was underpowered. The WaterPik brand has a more robust stream and is more effective. As other reviewers have pointed out, the pressure dial on the Interplak can be almost impossible to turn. There is a large array of attachments will for most people will simply be a cleaning nightmare since they'll never use them. So they just sit on top of the unit collecting dirt. Overall I'd rate this unit as \"build quality: poor, life span: short, effectiveness: disappointing\".
B00000J9DU I recommend this product but if you dont have lots of bathroom counter space like me, it ends up in the cabinet and I dont use it like I should.  I should have purchased something smaller but this is a good product
B00000JHQ2 Never once have I received a &#34;dud&#34; from duracell batteries no matter the size. They work the first time, every time, and for a very long time after that.  I highly recommend Duracell batteries.  Period.
B00000JHQ2 I use these batteries every time I turn around. I truster Duracell, The Coppertop batteries. I am well-stocked for all of my remotes
B00000JHQ2 They batteries worked great, and it was handy to get them in the mail. I don't live near a store, so I appreciate having this item come in the mail.
B00000JHQ2 Batteries....hmmm, what can I say about them?  Well, they saved my life.  One of the batteries took a bullet for me back in Nom!  They are AAA batteries.
B00000JHQ2 I love the brand but the batteries are not that strong. I placed some of them in my TV remote control and they were still going kind of slow.
B00000JHQ6 The batteries I received were knock offs.I am not sure if all of the sellers who sell these batteries are selling knock offs. The ones I bought were. Some of my wireless electronics did not recognize the batteries.
B00000JHQ6 with 3 little ones we use lots of batteries.. these are cheap and shipped free to my house.. cant get any better than that
B00000JHQ6 They are 9 Volt batteries and they work! You can use them to shock little children or something more productive like keeping your family a little safer from smoke/fire/carbon monoxide.....your choice.
B00000JHQ6 Duracell produces top notch batteries that last longer than any others on the market.  My husband wouldn't consider buying anything else.
B00000JHQ6 We continually order batteries and Duracell is usually out choice.  They are long lasting and reasonably priced.  I would recommend these batteries.
B00000JHQ6 I've had nothing but good luck with Duracell batteries.  The radio I installed these in is going strong, several months later.
B00000JHQ6 Super battery for the automatic lid opener garbage can. No problems and we're still using the first two batteries after 5 months.
B00000JHQ6 I had flashlights that needed batteries. Now I am prepared for emergencies and everyday use to look at my outdoor thermostat.
B00000JHQ6 The ad shows batteries in a package, I got batteries that were shrink wrapped and no open to leave seller feedback. I just got a bunch of loose batteries. I don't know if they are real Duracell or not.
B00000JHQ6 Typical great quality C batteries you would expect from Duracell. I would obviously buy these again if i needed them !
B00000JHQ6 Worth the money and last just as long as can be expected.I have had 4 batteries in two smoke detectors for one year and they still work as directed.
B00000JHQ6 Duracell coppertops are good batteries.  The price was better than I could get at the local stores.  I will certainly buy again.
B00000JHQ6 Arrived promptly and they do what they're supposed to do. I've not had any experience with a failure in any of the batteries I've purchased online.
B00000JHQ6 These are, of course, the well known Duracell Coppertop batteries. What's not to like? The shipping was fairly quick, and the batteries arrived as pictured.
B00000JHQ6 Duracell 9 volts are the only batteries I use in the wireless microphones we use for our instructional video business. We replace the batteries before every shoot and sometime run for up to 10 hours non-stop. Wireless microphones use a lot of power and we have found that the Duracell batteries can make it through an entire day of shooting, lasting about 25% longer than the less expensive generic types we tried before.We also use Duracell 9 volts in our smoke detectors at home. They might be more expensive than some, but they are worth it in the long run.Highly recommended!
B00000JHQ6 Although I'm sure my local fire department will cringe if they read this, I buy these things for our backups for our fire alarms and they last over 4 years!  Wow!  Now if I buy a knockoff brand, or even Energizer, I can only get 18 months out of them before they start squealing to be replaced.  Plus, this 8 battery pack makes it awfully simple to have them around when it comes time to change them, and it's the right number for my house.  Love these Duracells!  Highly, highly recommend!
B00000JHQ6 product was what I wanted and they seem to work great.  Sometimes you get batteries that are 'old', and these have worked great - no issues with them at all.
B00000JHQ6 We use these batteries for our timer candles.  Duracell always lasts the longest and the purchase from Amazon was the best buy.
B00000JHQ6 For me, I use the Duracell Coppertop 9-V Alkaline Batteries for two purposes:1) In a older portable FM/AM radio that accepts a 9 volt battery.2) My three smoke alarms.Before I discovered the Duracell 9 volt batteries, I used a store brand (generic) and sometimes other name brands. All of the generic or cheaper brands did not last long.1) Older Generic - In my smoke alarms - they ran out of juice in just 6 months as I discovered when the smoke alarm beeped in the middle of the night.2) Radio - The generic and cheap brand lasted about one year, but no more.BELOW IS WHAT IS HAVE RECEIVED WHEN I USE THE DURACELL 9 VOLT:1) Smoke Alarms - So now I get at least two to three years!2) Radio - I still have the Duracell battery in my radio and it is still strong. I placed it into the radio in 2008 so it has been in there for FIVE YEARS. Note, this radio I play when the power is off and bring for emergencies etc.Highly recommend these Duracell Batteries.
B00000JHQ6 When it comes to safety and batteries in my flashlights, I've come to trust only Duracell batteries. I recently purchased an LED MagLite, and these batteries are the perfect pairing for it. If you're one of those individuals that uses off-brand batteries, thinking they're just as good, give these a try, and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised with the difference.
B00000JHQ6 As Hurricane Irene advanced on our city and batteries were in low supply, I ordered these batteries on Amazon Prime and had them in two days, just in time for the storm.  Thankfully, I did not need to use them.  I really enjoy my Prime membership and two day free shipping.
B00000JHQ6 I ran out of D cell batteries and needed some for things in the house.  I have found that these batteries last longer than any other brand on the market.  Bulk buying is the way to go.
B00000JHQ6 won't put any other batteries in my flameless candles an I have about 30!!  great lasting power.  go get some.
B00000JHQ6 These batteries were life savers for all the lights and products used during the Christmas season.  They also lasted throughout the entire season.  Excellent buy
B00000JHQ6 You want a battery that is going to last, then you can't go wrong with this one. I bought the 8 count because my garbage can needs 4 and the shelf life of these batteries is so good that I have no doubt it will provide me with the many months of use. Since I have the first 4 still being used, going on 7 months now, I am going to guess at least 1 year before I will need to replace so yes, a good purchase price for this 8 pack.
B00000JHQ6 For most people, that's what you will need these for.  And once that stupid thing starts beeping at 3 AM (I swear its programmed in that way by some sadist at Big Smoke Detector), you are going to want to have a 9 volt ready.  Because you are not the kind of monster who would let your family burn to death (well probably smoke to death if we are honest) cause you were too cheap or lazy to replace the battery.  That's not how you want to get on the local news (that or &#34;local cat hoarder in Guinness Book of World Records&#34;).Given that these have the &#34;Durablock&#34; feature they have a long guaranteed shelf life, so feel free to splurge on this 4 pack of 9 volts.  You will be safe, and feel like a big spender.
B00000JHQ6 Of all the batteries I use, I really dislike D size. They're heavy, and I understand that they have to be. So the question was, do I want to spend a small fortune on rechargeable D's or get the tried an true Duracell D. You know the answer. I use these in one huge flashlight and in two motion sensor lights on our house. I can't tell you that these are better than the bunny batteries, but from my experience, these just keep going, and going, and going. Since the motion sensors are used on a nightly basis (the sensors have picked up raccoons, skunks, and opossums which we didn't even know we had in suburbia), I think it's amazing that we haven't had to replace the batteries yet, and the light is still as strong as ever.
B00000JHQ6 It's hard to say more than what is in the title of this review.  These are Duracell batteries - high quality and delivered on time.
B00000JHQ6 But the Quality of the Copper battery is evident. These last about 10 years (so I am told) but again, to get them by mail is awesome.
B00000JHQ6 I keep batteries in stock at our home.  It started when grandkids needed batteries for their toys.  Now it is convenient because we are in the country and who knows when the power will go out.  I have many candles that are flameless and operate on batteries. Makes life pleasant to not run out.
B00000JHQ6 The Lantern I ordered takes 8 batteries so having this 10-count is great with 2 extra for flash light. I would recommend
B00000JHQ6 These batteries came quickly and were exactly what I ordered. This line of batteries is a lot more in a brick and mortar store.  I like the savings.
B00000JHQ6 Batteries worked fine.  More importantly, the date codes were several years out, so they have a decent shelf life.  Would purchase these batteries again.
B00000JHQ6 I really like these. I used these for my mouse and they have lasted a lot longer than regular batteries do.
B00000JHQ6 I've used Duracell batteries for years, and they've always been reliable. I would like to mention two things that stood out with the most recent D-cell Duracells (8-count package) that I bought in the 8-pack:* The expiration date is December 2023, more than ten years after I purchased them.* The packaging is some of the best that I've seen for batteries, and if you don't need all eight of them now, the packaging also serves as a nice, resealable container. Also, it was extremely easy to open, needing only a small pair of scissors to cut where indicated.I also recently purchased an 8-count package of Duracell C-cells. The same comments apply, except that the packaging is different (cardboard instead of plastic) than the packaging the D-cells came in, and the expiration date is only nine years out.Call me a very satisfied customer.
B00000JHQ6 Best Deals sells outdated batteries. All the batteries had an expiration date of 09/2011 on them. Also they were not in Duracell packaging as the website picture shows. Makes one wonder if they bought a huge bunch of outdated batteries and are now trying to rip off buyers. Best Deals has a history of doing this if you read back in feedback on this company. Whish I had read back and I wouldn't have ordered from them. They also never replied to my emails.  I filed an A-Z guarantee claim with Amazon.  Amazon has also referred this seller to their investigation unit. It is a shame a seller like this tarnishes the excellant reputation Amazon has. No wonder the batteries were so cheap.
B00000JHQ6 Batteries...they work, they last as expected, no worries, no high praise, good product, safe buy...looked specifically for \"coppertop\" not disappointed bought for pool vacuum . Thanks
B00000JHQ6 These were described as guaranteed for 5 years, but have an expiration date that is only 3 years (Mar 2016).  Since I am using them for battery back-up in clocks this is a real bummer.  Not what I expect from Amazon.  Will probably live with it rather than mess with a return.
B00000JHQ6 Some batteries lose their power fast when placed in a fan, but not in used.
B00000JHQ6 I don't usually write reviews of common household products but I am so impressed with these D batteries that I just had to.  I bought these batteries to use use with three motion sensing security lightsMr. Beams MB333 Wireless LED Spotlight with Motion Sensor and Photocell, White, 3-Pack.  Amazon must have had them in our local warehouse since I received both the batteries and lights the next day rather than the usual Prime two days.One of my concerns with the battery operated lights was the hassle of constantly changing the batteries.  Although two of the three are on the  sides of the house in front and won't be tripped very often, one is in back and is constantly being tripped by the dogs. Since we put these up at the beginning of October there have been many dark hours and three dogs are constantly tripping it.I read a couple of studies that said a Duracell D battery will only keep a flashlight going for fifteen hours.  Even if our security light is only on for a total of ten minutes a day (in actuality it is more like fifteen or twenty), I was resigned to having to change the battery at least every three months if not more often, expecially in winter. We are now into the fifth month and as of this morning, it is still going strong.Based on my experience I am going to stick with the Duracell brand for outdoor applications.
B00000JHQ6 Duracell is always my first choice. They always seem to have a great non use time to them. I only use Duracell and have never regretted it since my hot wheels days
B00000JHQ6 This is just a battery right? (Duracell Coppertop with Duralock)The D cells I received from Amazon have a expiration date on the battery Dec 2022. Bought these Dec 2012, so I get 10years. See photo in customer photo section.Great to see expiration date on battery!!  NO MORE GUESSING if they're too old.My D cells came in a plastic box suitable for storage.Price here on Amazon for 8 D cell was much lower than any retail outlet.Good price, fresh batteries. 5 starsShips from and Sold by Amazon
B00000JHQ6 Some mornings I have a rough time getting out of bed.  I keep one of these on my night stand and give it a quick lick to jump-start my day.  Even after a few weeks, it still packs a punch and gets me going!Not really... but I'm sure it would.  It's a battery.  It powers things like a battery should.  What more do you want from it?
B00000JHQ6 Duracell batteries are my favorite for reliability and endurance.  In my opinion, they provide more continuous output than any other competitor battery. The chief competitor, Energizer, does not last as long in my appliances than does the Duracell.  So, when I buy batteries, I buy Duracell.  This said, be aware of the following facts:  Duracell's cost slightly more than Energizers, so perhaps the Energizers are more economical in the long-run.  Second, always check the expiration date on the batteries.  If the expiration date is near, return them and ask for the package with the  longest expiration date.  Finally, store batteries in the refrigerator for longest storage life.  Shelf life at room temperature depletes all batteries.kone
B00000JHQ6 duracell batteries are the best, i use these in outside motion lights and they last a long time. would recommend
B00000JHQ6 As always, Duracell makes great batteries that always do a great job.  I highly recommend Duracell batteries in any size.
B00000JHQ6 Needed to purchase these to power a portable fan. Came well packaged with no damage (from Amazon proper) and the expiration date was years in advance.  Batteries performed as expected, pricing a bit more than 3 hours of continuous power to a portable fan set on &#8220;high&#8221;......  Basically, these are very expensive to use and other types of batteries (re: rechargeable) would be a better purchase although there are just times when only a &#8220;D&#8221; Cell will do.As long as there is no visible damage and your exp. date is ok, these Duracell Alkaline Coppertops should perform well. I have never had any trouble with them over the years.
B00000JHQ6 Duracell makes a great battery; and the \"CopperTop\" version of these 9-volt size batteries does indeed last longer than pervious types of 9-volt batteries by Duracell. These batteries always last a good long time after I install them in a smoke alarm I have.Of course, these 9-volt batteries can be used in anything that requires them--not just smoke alarms. Moreover, the reclosable storage pack actually does close neat and clean for you so that the batteries remaining inside the package don't get dusty or exposure to any elements if you're outside camping or something.Use these batteries before their expiration date. The expiration date will always be several years into the future; but some people still have them lying around in a dresser drawer anyway. The problem is not only do they lose their potency; the batteries also begin to corrode.Do NOT dispose of these or ever place these in or near a fire. They could indeed explode. I wouldn't carry them loose either--they should be protected in their cardboard case or they should be already installed in your smoke alarm, your tape recorder or whatever device you placed them into.Overall, these Duracell CopperTop 9-volt size batteries are the ones to choose if you need 9-volt size batteries. I highly recommend them for any device that needs 9-volt size batteries.
B00000JHQ6 We use Duracell batteries size &#34;C&#34;  in our LED window candle lights and we get about 105 days of use out of them. We tried Energizers, but we only got about 90-92 days use out of them. Get these on subscribe & save and you will rarely be out of batteries.
B00000JHQ6 It is good to be able to purchase batteries at a reasonable price.  They were shipped in a cardboard box (not the packaging shown in the picture) which was quite easy to open.  I would buy from this vendor again.
B00000JHQ6 I just love to buy batteries with the subscribe and save.  You can't beat the price; then, you have them for what you need plus a few extra.
B00000JHQ6 Item did not arrive on a cardboard card, it arrived in an easy to open plastic case and with the expiration date only 3 years out.  Fresh batteries have a 5 year expiration date. The description and the picture of this item needs to be changed if they are going to sell Amazon customers a different and older item. They were nice and sent me a return label free of charge.
B00000JHQ6 Can't really say much about these batteries as they last a long time.  I have never had any problems with Duracell batteries so will continue to buy them.
B00000JHQ6 There's not a lot you can say, these are excellent, they do just what you want them too and have a good length of life.
B00000JHQ6 There is a reviewer who specializes in reviewing batteries and does a very, very thorough, erudite and insightful job of it.  So it is with utmost temerity and respect that I tread these waters.  I am the last person on earth to demean batteries. I mean, where would we be without them?  No flashlights, no little handfans. No smoke detectors. Can you imagine a world where you had to get off the couch to change the TV channel? I remember those days and it was hell.  No, we need batteries. Without batteries, our favorite gizmos would be useless...but how do you tell them apart?The Duracells certainly look authoritative and batterylike. They dropped right into the battery-compartment of the battery-operated lantern without a fight, making a rather satisfying thudding sound as they hit bottom.  I am happy to report that they did not explode, burst info flame or display any other bad battery behavior.  I remember in the old days, batteries would sometimes Go Rogue on you. You'd open up the flashlight and all sorts of bubbly gray gook would be erupting from them and it was pretty disgusting. I have never seen a Duracell do this, but to be fair, I have seen no other battery do it either, not for many, many years. Obviously we have come a long, long way in terms of Battery technology.The D, by the way was plainly marked, so there could be no mistake...although the size is a dead give away. In the box with your other batteries, they are like Orson Welles in a room full of Don Knotts. So were the little Plus and Minus signs, so you would know which end went in first.  Although they could have been a little bigger, now that I think of it.  A lot bigger.  But none of the other batteries offer this large print, so I won't take away any stars.Dura-Cell implies \"Durable\" so I expected a tough battery -- but really, how tough does it have to be? I'm not kicking it across the road before it goes into the flashlight, am I?  So duration is really the only thing to measure, beyond the other factors previously mentioned.  Now I know some batteries claim to last longer, the energizer bunny and all that, but I always forget to time them and sometimes you use a flashlight or a gizmo more and sometimes you use it less, so it's hard to judge.  I'm assuming if one really did outperform all the others, it would be common knowledge, but it's not, so I just have to go by what I can in terms of rating.  On the other hand, I did buy a four pack of batteries for a buck at the 99 Cent Store.  I think they were call Emmagizers, so naturally I was fooled.  They were not a good choice and I would warn anyone planning to stock up on batteries with names similar to name brands to think twice, particularly if they are intended for your Pacemaker.  So, five stars for a battery that fits into the battery compartment, sports a very manly and handsome combination of bronze and black colors, and so far has given me all that I dare hope for from a battery.One question: Wouldn't it just be easier to have one size battery because invariably, when you have a bunch of As in the junk drawer, the flashlight that burns out requires Cs, and when you buy C cells, the next Gizmo needs Ds.  And it doesn't matter anyway because when you get to the store, you never remember which size it was you needed and buy the wrong size.  And those little guys, the AAs? What's the story with them?  How many penlights are we carrying around already.  And don't get me started on those square guys. And while we're at it, how come there are no B cell batteries? One more thing...those big gigantic flashlights that need the big BIG square battery...the battery alone always costs more than when you buy the flashlight with the battery. SOmething fish going on there if you ask me.This whole battery thing is starting to look suspicious...like it's all being rigged by some international battery cartel. I could explore this possibility more but the cat is now fighting me for control of the keyboard and the only wise thing to do is to log off.  Good night.
B00000JHQ6 No problem with the expiration date as report by others - have 2020 date.  Popped them in - work fine.  Good price.  Prefer Duracell so appreciate the saving.
B00000JHQ6 What can i say they are Duracell and they work. I bought a deal from Amazon that was for outdoor lights that are battery powered and these fit the bill perfectly
B00000JHQ6 This is a good product at a good price.  I placed them in a flashlight and they lit up quite well.  Expiration date is not for another 7 years.  Couldn't be happier and would order again.  I suggest the same.
B00000JHQ6 i have discovered that buying batteries on amazon is a lot more economical than going in-store. i will forever buy batteries online since these were exactly as described.
B00000JHQ6 I always buy this brand of batteries. I have not used one yet, but I think they will be okay.
B00000JHQ6 Not too much to say here, they are Duracell Batteries. I ordered 8 and there were 8 in the package. I put them in my flashlight and they work.The package says \"Best before 2017\", and the batteries themselves say \"Mar 2018\", so they seem to be relatively fresh.
B00000JHQ6 The price is great and the batteries last a long time.  We are very happy with this product.  It is a good buy.
B00000JHQ6 I got these to replace fire alarm batteries. I tested them and they had a full charge and worked just fine. I did end up replacing the alarms (fire alarms do expire) so I pulled these for the future.
B00000JHQ6 I bought these to go along with my Coleman Quad Lantern. They're batteries, they do what they need to, and have lasted ages in the lantern.
B00000JHQ6 Ignore the positive reviews for these batteries folks.  Better you should trust the negative comments and save yourself the hassle of returning dead batteries.  I should have known when they arrived that something was wrong:  They were shipped in a generic clamshell-type package with no label or indication they were made by Duracell - not at all as pictured and a red flag for fakes.  Note to seller:  How long did you think you'd get away with selling dead (and possibly fake) batteries?  Note to Amazon:  Please investigate this seller!
B00000JHQ6 I purchased quite a few toys over Christmas that required batteries. Luckily Amazon has batteries at a low price in large bulk to cover my needs.The batteries show up in Amazons no frills frustration free packaging with an expiration date several days out. Other individuals, unfortunately, have received batteries near or past their expiration date as well as less than acceptable packaging. I would do two things:1) Make sure when you are ordering the batteries that you are ordering from amazon itself and not one of the other vendors that may pop up replacing amazon.2) When you receive the batteries make sure you check the expiration date of the batteries and, if you have a volt checker, test the batteries.Overall a good deal on a wide variety of sizes and quantities.
B00000JHQ6 If you can wait a couple days for your batteries, buy them here! They are a lot cheaper on amazon and the more you buy the cheaper the price. These are true D size Duracell batteries, not your generic style. Great buy! Also if you have amazon prime they shop for free and you save gas money/time.
B00000JHQ6 Came in neat factory pack marked Durablock*that doubles as storage case also.......Says 10 yrs Guaranteed....... Exp date shows as Dec. 2022 ....... Ordered for a small indoor Coleman Lantern that takes four & [2] O2 Cool portable fans that take 2 each.http://www.amazon.com/O2-Cool-Portable-Battery-Operated-Fan/dp/B001AVMSEY/ref=cm_cr-mr-titleAll into an Emergency supply kit in case we ever have a nasty power outage as happened the 1st week of July here in SW Va.......... temps in the 100's ........ Soon that kit will be turned into a coffee or end table....... using large black metal dog cage .. No point in hiding emergency supplies away -
B00000JHQ6 The product date shows the eight batteries are good, however; they came in zip lock bags and not from Duracell.  I purchased them for the smoke detectors and we will see if they go off in a couple weeks.  My concern is you cannot tell if they are used since they are out of Duracell package.
B00000JHQ6 I dont understand why a company would send expired batteries !  they are 4 months past the due date, what good is this?  i am requesting a refund and will not buy from this seller again unless they make good on this purchase.
B00000JHQ6 Ordered them for my home alert!  I store extras in the refrigerator.  I have read that it helps preserve them for quite awhile longer than shelf storage.
B00000JHQ6 It's a little early to prepare for hunting season but it's never to early to be prepared! I will only use Duracell Coppertops in everything I own, just so happens these are going into 2 Mag Lite Flashlights, Duracell Coppertops have never let me down!
B00000JHQ6 Now I don't know what to say other than yes they were batteries and they were charged when I got them.
B00000JHQ6 they arrived in different packages but the batteries are still the same. the best batteries on the market. good price too!
B00000JHQ6 The price is good, they work.  I've never had a Duracell not do its duty in all the decades I've been using them.  Many even run for years, well past the &#34;guaranteed to hold the charge by&#34; date.
B00000JHQ6 It was time to replace the batteries in several of my devices.  These name brand batteries were priced fairly, were fresh, and worked well.
B00000JHQ6 I used these as soon as they arrived and they seem to be working fine and not just some old battery's they are trying to get rid of.
B00000JHQ6 What can I say about the batteries but the are batteries and work just fine and last a long time. You can not go wrong with Duracell.
B00000JHQ6 We always use duracell batteries and buying fromAmazon is a good way to keep a supply on hand.We have used duracell batteries for years.
B00000JHQC I was skeptical to purchase these batteries since they were priced remarkably lower than those at the store, but I must say that they don't seem any different to me. I thought maybe they were getting ready to expire or something, but they are still good for several years and have lasted quite awhile so far. Very pleased!
B00000JHQC What can you say about a battery? They work and were sent as new. I really don't know the life of batteries, but this brand always seems to last longer.
B00000JHQC Bought a 4-pack, used 3, the 4th sits waiting to be noticed some 2 years later. No idea if it's still usable, but I doubt there's much of a charge left in there.
B00000JHQC This is a great deal on the original Duracell Coppertop batteries.  I recommend purchasing them on a subscription, which further reduces the price - below what you'll find in most stores.  For example, I change my smoke detector batteries every six months, so I have a subscription for 9-Volt batteries every six months.  This has helped save money.  The batteries I've received have always been very fresh, with an expiration date long off into the future.  Highly recommended!
B00000JHQC These came factory sealed and were brand new. They are going strong just as I expect them to. I have never had a problem with Duracell batteries lastly well longer than actually needed. Great product.
B00000JHQC In typical Duracell fashion, these are great batteries. They last long once in a product, do not tend to leak and have a great shelf life according to the expiration date stamped on each battery.
B00000JHQC I didn't order these because so many things seemed fishy about their presentation on Amazon. The Duracell photos were all different--none of them D batteries in a package of eight. On the product description page, it looked like AA batteries were shown in the image. When I read reviews, many buyers received their batteries unpackaged, just thrown in a box. Others received them in individual bags. A few years ago, I discovered that rip-off batteries are commonly sold on the internet--not the brands they say they are, but fakes.SOOO...no thanks. I'll go with Ray-O-Vac this time.
B00000JHQC I play my radio 8-10 hours a day and thought I would buy Duracell, even though they are more expensive then the energizer batteries.  These last no longer than the energizer, so no use in spending the extra money, they just aren't worth it.
B00000JHQC We live overseas and rarely receive packages on times but these came really fast and work great so far. Great deal too.
B00000JHQC These are D Batteries. I do not know what else there is comment about them other than the pricing of them is better than a retail store.
B00000JHQC Yes, batteries deserve a review too. Been using these copper tops for years. Not sure why. I guess I just like the copper top thing. Do they last longer than Ever-readies??  I have no idea. FOUR FREAKING STARS FOR BATTERIES!
B00000JHQC performs as advertised and value priced. what more could you ask? i will deinitely order more of this product. i don't know if this has dura-lock
B00000JHQC I was out of these c batteries so I thought I would look around and check the price and how long it takes to get them. Amazon is very fast.
B00000JHQC Duracell batteries are Duracell batteries I assume. It was time to replace the smoke detector batteries and this was a great deal.
B00000JHQC I buy 2 packs of these EVERY MONTH for work. We use them for a digital scale built into our forklifts. This is in use 8 hours a day, 5 days a week... standard 40 hours. I get them with Subscribe & Save. I don't think you can possibly get similar quality for the price, and rechargeable D Batteries!? Yea right!! With the risk of damaging the batteries here, I don't think so. Not for that price. Duracell is the way to go!
B00000JHQC Only good things to say here: ordered these on a Friday and they arrived on Monday (prime/free shipping) - gotta love Amazon! The Duracell brand is always reliable for me. I compared prices with the \"mart\" and the day I purchased them they were about 20% cheaper here. The box states fresh through 2017. Works exactly as advertised.Pleased with this purchase and highly recommended.
B00000JHQC What can you say about batteries. Duracell are dependable, last well. I always use Duracell for important things such as smoke detector.
B00000JHQC These batteries are the longest lasting. I use them for my timer candles. Love ordering and having them in here in 2 days, instead of running out to buy them.
B00000JHQC i love the flameless candles and have quite a lot and it is always great to get these batteries each month on subscribe and save.  i never run out.
B00000JHQC I have tried several brands of batteries. Duracells seem to last a lot longer than Energizer and Rayovac. I have never had any leaking problems. The bulk 9V packs are nice to keep the price down and the Subscribe & Save program makes them even cheaper, especially when you have 8 Smoke Detectors to replace all at once.  I have had my most recent set of Duracells in my smoke detectors for well over a year now.  Yeah, I need to change them out just to be safe.  Unfortunately, the price has gone up on Amazon for Duracell batteries in the last year or so which is making them much less competitive. You really aren't getting much of a deal over local stores these days. I have been converting over to Eneloop Rechargeables this year for AA and AAA batteries to minimize cost and waste, but there are no rechargeable 9V batteries yet.  Due to this price increase, I purchased a set of Rayovac Pro 9 Volts to see how they perform.  I'm not sure if I am going to trust them in the Smoke Detectors yet or just fan remotes and other electronics.  Long story short, Duracells are still my battery of choice.
B00000JHQC This is a standard product.  Not as long lasting as batteries available in Europe - but OK.  Merchant packaged them very well and they arrived on time in perfect condition
B00000JHQC looked for cheap batteries and that's what i got. seemed kinda shady but the batteries worked fine! don't be fooled by the picture they're legit!
B00000JHQC I use these for garage door openers -- have found that even though Duracell is more expensive, they last way the heck longer than the Rayovacs you can get 1/2 price at  Shop-Rite.A bit cheaper on Amazon relative to in-store purchase.
B00000JHQC Duracell 9-V Alkaline Batteries, 4-Count, (Packaging May Vary)I have used Duracell products over the years and have been and still pleased.
B00000JHQC I was happy with these - they arrive don time - packaging was great and the batteries seem to be nice and functional. But they are expensive, and now I have started buying Maxwell's batteries which are also sold on Amazon at a much better price per pack. I don't see any difference yet between the 2 brands and will be moving away fro Duracell.
B00000JHQC Arrived quickly and work as they should!  No issues here.  Would recommend ordering these batteries for all your battery needs.
B00000JHQC Amazon continues to have all the producs I have wanted or needed for everything I could think of. The battgeries speak for themselves as Copper Top batteries. They are guarenteed for 10 years when you get them. Easy to order, receive, and all from one place,&#34;Amazon&#34;, and the price was perfect. Always look to Amazon for your needs.
B00000JHQC I HAVE A HIGH RATING FOR ALL DURACELL BATTRIES. THEY LAST A LONG TIME AND ARE VERY DEPENDABLE. I KEEP DURACELLS ON HAND AT ALL TIMES AAA, AA,C AND D'S.
B00000JHQC This was a good price and very convenient.  I expect these will work as well as the batteries we buy at the grocery store.
B00000JHQC Expiration is 2018, I'm happy. I can't think of too many more words to say so I'll just say, \"yadda yadda yadda\".
B00000JHQC These were just what I needed to restock my supply of batteries. They are dependable and the price was right.
B00000JHQC I dont know if Duralock works or not but its good batteries and what you would expect from one have the top battery manufactures.
B00000JHQC what can you say about batteries... they work ... got them ... they are good... I am happy with my purchase
B00000JHQC This item arrived when promised, was well packaged and therefore undamaged. The price is reasonable, and the fit is perfect in my devices. So far it has my flashlights working as they should.  I Recommend this product.
B00000JHQC Purchased for use in the two smoke alarms.  The perform as expected.  The alarms never fail to go off during my brain failures while cooking.
B00000JHQC Many of the battery-powered devices you use in your home are powered most efficiently by CopperTop batteries. Always trust the Copper Top for your power needs.
B00000JHQC I bought these to use in a blow up matterss.  great price for a size that is hard to find.  Especially hard to find in a large pack.  Duracell is a very reliable brand.
B00000JHQC Does it's job at a cheap price. I like having 4 batteries on hand instead of 1 when those smoke alarms start beeping when the battery dies.
B00000JHQC Whats to say about batteries? I havn't used them long enough to wear them down even if they were defective. I always use Duracell in this type of product. The 8 pk is real nice to have; I don't expect to ever have to buy a D cell again.
B00000JHQC I'm an electrical engineer. The amount of power available from an alkaline battery is almost directly proportional to its size. You don't see many D size batteries used these days (they are fairly large and heavy) but they certainly hold a lot more power than the equivalent AA or AAA batteries.These batteries can be a bit hard to find locally and I was thankful to find them on Amazon at a very fair price.The batteries were fresh and the printed expiration date was over ten years away.Recommended
B00000JHQC Let's face it, Duracell has successfully branded themselves as the best battery around.  And the truth is, I get the best results with them over any other.  They last long, and can keep sustained power for a host of electronics, from cutting edge to the cheapest toy.  Any time I use a bargain brand to save money, I'm quickly reminded that I'm not really saving much, since they die so fast.  So I keep a supply of cheapo batteries on hand for things that don't matter and don't drain a lot of juice.  Duracells, I save for the important stuff, flashlights, radios, emergency essentials.  What good is saving a few cents if I'm left in a pinch during an emergency?  With all the little gadgets I got squawking for juice, I just wish these Duracells cost a little less.  But every once in a while, Amazon has a digital coupon available, and that, coupled with Subscribe & Save, does help.  Other than Duracell, AmazonBasics makes a great battery; but only in AA and AAA.  No 9v that I know of.Bottom Line -- do you really want to trust something important, like a fire detector, to a cheapo battery?  I don't.  That's why I got these.
B00000JHQC The Duracell brand seems to be one of the better batteries out there, good life, and reliable.  Pricing was good as well, same as stores even with delivery.
B00000JHQC They are batteries. They are Duracell. There are 8 and they are D size.  What more is there to say?
B00000JHQC Always good to have extra 9v on hand when the time changes. Cheapest insurance in the world versus your house burning down.
B00000JHQC After my fire alarm went of for a week, I decided to get some batties to replace the old ones.  These are great batteries for my alarm and came in 2 days.
B00000JHQC Buying this battery just saved me a trip to local stores. However its price is not far off from local.So if you just want to put in Add-on or being lazy, go for this, otherwise buying locally is not a bad choice.
B00000JHQC I can't always make it out of the house to get batteries and I don't usually have a D batteries on hand. This was a good price and easy way to get them.
B00000JHQC These were a good price and are still going in some per lit LED floral arrangements I haven't turned since Christmas.
B00000JHQC What can I say. They power my lantern.  I have been a fan of Duracell batteries for quite a while, never had one leak and destroy my electronic devices or flashlights.  I just a fan of Duracell.
B00000JHQC We have been using Duracell for many years, and have always trusted our camping and emergency needs and devices we use to being powered by them, in one form or another.  Sure there are cheaper batteries out there, rechargeable even and solar too; and of course Duracell has their versions of all of these.We do believe in being green, and doing the best to keep our energy footprint small, and we have found over the years we can count on the Copper top for most of our needs.  And of course we should all dispose of them properly.
B00000JHQC The product was perfect and as advertised. There's not much to say about batteries, but, I ordered several sizes bulk and got a good deal on the price, especially considering the weight of a lot of batteries to ship.
B00000JHQC Duracell batteries may cost double what Energizer batteries cost but from my experience they are much more reliable, last longer and are well made. I only buy Duracell now and find them much better. I just put four of these batteries in my new radio and am very happy with them.~The Rebecca Review
B00000JHQC Got these Duracell D batteries at a good price.  Hard to review something like this disposable item but I've always been a Duracell user and find Duracells to be a good value.  If you find these at a good price, buy it!Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you, it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews, and leave a comment if you have any questions, I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help.
B00000JHQC Duracell is normally my go-to battery, although I'll buy Energizers if I can find them on sale. A battery is pretty much a battery, and Duracell has never let me down.
B00000JHQC Duracell Coppertop Duralock D batteries are premium quality batteries, as reflected in their price.  They seem to last longer than every other kind of battery I have purchased.  Although I haven't actually done any laboratory testing, they have been in a particular flashlight I have and have been in there working for about 10 years.  In a crisis or long duration power failure event, these are my first choice for survival.If you are looking for the best battery on the market, I think these are it.
B00000JHQC I had purchased over 50 of these for lighting lanterns for a function. They all performed very well and had no issues. Highly recommend!
B00000JHQC The Duracell 'D' batteries are much less expensive through Amazon than anywhere else.  I bought 3 sets and with free shipping, that's a big saving.I've never had a Duracell battery leak on me.  Normally, I only use rechargeable batteries but I wanted batteries that didn't discharge over time (and 24 rechargeable 'D' batteries are very expensive) for use inMr Beams MB360 Wireless LED Spotlight with Motion Sensor and Photocell - Weatherproof - Battery Operated - 140 Lumens
B00000JHQC What can I say?  They are batteries.  I like Duracell...they seem to last a bit longer than Energizer.  Go Duracell.
B00000JHQC In general, Duracell and Enrrgizer perform significantly better than more generic battrries in terms of battery life. Yhese are no exception. I used them in a stompbox, and even though this is primsrily for practice and jamming, i don't want interruptions to change the batteries. These don't disappoint.The pricing of Duracell on Amazon has also been much better than I can get locally. Before I bought these, I tried three drugstores and one supermarket to see ifIi could pick up a better deal. It wasn't possible. The batteries I could find locally were runnng almost twice as much as these Duracells on Amazon. As long ss that remains the case, I will continue to buy online.
B00000JHQC I have been very pleased with the purchase of duracell batteries. Will definitely purchase these batteries again. purchase them you won't be diasappointed
B00000JHQC I must say that this brand of batteries last a very long time. I don't usually have to buy C batteries, unless they are for my son's toys. I would recommend this product.
B00000JHQC I have been playing the Guitar for over 40 years, 24 of those years Professionally. I have a large number of Electric Guitars with EMG Active Pickups, Duracell has never let me down!
B00000JHQC they work well in my sons bouncy seat by far the most used item in our house that we forget to turn off and these are good batteries that last my pack has lasted over 6 months and still have a few
B00000JHQC arrived promptly. Duracell seems to hold a charge longer than other battery brands, and these C batteries were no different.
B00000JHQC I bought these batteries to power some motion-sensor lights I was purchasing from Amazon.  Because I got them at the same time, shipping was free, so you can't beat that.  And what can anyone say about Duracell, except that they are long-lasting, quality-built batteries?
B00000JHQC I did not try these. I just included these in  a package to supplement the ones in a toy I sent my grandaughter.
B00000JHQC They're batteries. Good batteries. Use them in electronic devices. What more can I say? Here are the six more words.
B00000JHQC I've always been partial to Duracell. They have done me well for 40 years.  These are no exception.  Not always the cheapest but I got a good deal here.
B00000JHQC Had Chinese symbols on the bottom and Euro warning on the side.  Can't find any in the USA with these markings.  Avoid-you're not really saving any money-you're just throwing away what you pay.  Would you trust your family to these in your smoke detector-I wouldn't!!!
B00000JHQC These are duracell C batteries in an eight count package.  Delivered right to my door.  They are the regular batteries the same you can get from the store I assume.  I have had no issues with them at all.  Would purchase again when needed.
B00000JHQC I bought these batteries right before Hurricane Sandy hit and the stores were out of D Cell batteries... I paid wayyyyyy more than I would have at Costco but I didn't return these as they are good to have around in case we have another storm/power outage/etc...
B00002N6SN The name \"Maglite\" has always been, to me synonymous with quality -- I've been wearing this one on my belt for several years now. It's small, light-weight and has a powerful light for something this small. The beam is quite bright for a flashlight this size, and the \"candle\" mode is a nifty feature (especially when the end of the flashlight fits into the upended top).It helped me more than once, especially when in a crowded elevator during a minor power outage. My parting comment to all who were in this elevator with me - \"Why didn't YOU have a flashlight with you?\"My ONLY gripe -- the nylon belt-sheath, which is durable -- not only allows the flashlight to fall out in some situations, but it does not keep the rotating head of the flashlight protected. More than once someone has come up to me to say \"Umm.... your BELT is all lit up!!\"  I solved that problem by sewing a (rip-stopped) strip of nylon onto the top of the sheath (back to front), and attaching velcro to the end of the strip and to the front of the sheath, so now my maglite stays securely in the sheath.Would I buy aother Maglite? Sure! I'd like to eventually buy the whole family of Maglites -- from tiny to huge. They do the job and do it well.
B00002N6SN Update:  I was too harsh when I wrote the original review.  In fact, I bought two more to have handy in case of power failures.  If you use a flashlight for work, say plumbing or cabling in darkish areas, the lack of a single button is a pain; for a reliable light that keeps the batteries fresh a long time, this is a good buy.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Good, solid little flashlight, and very bright.  Just be aware that there is no button; you must rotate the head to turn it on, meaning you need two hands.  This is NOT the flashlight to keep by your bed at night, because if you hear a sound and have to reach for protection and the light, you will be fumbling to turn this on.  Yes, it is possible, with practice, to turn it on with one hand--if your hand is large and strong enough (but not too large!).Another situation:  If you are out walking in the evening and a car starts coming towards you, a button to turn on the light quickly is much better than fumbling around trying to twist the head.Of course if your hand is sweaty or you have put on some lotion and suddenly need a light, again, you need two hands, and even then, you are fumbling.On a postive note:  One way to measure a flashlight's quality is by how well it preserves batteries when not in use.  This is almost as good as its D cell siblings, and much better than any other AA flashlight that I've used.  Batteries stay fresh in this a long, long time.
B00002N6SN I keep this in my globe box for emergencies, additional to my 3 D's maglite. They are really useful and tough
B00002N6SN The literature advertises 5 hours 15 minutes of battery life from 2 AA alkalines, but I get around 7 hours.The candle mode is handy, but it's a tad fussy to reconfigure the flashlight back and forth between normal and candle mode and back.
B00002N6SN was pleasantly surprised upon delivery that the flashlight had a xenon bulb. LED is also an option but is more expensive. the flashlight is well built and the candle mode is unique - comes in handy during camping trips.
B00002N6SN maglite used to be the standard for good flashlites. not anymore. this one has poor illumination and uses batteries like there's no tomorrow. The battery cap doesn't want to thread back on. And it should have a toggle instead of a screw on/off switch. and there's no replacement bulb. and several times when the batteries have been replaced the bulb blew out and they're difficult to find. a piece of S***!
B00002N6SN Cheap, agile little Flashlight that is great for taking on long bike rides in the dark to use for fixing bike, etc.  I dropped it twice on the cement and now it doesn't work sometimes, don't know if it was damaged but still a decent product.
B00002N6SN I bought this flashlight after seeing all the advertising for Maglite.  What a disappointment!  It is small and puts out maybe 20 lumens of light, if that.  The lumens are so low that Maglite never even lists the lumens on any of its products, unlike its competitors.This thing might make a decent booklight but that is not what I bought it for.  For the same price at this over-hyped, underperformer I could get a flashlight 5x as powerful!
B00002N6SN I ordered one of these about a year ago for my husband who was working for an auto shop at the time. This flashlight has taken a serious beating and still works just as well as the day I bought it. Maglite makes the most durable flashlights in the industry at a price that won't break the bank. We're very pleased with this purchase!
B00002N6SN After 8 months of minimal usage (just watching the dog occasionally at night outside)-- the flashlight died.Replacing battery did not work.  Replacing bulb did not work.It was nice while it lasted, but it was not worth the purchase.
B00002N6SN I bought this for my husband and he loves it! It is light and great for him to use quick at work or hand free if need be!  The light is bright and a great buy!
B00002N6SN Compact, lightweight and durable small flashlight.  I keep one of these in my B.O.B and it runs for a long time on the two AA batteries.  Not the brightest flashlight but it will help you see enough.
B00002N6SN I had a light on my shotgun which quit working so instead of replacing it with the same fifty dollar one this fit in the same way as the old one.  This one cost $8.
B00002N6SN This is the standard mini-MagLite flashlight - which I already own one or two.  Since I take one these in my shaving kit, when I travel, I thought I would supplement my supply - especially since as I've gotten older, the need for more light (nearly all the time) has become more important.  This flashlight works and looks great.
B00002N6SN Could possibly be a little brighter, but Maglite is a very trusted brand in my household. This thing works just as well if not better than those cheap 7-LED flashlights you see near the Wal-Mart register. Candle mode on this thing is also pretty handy. Just watch out for bulb heat.
B00002N6SN Over the years, doodles on the Google homepage have made searching on Google more fun and enjoyable for its users worldwide. When doodles were first created, nobody had anticipated how popular and integral they would become to the Google search experience. Nowadays, many users excitedly anticipate the release of each
B00002N6SN This little light is bright but right in the center seems to be a dark area? It loses a star for the dark center, you would think the center would be the brightest but it isn't.
B00002N6SN This is a spare for my tool kit.  The maglites are great flashlights.  They always work when you need them.
B00002N6SN Gift for my Marine son that just deployed to Afghanistan. He loves it and it works great. This is to clip to his gear bag so he always has a light nearby to look for his stuff.
B00002N6SN A Christmas gift for 2 young boys who love to wander thru the woods near their house at night.  They have found goblins, trolls, werewolves, and lions, tigers, and bears....(if you wish to believe their tales!)  They are small in size but very, very bright and the light projects for a great distance.  We can sit on our back porch and tell about where they are by watching the light beam in the trees.They now also turn our couches upside down to make a tent and use their lights to read and play by.  They do that even in the daylight!  The batteries have not yet been replaced after many hours of use.  They made a great gift and got them away from the TV and computer games.  That is the biggest benefit in my opinion.
B00002N6SN This is a short Maglite. I leave it in the glove box of the car. It works great. I have had it over a year and each time I've used it the light has worked fine. It is not a large beam of light; but for looking at small things up close it works fine.
B00002N6SN This was the second one I bought. The first was in red (for me) and this was for my husband. It's great for small jobs when he needs light on a small area.
B00002N6SN I've used the convential sized Maglights, which last a lifetime, but i wanted a smaller version, and found it in this item...it works superbly, throws out a powerful beam of light, and is small enough to carry in your pocket.....love it.
B00002N6SN Exactly what i wanted. Hey its a Maglite you know it is a quailty flashlight. The holster is adaquate and looks like it will hold together a long while. Fits right inwith my SHTF bag.
B00002N6SN As an usher at a music school, I needed to keep a flash light on my person.  This was the perfect solution.  It is mini but still powerful, and the holster is perfect for attaching to the belt, keeping it securely in place.
B00002N6SN I have had several maglites over the years and while reading the reviews decided to get this light because it is LED. WRONG, for some reason most of the reviews are on the LED version and this light is the battery eating krypton version.I have drawers full of these old ones and don't use them because they are just old inefficient technology.I was bummed out and requested a refund and planned to refuse the fedex shipment. But when I cancelled the order they said to just keep it. I really don't wont the damned thing but I think it would cost them more if I now refuse the package.Moral quandary.Maybe I'll upgrade it with the LED kit.UPDATE####################I bumped it up a star because it is now perfect since I added the L.E.D. mod kit by Nite-ize.It now has 25 hour battery life and is twice as bright.
B00002N6SN I've been purchasing Maglite flashlights for years and years. The quality is among the best out there. I also have a 3 cell &#34;D&#34; battery Maglite which is really bright with a great beam. You can't go wrong with Maglite!
B00002N6SN I was looking for this Maglite. But the other ones I saw was priced higher than this one. And this one even came with accessories. The price is really nice to fine. I ended up buying two of them.
B00002N6SN I've dropped my Maglite onto hard floors, submerged it in water, and subjected it to the abuses of a tornadic four year old. The all metal (not plastic!) case is nearly indestructible. Both ends are threaded and are fitted with snug o-rings to protect the innards from rain, humidity, and submersion. The lens housing twists to adjust the focus of the beam and comes off to allow it to be used as a candle (handy for nights in a tent or during a power outage). In addition, an extra bulb resides in the base!
B00002N6SN I have a smaller similar maglite which I have been using for years. This one is just a bit bigger and also displays the quality of these flashlights. I am not sure I will use the holster for much but you never know.
B00002N6SN I had the same one before..too I lost it...I work in a machine shop, running computer and CNC...that Flashlight came in handle all the time...now am in a nursing home...I never know if I need one in my room or for the hall ways...I live in Florida...we do have Hurricanes
B00002N6SN I own a bunch of these and they are great little lights. 2 AA batteries last a long time- I dont use mine everyday so it's hard to say how long batteries last. But using my several times a week, they can last 5-6 weeks. sometime longer.
B00002N6SN I'm surprised to see so many 5 star reviews for this light. A flashights main purpose is to output light. This flashlight does not do that. I own 5 of these that I got over the years but have been one over by the LED lights that throw out tons more light and last much longer on batteries. While this is very well buily and a nice looking light what it lacks in candlepower makes this just an OK light. If you are comparing it to the cheap plastic flashlights then yes, its a 5 star light but what kind of comparison is that? I know the LED lights costs more but they are coming way down in price and worth the extra money if you want a bright light. I can shine all 5 of mine on new batteries onto the wall and they are stil not as bright as my other LED lights, even the cheap ones. I am not talking about the weak run of the mill LED's but the luxeon or cree models. One of those are brighter than all 5 of my maglights put together.
B00002N6SN It's a Maglite, and it lives up to the reputation of its American brand. It's solidly built and works well. This thing will probably last a lifetime.Scroll through the color options because you may be able to find the same flashlight for nearly half the price in a different color. I purchased it with the \"MAGLITE AM2A016 Mini AA Flashlight Accessory Pack\" so that I could attach the red filter and use it for stargazing.
B00002N6SN Bought this and a 2 D-cell Maglite. Put new batteries into both and was disappointed with the weak beam from both flashlights. Not the quality of years past.
B00002N6SN Bought this for myself which I think is a reliable brand. It is the compact size that I wanted for my purpose.
B00002N6SN Do NOT buy a Maglite product unless it's an LED light. Non-LED Maglite products are crap and do not have any usefulness in modern society. LEDs are the wave of the future and yet Maglite is still producing these style of flashlights. When I got the flashlight and turned it on for the first time, I could not believe how dim the light was. It's barely 10 lumens, if that. Do NOT waste your money on this product. Buy a pen light such as a Streamlight Pro or something of that nature that will accept AA's but can output over 50 lumens of light energy. Much more cost effective, lighter, more efficient 
B00002N6SN What can I say?  Maglite is always great and this is just the right size to keep in my nightstand drawer to have in case of a power failure.
B00002N6SN Fantastic little flashlight, just what you would expect from Maglite. Small enough to fit in an emergency kit or household toolbox, yet bright enough to fix a leaking sink at midnight with the power off.
B00002N6SN This is the traditional incandescent Mini Maglite that has been used and loved for several decades now. While it is not expensive ($11, 14 lumens), the old incandescent light bulb technology lacks in many aspects when compared to the new LED technology. If you still like the Maglite design, they offer three Mini Maglite LED technologies; the Mini Maglite LED ($16, 77 lumens), Mini Maglite LED Pro ($20, 226 lumens), and the Mini Maglite LED Pro Plus ($24, 245 lumens bright mode).I found a Mini Maglite once tossed on the side of a rural road at a sharp turn. One can only imagine how it got there. Regardless, the body had some deep scores and dents in it, as if it rolled quite far and maybe even got run over a time or two. I was definitely surprised when I turned the head (it still turned smoothly and easily) and the light turned on, dim and yellow, of course, but steady. I took it home and added it to one of my emergency kits. Unfortunately, I placed bad batteries in it, which swelled up and corroded, causing problems with the springs inside. It was not too much of a loss as it was obtained for free, but the Maglite itself was great while it lasted.I plan on getting the Pro Plus as my primary EDC flashlight as it is made in the USA, to replace my cheap Ultrafire AA flashlight which has been showing random switch issues. While still quite outdated (Maglite is just catching up with the Mag-tac line), the price for the Pro Plus is about one half to one third of the price one would pay for a full-feature tactical light from 4Sevens, Fenix, or Zebralight, which despite their steep prices are all made in China.However, if you have a sentimental attachment to the dim yellow beam of a USA-made Maglite, buy it. Otherwise, get one of the LED models.
B00002N6SN Maglite has yet to disappoint me, and this is no exception: great light, solid, extra bulb in &#34;tail&#34;... and I like the camo pattern, too! Solid value; I'm hoping this lasts for years to come, as have my other Maglites!
B00002N6SN This flashlight looks and feels great but it runs down batteries immediately.  Now my rarely used Maglite can't be opened to replace the battery - I suspect the battery leaked and glued the compartment shut.  In any event, it's dead after a very short life.  Don't buy
B00002N6SN Nothing to be said really, one of the best flashlights out there. High Intensity Light Beam 1/2 turn, cam action focus, spot to flood, Candle Mode (Remove flashlight head and place it on the tail of the light, then stand the light upright)Spare lamp safely secured in the tail cap, High strength aluminum alloy case, O-ring sealed for water resistance, Lifetime Maglite Warranty. Would recommend.
B00002N6SN I really like this little mag-lite.It is a perfect size to keep in my pocket, or in my glove box and is plenty bright for my needs.You just can't beat the quality of MAG-LITE!
B00002N6SN love my little mag .
B00002N6SN It has a &#34;torch&#34; feature where you can take the top off and set it up for hands free like a candle and it is small enough for my  purse which I like because you never know when you need a flashlight and you don't want to use up your cell phone batteries
B00002N6SN Grey is my favorite color. When purchasing mini-Mags for the company, I noticed the grey variety and... glee! It has a nice, dull shine to it, and it works like a Mag. Score! Plus, a holster!
B00002N6SN Maglite flashlights are renowned for their top-notch quality, their waterproof / water resistant design, and their extremely durable and corrosion-resistant aircraft grade aluminum casing. The Maglite AA Mini Flashlight (model: M2A01H) is no exception.Pros----- Comes with a HolsterThe holster has a loop for threading a belt through. It is well-stitched and made of durable nylon.- Waterproof / Water ResistantThe Maglite is immersible in a few feet of water.- DurableThe aircraft grade aluminum makes the casing of the Maglite extremely durable and completely corrosion resistant.- Small and PortableThe Maglite is handy for emergencies, hiking, camping and other uses - and its small size makes it very portable for taking it along anywhere you go so you wouldn't be caught without a flashlight when you need one!- Well-Crafted and BeautifulCons----- Painted ExteriorThe black paint of the exterior is extremely durable but it can get inadvertantly scratched off. If that's a concern, I'd recommend the silver Maglite, which has a bare, unpainted aluminum surface.- Incandescent Flashlight BulbThe incandescent flashlight bulb that comes with the Maglite can blow out, especially when subjected to extreme temperatures.LED Flashlight Bulb Replacement-------------------------------TheTerralux LED Flashlight Bulbis an LED Flashlight Bulb Replacement for the Maglite. LED light bulbs are brighter, use less energy, and have a 30,000 hour lifespan.Conclusion----------The Maglite Mini Flashlight is waterproof / water resistant, portable, and has an extremely durable exterior. If used with an LED flashlight bulb, the Maglite Mini Flashlight is an extremely bright and reliable light source that consumes very little battery power. It just doesn't get any better than this!
B00002N6SN I was taking part in a filmmaking seminar in Maine, and everyone had two tools: a Mini Maglite and aLeatherman.  They all wore them on their belts, and they came in handy on numerous occasions.  Of course I picked one up and I love the little holster that comes with it.  If it didn't look dorky I'd probably wear this and a multi-tool all the time.It's not just good for night use.  Changing a fuse, adjusting equipment, finding something under the desk.  For those kinds of everyday, all-the-time uses, the Mini Mag is much more handy and useful than the largerMAGLITE, which I also own and keep in my closet for emergencies and camping.  Highly recommended for its simplicity, utility, and durability.
B00002N6SN Product arrived on time with all parts as advertised.Included belt loop holster is open ended, however itis easy enough to sew on a cover or button snap strap,add velcro, one column molle, whatever.Body has weave surface grip and tail cap lanyard hole.Popped in the included AA batteries and lit her up.Focus function  A-OKCandle mode  A-OKDrop test 3x at 3 meters  A-OKUnder water 15 minutes  A-OKOne handed operation  A-OK (if you're strong enough)Typical Maglite product.Inexpensive ($10 or so, duh) American made flashlightas opposed to some Chi-Com piece of shit.I like it and so will you.
B00002N6SN I have had several of these for many years. Good for finding a keyhole. Have now discovered the 3 AA LED Mag. Major improvement, a REAL light up the night instrument! For twice the cost, it is 5 times the light. Pass on the 2 AA, move up to the 3 AA LED!
B00002N6SN These are great little, indestructible, basically bullet proof flashlights that go just about everywhere with us. We have them in our car glove boxes, boat cabinet and under every sink in our house. There's a longer one near our front door that serves as a bright torch and also a defensive baton if need be.Carry one in my range bag too, as it lights up just what i need it too in order to make those fine adjustments.Highly recommended.
B00002N6SN We have been buying these Maglite Mini flashlights for quite a while. I have yet to try their LED version, but for now these work perfectly for me. I know that the LED one is supposedly much better, but at this price point, I have a very hard time passing these up.We probably must have about 3 or 4 of these around our home, and I personally keep 1 in every toolbag or toolbox. With the cheap price of these you can have one in every room and anywhere else you can think of. You also have a wide variety of colors to choose from, but I stick to the modest, classic black annodized.I know that this is just a review for a simple flashlight, but I believe Maglite to be the best, and I hope this review helps.
B00002N6SN focus-able beam is nice. I had already bought a TeraLUX ministar2 extreme upgrade for my existing mag and liked it so much I decided to buy this to put it in a less scratched up case. for a conventional bulb the stock bulb is not very bright and unless you have a led module for it already or know enough about electronics to make one I would buy the mini mag LED. If you do know enough about electronics you can buy led lights, cut the leads and add your own heat sink for fairly cheap from parts here on amazon, I did this to my old mini mag (you can find instructions on instructables) and not as bright as the TeraLUX but 2-3 times brighter than stock for $2 in parts.
B00002N6SN I have been a fan of Maglite as long as I can remember. I don't want a flashlight that breaks easily because when I need it, I NEED IT. The Maglite line has alway been durable and solid and feels good in the hand. The design is well thought out like the \"candle mode\" to light a space.This package has a nice holster, but it is small enough to fit easily in most pockets. Over the years I never had to replace the halogen bulb in a maglite but they typicall provide one spare in the bottom just in case. That kind of thoughtful reliablity plus nice design make this as great as the bigger ones.There are two of these in my house plus a LED model too. In my opinion this mini-maglite does everything I need very reliably. I can depend on it when it counts.Hope this helps someone.
B00002N6SN Works exactly like it should. This is our all-around pocket-sized flashlight. It's bright enough to candle eggs with or see pretty far on a dark night. It's also really durable. As a klutz, I can tell you it withstands being dropped on a pretty regular basis.
B00002N6SN I think this is much better than regular little flashlights.  Good light, adjustable beam!  Just don't let little kids play with it.  My son broke my first one.
B00002N6SN flash light is rugged and for what I paid  it was a steal ,it shines beam well over 100ft at night enough you can make out images in dark ,best little light to have on hand and you can even hold with teeth if need be when changing a flat at night or expand beam to cover larger area ,its best buy for quality that you can buy and shop amazon for best deal.
B00002N6SN mini lite was just the right size for me to use when I am fixing or repairing something and need a different size of light rays to see something tiny or in detail.  The size of the barrel of the flashlight is great for my hands when I need both of them to use and can just use my fingers to grasp instead of the whole hand.  Brightness of bulb is excellent since you can adjust the rays to be full or small to see just the focus of something detail.  Light also came with an upholster to store and wear on your body so you can carry for camping use or hiking use or even for your work when needed.  It is convenient to have in a holder so you don't have to hand carry it.  Great product for the price you pay.
B00002N6SN Bought this exclusively for my travel kit. A very sharp light to keep me from crashing into furniture/luggage as I make my way to the bathroom at night. Also, the battery is lasting longer than some earlier maglites I have owned. Nice!
B00002N6SN Standard Maglite construction. It's sturdy, but other flashlights put out a better beam for the money.  This is my second one. I bought it for its candle effect: the top of the light can be screwed off and used as a base to make a sort of candle, which is useful in power outages.
B00002N6SN Purchased a year go and love this little flashlight.  I have it hanging on my front door ona little hook, so I always know where it is.  Used it too many times to count, so nice to have one around.  And AA batteries last forever, still have not changed mine.Candle feature is so useful as well.  If people ask me what flashlight to get, I immediately point to this Maglite.
B00002N6SN I love the design of this. It's great to keep in your purse but after keeping it for a while, it uses a lot of batteries. Also it doesn't give me the hi beam type of light I need at night in the dark.
B00002N88C This Bucket And Wringer Is Great For mopping Up Your Basement And Garage. It Makes Mopping Up An Easy Task.
B00002N88C This bucket and wringer are wonderful. It is sturdy and large enough to do the job without being too big and heavy. Using with my new O' Cedar fiber mop makes the task of mopping my floors quick and easy.  I would definitely recommend this mop bucket with wringer.
B00002N88C gets the job done , built to last , I am not big on moping but I have to and this makes it easier.
B00002N88C I needed a mop bucket for my apartment and bought this one strictly because of the Rubbermaid brand. It works well in that capacity. This bucket can be used with or without the wringer attachment .
B00002N88C This is a good mop bucket except I thought there would be some kinkd of lever or handle that would squeeze out the water. It did not have that. Even though that was missing, the mop was not dripping wet when used. Thats why I gave it 4 stars.
B00002N88C my hand don`t touch dirty water it`s so easy to use it`s wonderful my bucket came it was grey i didn`t care
B00002N8QW This big pack was a huge problem solver for us.  We don't have a car so we navigate the shopping chores carefully.  We are within walking distance of many different stores and we do have a hardware store nearby but the usual purchase of a regular box was used quickly which meant constantly walking to the hardware store for refills.  Buying these has been a big relief for me, since I do most of the walking.  I am still using these and it has been MONTHS.  I will do this every time. The price is not painful and the large number of bags makes it a real deal.
B00002N8QW We use these bags in two of our trashcans in the kitchens.  We have a kitchen on the main floor and in the basement and these 13 gallon bags are just the right size for our kitchen trash containers.  By the end of the week they are pretty full and we dump some smaller trash cans into the sacks as there is still room and then they are full to the top.  I have never had one leak or tear on me and I like the tie flaps to close the bag securely and to carry it outside.This is a good product and we will continue to use it and I recommend it to you.  The price here is high compared to what we are paying and you might want to shop around.
B00002N8QW I love these bags. Since my local supermarket stopped carrying them I drive a long way out of the way to another branch that still does just to get these. I'd buy them online, but they're a lot cheaper at the supermarketI do use them in a can that's slightly smaller than 13 gallons, so I don't care if they can't be filled with exactly 13 gallons of garbage. What I like about them is: (1) they are very strong - I have never had a puncture or a rip, even when I had sharp objects like broken glass in them; (2) they don't have drawstrings, which I absolutely HATE. I love the tie-flaps; they make a much tighter seal than drawstrings ever can, and they never break or pull out when you try to tighten them as drawstrings tend to do.If somebody knows of cheap, strong kitchen bags without drawstrings that are better than these, please share them; but they can't come from Costco because the closest Costco is more than 100 miles away and in Canada, and I don't have a passport.
B00002N8QW I'm clueless as to whom these trashbags are marketed. I bought them and find them pretty annoying. For one thing they DO NOT 'stretch and grab' as the marketing info says. They just hang there. If you want grabbing, try Hefties &#34;Hefty Gripper Tall, 13 Gallon Kitchen Bags). They're awesome.The other thing Easy-Flaps don't do is hold as much garbage as other Tall Kitchen bags. Because of their construction they barely fit our can, plus unless you under-fill them, there is not way to tie them off.The only good point about these bags is that they are 1 mil plastic. Otherwise they fall far short of what's needed in the kitchen.
B00002N8QW I have been using these bags for a while, and they work just fine. I plan to continue using them, and I would recommend them.
B00002NC1L Probably not as large as I expected but it seems to be doing the job.  I will order a different kind next time.
B00002NC1L I am the dishwasher in my home, and I like good tools. It's been a slog to find a truly good dish brush, and here it is. I used the amazon.com info and went to Ace and found the same brush sold individually. Bought one, and have been using it now for two months. It cleans very well, is easy to keep from getting clogged, and it doesn't splay out bristles very much. I've trimmed off about half a dozen bristles all in all, and the brush still has a lot of life left in it. The UPC at Ace for the individual brush is 0 4130104554 3. I like this brush enough to think that I'll buy the dozen-pack when this one gets too far gone. Washing dishes with a good brush makes a lot of difference.
B00002NC1L Not very sturdy. Bristles are too soft.  Only lasted about a month before I wanted to get a new one.
B00002NC1L I was disappointed to see what a short handle this has. However, that's my own fault I suppose because I didn't read the description before ordering. It does what it's supposed to though
B00002NC1L We're not much pleased with this brush. It's way smaller than we wanted and, owing to the angle of the head, one has to get their hand in much closer in to the grubby dish or pot they're scrubbing. That makes it hard to apply much force. We bought another brush in the same order, the Libman Kitchen Brush which Amazon also sells and which is a mite cheaper. It's a far better brush, bigger and better designed. This one is ok but not good enough to recommend.
B00002NC1L Review for: Rubbermaid Dish BrushA review for the humble dish brush.  I'm not sure what it is about this one but I prefer doing dishes with it more than the many other kitchen dish brushes I've tried from various retail stores and supermarkets.  I'll gladly waste time looking for this one buried in the sink before using another one just sitting there looking at me longingly.Like a car that lets you still feel the road, the bristles are flexible and unbunched enough you can get hard pressure right into the problem spots.  Flip it around and you get nice scraping action.  Use it with your hand close to the brush to get control as you target the corners and tough spots.This same flexibility means it won't look like new pretty fast compared to the ones with stiff bunched up bristles, however even scrunched up it still continues to work great.  So hats off to this simple, classic rubbermaid dish brush standing the test of time.
B00003IE4E The price was right and the item came fast. The batteries are a good brand so I am not worried about leaks as with the cheaper batteries.
B00003IE4E I switched back and forth between these and the duracells. They both seem to perform well, however I do tend to think the copper tops last a bit longer, but they are also more expensive so it is a trade off.
B00003IE4E work fine, fast shipping
B00003IE4E They work, and work well.  Funny how there is still some applications for these things.  I thought they went away ... Too, order and they arrive in a day or two ...
B00003IE4E From reading previous reviews others have had problems with getting old batteries.  FYI, I received batteries which will expire in 2018, in the original Energizer Max packaging.
B00003IEME I purchased this for my weather station.  It has a unit that you install outside to measure outside temperature more accurately.  I am using low discharge rechargeable batteries and they can't handle the below freezing temp; they are showing almost empty after just a couple of weeks.Lithium batteries are rated to perform even in extreme conditions from -40 degree Fahrenheit up to 140 degrees Fahrenheit.  Also, you have to hold to realize how light are these batteries compared to other conventional batteries.
B00003IEME I use these in my external flash for my SLR. They work great have a very fast recovery time and have not disappointed. They also have lasted quite some time now as advertised.
B00003IEME I used these when I went on a month long safari. Had no chance of resupply and did not want to take too many standard batteries as I found in my experience that the high humidity, despite being in a tight container, drained most of the charge before I used them. Took two sets of these lithium AA plus other brands as backup. Didn't need them as the one set in my camera and one set in my recorder were still working good after I had returned. They endured over 100F to a 32F at night, 90% humidity, heavy rain, damn mosquitoes (ah..wait..that was my gripe) and worked very well. Did not have a problem with having to wait for them to recharge my units like other cheaper brands.
B00003IEME What can I say, look at the amp hour rating and that says it all. These are the only way to go.
B00003IEME The flat discharge curve of lithiums means they will stay above the UVLO (Under-Voltage Lock Out) conditions of your electronics power supplies. Today's electronics do not just keep working until all the juice is gone. They monitor the input voltage and when it drops too low to guarantee a stable output, they shut off. Normal batteries may still have some juice left in them but nothing other than flashlights can really make use of it. Lithiums go most of the way from full health to death in a relatively flat curve so your electronics will get longer life. Maybe only 10% to 15% wasted energy left when done compared to 40%+The price is worth it.
B00003IEME Good long lasting AA batteries sold at a good price on Amazon...not always available in the stores at home or abroad; I carry a bag of these when traveling overseas to put in my little camera, head lamp, etc...they last and last....
B00003IEME Even so, they last a long long time and the extra price is offset by the fact that you would be paying more to buy a comparable quantity of the other shorter-lived batteries.However, when they die, they DIE (I have found that they don't temporarily refresh themselves like the shorter-lived batteries do, when I turn off my camera and then turn it back on after a few minutes) -- so keep an extra pair (or however many you use in that specific device) on hand for the day the inevitable happens.And I believe that Lithium is more earth friendly -- and if I am not mistaken, these can be recycled????
B00003IEME I put these batteries in a battery-driven can opener.  Nickel Cadmium batteries were not holding up more than a couple of weeks.  These Lithium Ion batteries have been in use for about three weeks now, and I have not noticed any loss of power.  I'd buy these batteries again.
B00003IEME Cheaper to buy batteries online. Lithium last longer. Keep in a cool place, but not in the refrigerator like alkaline batteries.
B00003IEME A very good brand and product. It holds a charge. Not like the lithium, but works just the same. Again with the minimum.
B00003IEME These are the best batteries money can buy.  They last forever in my Garmin GPS (at least 3 battery changes versus alkaline), and weigh nothing.  It's a perfect use...keeps the unit super light for clipping to my backpack, and can go all day for several days without replacing.
B00003IEME We got a new point and shoot camera, and it was chewing up regular brand name AA's like they were going out of style.  Discovered these at the local big box store and decided to give them a try.  Wow.  In the name of full disclosure, they cost more than a standard pack of batteries might.  But let's face it, you don't want the camera conking out prematurely at the championship soccer game or that once in a lifetime vacation.  I simply can't recommend these Lithium Energizers enough.
B00003IEME I purchased these rechargeable batteries for electronic devices which do not need the power capabilities of gamming batteries. They work well as designed.
B00003IEME Assuming that this is the equivalent of the Energizer Lithium aaa battery, it is phenominal. I have been using  them on my MuVo mp3 player, and they last far, far, far longer than regular batteries. The only problem is that they are hard to find because they are so new.
B00003IEME Less than $2 a battery and it lasts a lot longer than regular Energizer. I use these in my wireless optical mouse and in my MAGLITE flashlight. Will also purchase lithium ion batteries for my thermostat and fire detectors.
B00003IEME I didn't buy these on Amazon, but I was so happy with the performance of these batteries, I had to add my review here.I recently inherited an old Olympus Camedia E-1 digital SLR Camera, and as I soon realized, the camera eats regular batteries at an astounding rate. The normal batteries I had at home were lasting for maybe a dozen shots before they would completely die. I ordered some rechargeable lithium batteries from Amazon, but I needed an inexpensive set of batteries that would get me though for a few days until the rechargeables arrived. So, I went down to my local office supply store, and picked up a 4-Pack of Energizer Lithium batteries hoping that they would do the trick. They did. I did a lot of shooting over the weekend that I was waiting for my rechargeable batteries to arrive, and I even used the LCD display occasionally to shoot with and to review my photos (something that, on this camera, would make other batteries die instantly). But the Energizers continued to work great.A week later, I had my rechargeables, but the energizers were still working, so I decided to keep them in until they died. I haven't done a whole lot of shooting...mostly a few shots here and there on weekends, as I get used to how the camera works. I was surprised when the batteries lasted through another weekend. Then another, then another. These batteries literally got me through two months of casual weekend shooting (say, a couple dozen shots or more per weekend), even with the LCD display on. For a relatively inexpensive set of \"throwaway\" batteries, and knowing how poorly other batteries performed with this camera, I couldn't have been happier with the performance of these. The Energizer Lithium batteries gave me serious bang for my buck.I'm absolutely sold on these batteries, and will definitely be buying more as backups to my rechargeable set.
B00003IEME Lithium Cells are rapidly becoming the new gold standard for many household uses, from simple flashlights to sophisticated hybrid vehicles.  These lithium-ion batteries are now ubiquitous at the retail level and their popularity has steadily increased because of their power efficiency compared to more traditional delivery technologies far surpassing carbon-zinc, nickel-cadmium, nickel-metal hydride and alkaline.Here Is my Assessment of The Energizer AAA \"Ultimate\" Lithium:PROS:1. Superior in power efficiency compared to above-cited technologies.  Lithium cells hold their charge longer and become superior performers in retaining their charge.  When stored properly (in a cool, dry and dark environment), these cells self-discharge rates are substantially slower compared with previous generations of batteries.2. Unlike nickel-cadmium cells, lithium-ion batteries have no (or a very negligible) \"memory\" effect.3. Lithium Cells appear less likely to leak and are not as vulnerable to extreme temperatures compared with previous technologies.4. Lithium-Ion cells also perform better at lower ambient temperatures than their predecessors.5. Lithium-Ion batteries are noticeably lighter than previous types of cells making it an additional plus in heavier types of equipment such as larger flashlights, power equipment, etc.6. Energizer cells have expiration dates considerably longer because they discharge much more slowly compared to previous generations of batteries.7. Lithium cells are more environmentally-compliant and friendly compared to previous generations, particularly those cells which contain toxic, heavy metals such as cadmium and mercury.CONS:1. My rating on these cells is 4.5 stars due to the perceived steep price points of the Energizer brand that most folks believe.  However, if you do the math, as another astute reviewer has, you will find that lithium cells are actually a more cost-effective choice when compared to an equivalent-sized alkaline battery.  Nevertheless, you are still likely to pay more for a name brand such as Energizer, in order for the company to recoup their research and development costs.2. Lithium cells may be a safety hazard, particularly when exposed to high temperatures for sustained periods of time.  For this reason, the federal government has imposed transport restrictions on lithium batteries.  Although these restrictions have recently been relaxed, lithium cells can and do explode because they contain a pressurized, flammable electrolyte. For this reason, it is advisable to store these cells in a temperature-stable environment.3. Energizer currently has several different \"versions\" of their \"Ultimate\" Lithium batteries on the retail market.  Some packages state \"up to 4x longer\" while newer versions announce on the front of the blister card up to 8x or 9x longer in selected devices.  Be careful to select the latest available expiration date card(s) to avoid purchasing an earlier version of the product. Each cell also has a production/ lot code embossed on it; however, they are not at present, user-identifiable without assistance from Energizer.BOTTOM LINE:1. These are excellent batteries when used properly and in the correct equipment.  In consideration of the longer storage and discharge interval, my recommendation would be to use lithium cells for those appliances and equipment requiring longer replacement intervals such as fire, smoke and CO2 detectors; water sensors, outdoor sensors, digital cameras and remote controls to name just a few.2. Avoid storing these cells in extreme temperatures-cool, dark and dry is recommended for maximum shelf life and safety. Avoid storing lithium cells in the refrigerator or freezer.3. Energizer lithiums are, in my opinion, no better than those manufactured by other reputable companies.  As such, price shop.  If store (generic) lithiums are available, shop with your wallet.  This is an excellent technology but you need to use and store them wisely.
B00003IEME In an outside sensor for an indoors weather station, these batteries rock. I spent years with my outside weather readings coming and going before I read the manual and saw that they now suggest Lithium batteries. Stuck a pair of these dudes into the remote sensor and have not had a problem in cold weather. With the Duracells, and I love Duracells, I was always loosing my outside temperatures anywhere below 30 degrees (F). So far I have gotten to -4 (F) with no dropouts. Very nice.
B00003IEME These lithium batteries are great. They are long lasting, lightweight and work great in freezing temperatures. Their \"BEST BY\" date is often ten years or more. If you have a device in a fridge or freezer or outside where it gets cold/freezing, then these are very useful since alkaline batteries will often fail in cold temperatures. They are also useful for devices that are inconvenient to change batteries, like clocks or wireless outdoor temperature or motion sensors. If you're wealthy, then you might as well use these instead of alkaline or rechargeables, but because of the relatively high cost, I only use these for \"special\" applications. Otherwise I use alkalines or Sanyo Eneloop rechargeable batteries.
B00003IEME Installed on a detector where the ceiling is 15 Ft. Hope they last as long as they say they would.
B00003IEME Since the nearest Walmart is 70 miles away, I was happy to find this battery on Amazon at a comparable price--with fast shipping!  It is a long-life battery that works great in my outdoor sensor for my thermometer.  With temperatures reaching below zero much of the winter here, I want a battery that lasts.  This one does!
B00003IEME Great batteries!! The only kind I use for my digital cameras. Last a long time compared to regular alkaline ones.
B00003IEME I purchased these as open box for $14.95 with free Prime 2-day shipping.  I received two unopened packages of five each NEW Lithium AA batteries.  They all test as new.Careful Amazon shoppers: keep their eyes open for deals like this.
B00003IEME These batteries hold up well to high demand electronics like my digital camera.  I won't use the rechargeable batteries any longer.
B00003IEME These work very well.  They aren't as green as rechargeable, but these do last longer than regular batteries.  Highly recommended.
B00003IEME The combination of long battery life and light weight suit these lithium cells uniquely for hand held devices such as wireless mice. Pop them in your wireless mouse and say goodbye to grip fatigue. Your mouse will be light as a feather.
B00003IEME These batteries really let you drain every little bit out of them. Make sure you use them in the correct devices, as others mentioned. They worked great in a digital camera w/ flash. I tried to use them in a headlamp - and they didn't fair so well. However even after I thought they were dead, if you let them \"sit\" for a little while, you can come back and get a little more life out of them (few more shots/flash, light, etc). It was kind of funny how many times the camera would power off, and I'd let it sit for an hour and come back to find there was some juice back in them. If you have a high drain electronic device or you need longevity/cold temps in your battery - then definitely give these a try. However if you have more average/lower draw electronics, these may not seem to last as long and can be quite expensive comparatively to alkalines.
B00003IEME Buy, but shop for sales. CHECK EXPIRATION DATES. THERES ALOT OF OLD STOCK OUT THERE
B00003IEME the advantages of lithiums over alkalines are plenty. while lithiums do cost more than alkalines, the biggestadvantage lithiums have over alkalines are shelf life and operating life especially in extreme cold temperatures.other lithium advantages are 35% less weight and most of all, no leakages(unlike alkalines) which is especiallyimportant since leaking alkalines can cause product damage as well as personal injury thus making lithiums saferthan alkalines as well.
B00003IEME My digital camera takes way more pictures with these batteries installed than just ordinary, standard ones.  If you want some serous battery life, these are for you
B00003IEME I got these batteries specifically for my wife's digital camera and have been pleased with their performance to this point. When I first tested them on my battery tester they pegged the needle with their power; I've never seen another battery do that.They've been in my wife's camera now for several weeks and I test them again before we take it out for use and each time they've showed a full charge which has surprised me. If anything develops noteworthey I'll update my review but so far they have exceeded my expectations.
B00003IEME Nice batteries, however pricey. I bought these because in extreme cold temps, alkaline's were losing some of their juice. These seem to do better about holding consistent power and working in temps of around 0. I imagine these would be excellent in digital cameras due to their light weight. I would say they are half the weight of an energizer alkaline.
B00003IEME I love these batteries!Something to consider tho, is that a Warehouse Club 48-pack of regular 2800ma alkalines are about the same price.  So for low-current applications where maximum life, cold weather performance, weight, etc. isn't critical, there are much more cost-effective choices.AND speaking of critical, I had a little digital safe at the office (for postage stamps, the checkbook, spare car keys, and such) that ran on AA's.  I used it for years on regular alkalines and replaced them every 3 months or so.  When the alkalines got low, it would still weakly open 5 or 10 times to give me plenty of time to change them.  When I switched to a set of these lithiums (to reduce how often I had to do the replacement procedure) they lasted just over twice as long, BUT when they died, they were totally gone-ola.  I think they're way better at putting out full voltage to the end - which is ordinarily what you want out of a battery, unless you lock the manual-opening keys in the safe itself!
B00003IEME They sent them quick when I ordered, they so far aredoing great in my camera. I hope they continue to lastas long as the literature with the camera says they will. If so, I will be happy, will only have to purchase them once a year.
B00003IEME I have always used alkaline batteries. I'm lucky if the alkaline batteries last 20 minutes. Now, I can use my camera for longer periods of time. I take digital photographs and shoot videos. I am very happy with this purchase.
B00003IEME They DO keep going and going and going.  These have more power and yet are lighter in weight than your typical battery, AND they hold their charge for 10 years.
B00003IEME These batteries are the recommendation given by the manufacturer of my Canon SLR camera and their endorsement is enough for me. Amazon usually has the best price on these and with Prime shipping it's extra convenient to have them show up at the door to boot.This is a new (to me) camera so I'll be keeping track of how many photos/videos I can take before needing to replace the set.For me, Energizer is a trusted name in batteries though and pleased to recommend the brand.
B00003IEME I use these in the outdoor intercoms at my office as they are not temperature sensitive like regular or rechargable batteries (lithium batteries seem to work as good for me at Zero as they do at 90 degrees, while regular batteries seem to lose their power in cold weather). My outdoor intercoms require 4 each of these and they last on average for 2 years (regular batteries last 6 months or so) regardless of outside temperature. Only drawback to these batteries (and some might consider it a plus) is that when they go they go. By that I mean they do not gradually lose power like regular batteries. They are either fully up or dead. I am very happy with them. I also use them in my Flip Video Cam, my digital camera, my outdoor weather station sensors (which display outside temperatures to my indoor weather monitors), my led bike lights and just anywhere where I have something that is battery powered outside in the weather. Now buy them by the case. Another great thing is that these batteries have a long shelf life of 10 to 20 years so you can buy them today even if you may not need to use them for 5 to 10 years or so.
B00003IEME What can you possibly say about batteries? Either they work or they don't. I haven't had them for a very long time so I don't know yet how long they are going to last.
B00003IEME When I can't use rechargeable batteries for my electronic gadgets, I will choose these batteries for their longer life (and lighter weight doesn't hurt either).
B00003IEME We have sensors for temperature and humidity in our attic.  We found that regular batteries do not work well in the cold of Maine winters. Buy these Lithium batteries has made a huge difference. The extra cost is absorbed by their longevity.Here's my TIP on those attic sensors or transmitters: TIP: I did find it best to purchase and use &#34;Energizer Ultimate Lithium&#34; AA cells. Not only do these last longer but are not really affected by the hot or freezing temperatures found in attics (and you don't need to climb up there to replace batteries every couple of months).
B00003IEME I purchased a new iMac at the of April, and needed to replace my mouse batteries after 5 weeks.  So, someone recommended getting Lithium batteries which I did--and they only lasted 11 weeks!  :(  For the price I paid, it's definitely not worth it.  I'll go back to my AA batteries purchased from C*stc*.
B00003IEME Great value and recommended. I use these for our temp sensors, driveway alert unit, and mailbox alert unit, in cold Montana. AA and AAA. Highly recommend the lithium, for cold weather especially. I will buy again and think this is a good value. I hope this helps someone! Fast ship.
B00003IEME When you have those items that are used everyday I prefer lithium over the less expensive regular batteries especially in items like a PC mouse, TV remote, various camera's and separate flashes, certain flashlights....just remember that heat is the enemy of anything reliant upon battery power.
B00003IEME I got tired of having batteries fade out on me when I needed them the most.  Also frustrating is constantly having to keep a supply and having to change them often.  These lithium batteries last longer than any others and I use them wherever they can work.
B00003IEME these are really the ultimate disposable battery. at 10 times the capacity of a lead acid and nearly half the weight there is no reason to not replace all your nicad and lead acid batteries with these. I put a set in my headlamps and they usually last me a year or more. Much nicer then changing them nearly monthly
B00003IEME They work as promised.  I use them in my digital camera and they last a long time.  They were delivered in original packaging like you would buy them on a store shelf.  I trust the Energizer name and would buy again.
B00003IEME My husband really likes rechargeable batteries, beca
B00003IEME I read reviews, found the best type of battery, then found the best price on line at Amazon.com.  I love when every thing comes to the front door.
B00003IEME If you need AA batteries and can afford them (they are pricey) these are the ones to get.  They last a very long time and have excellent shelf life.  I mostly use them in a portable testing device that I occasionally forget to turn off, and they still just keep going, and going, and going.
B00003IEME Again these lasted as long as they were advertised to, the set lasted several months.  I wish I had bought more so I could stock up.
B00003IEME THIS BATTERY GOT THE CONSUMER REPORTS RED DONUT FOR EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE, NO OTHER BATTERY DID, PERIOD. THEY TESTED 16 BRANDS.
B00003IEME These aa batteries are worth the price because these have such a better life span over alkiline batteries.I don't have to replace the batteries as often and are probably as cheap in price as twice as many of the comparable alkiline batteries.I do highly recommend these batteries.
B00003IEME I thought that these batteries would (as promised in the advert.)last 8x longer than regular Alkalines - NOT.  I guesstimate that I get about 40% more time on both my cameras, but not the 8x promoted.  For the price (double to triple the cost)they are not worth it.
B00003IEME We were skeptical about the charge life of these batteries. Well, they really do last considerably longer than a regular &#34;Alkaline&#34; battery. Haven't tested the shelf life yet, but there is no reason to believe that it isn't longer too.
B00003IEME I bought these for my thermostat which uses these batteries.  I wanted long life batteries  since when replacing batteries on my thermostat erases the temperature programming, which is a laborious process.  These are the very best you can buy.  A good buy.  Item arrived at least one month late, but in good condition
B00003IEME I have used these before. This 8-pak is priced better than a 4-pak at W-Mart. These batteries are great for digital cameras, they go much longer than regular alkalines.
B00003IEME I have a Microsoft mouse that insists upon the batteries being at top voltage.  These AA Lithium batteries are the only ones that will run for a long length of time.  Rechargeable only work about two weeks.  Alkaline batteries work about six weeks.  And these lithium batteries will work for many months.  Once the rechargeable batteries or alkaline batteries drop even slightly in voltage, my mouse begins to perform poorly.  These lithium batteries seem to hold peak voltage almost to the end of life.
B00003IEME Best battery you can get for all those battery eating devices  -- remote controls. wireless mice and keyboards, LED desk lamps and flashlights.
B00003IEME Use AA and AAA lithium batteries in everything around the house.  They last so much longer than regular alkaline.  Alkaline lose power just sitting, while lithium not so much.  Like this brand.
B00003IEME The main thing that I like about these batteries is they function at peak power until they run out of power.  There is no slowing down before they run out of power.  I have not noticed them functioning at 9X longer lasting.
B00003IEME I've used a couple of these in my older ePulse that usually uses up recharegeable batteries in a day, or Alkalines in a few days. These batteries have been used every day for short measurements of pulse rate for over 2 months now.
B00003IEME I bought these batteries thinking they where rechargable, but they aren't!These batteries lasted a very long time, I would say about 4-6x longer than my rechargeable batteries, in my ebook reader.Pro's:Long enduranceHigh power outputExcellent for both high power devices (like digital camera's or flash) as low power devices (clock or ebook reader).Cons:Non-rechargableDon't last as long as they mention on the package (4-6x not 8x longer than rechargeables, and about 2x longer than Duracell batteries)Conclusion:I would never buy these batteries for the sole reason that they are non rechargable.Otherwise they are excellent for small electronic devices like clocks and small portable radio's and ebook readers.For high power devices, though these batteries are excellent, I would especially recommend to get rechargeables!
B00003IEME Wife took 143 indoor pictures, many flash, in one day and they were still firing away at the end of the day. They cost more but last longer. Rechargeables are the green way to go but to take that many fotos would require a handful of batteries, if traveling with limited space these Energizers are the answer.
B00003IEME When energizer brought the lithium chemistry to a 1.5v (in reality 1.7v) AA battery they gave the consumer a choice.  I purchased these for a specific application, allow me to explain.Earlier I had purchased the honeywell weather station (wireless) which relies on AA batteries - I think I used 28 doing the install.  Some locations were a royal pain to get to and I did not want to try and change 4 batteries with 8 tiny screws on my roof very often.Enter the L91BP.  Batteries have a price.  There is the cost of acquisition here on amazon, disposal, and the time spent replacing them.  Let's say you estimate your time at $40/hr which is reasonable for any engineer.Assuming a good grade alkaline is $1/cell and these are $2/cell to change 4 batteries I am spending an extra $4.  If they last 7 times longer, I've avoided 6 trips up on the roof to change them.  If it takes me 1 hour to remove and re-install the batteries, then clearly at $40/hr I have come out ahead buying the more expensive cells, since I saved 6 changes, or $240 worth of my time.I also put a second temp meter in my deep freeze and set an alarm on it on the receiver.  Because alkaline cells dont perform in sub-0 temps, I used the L91-BPs again for that application.Now the products that are easy to change the battery in did not get the lithium cells, however they may if removing the 8 tiny screws without loss becomes a pain.Cons:Because of their 1.7V output, some flashlights may be overvoltaged with 4 of these in series and caution not to use lithium AA cells.
B00003IEME I was a little hesitant to try out the lithium batteries due to their cost. But after having used them I will never again use standard batteries.Sure they are more expensive, but since they last several times longer you end up paying roughly the same in the end, but you don't have to constantly swap out batteries anymore.My favorite item to currently use these in is a little external speaker I have for my iPhone. I use this to listen to music or watch movies. The other reviewers for the speaker indicated about an average life of 8 hours before they had to change batteries. I have used it now for months without having to change batteries and no signs that the battery life is diminshing at all so far.I have also put them in several other small electronics around the house now, but really it has not been long enough to determine how the batteries are doing in those devices, but so far I easily have at least 30+ hours of movies/music played on my speakers and we're still going strong. I should have already had to replace the batteries at least 3 times by now if I had used normal batteries.Absolutely worth the money.Standard Energizer 4pk - $4.18[...]Ultimate Lithium Energizer 4pk - $8.32[...]At only double the cost this is a no brainer. I am already over 3x the duration of normal batteries and still going strong, package claims 8x the normal battery life, so I have a ways yet to go before I can expect my first set of batteries to die even though I have been using them pretty regularly for months now. Even if I don't get the advertised 8x life expectancy, I am already well over the cost difference between the two battery types.
B00003IEME These work great in my new Nikon L12.  I have the rechargeabels, but they would be drained down so quickly in this camera, that it became a pain in the neck all the time.  These new lithium are little pricey, but they make taking digital photos a lot easier.
B00003IEME OK they are expensive batteries.  I purchased them for a digital camera.  They provide power for an extraordinary number of photos.I used two of them in my remote mouse.  It was overkill but the mouse is still going big time.The batteries were sold and shipped by Technulty..  They substituted 2 4 packs for the 8 pack.  No problem with that.  They arrived promptly.
B00003IEME I have used these Batteries before, and they last a very long time. And have plenty of power, so the battery goes a long way. One thing I like about lithium batteries  is, you can use them out in the cold weather, and they never freeze. They have plenty of power,  AND LAST A VERY LONG, LONG, TIME. I Highly Recommend the Lithium Batteries. Jim in Ohio.
B00003IEME These batteries are light-weight and work well.  This is the easiest way to buy them.  Good price and no shopping around.
B00003IEME Put in wireless mouse in mid july.They died today.The last batteries came with mouse made by china batteries too I put in before x-mas.So cheap lasts 7 months.Real expenisive 2 1/2 months ? Guess which one I'm buying now ?
B00003IEME Reviews say these batteries do last longer, and they are worth the higher price.  I did a lot of videos before I drained the batteries.  I didn't keep track, but I believe they did last a lot longer, and this is what I will use in my camera, hence forth and forever after.
B00003IEME I am sold on Lithium batterys. For the money they are the best value for your buck. Sure they are a little more expensive but in the long run they last so much longer.
B00003IEME What can you say about batteries? They work as expected and the packaging was a bit easier to open, although improvements could still be done to make it easier to get out the first battery without destroying the package.
B00003IEME These batteries according to reviews on other sights are the longest lasting ones you can buy. So far so good. Great selling and they are what I ordered. I find that many items are less expensive on Amazon.
B00003IEME Bought these for some trail cameras taking videos, with sound, field scan etc.  Are holding up well (better than new Alkaline)  and the price was great. They also have a listed Shelf Life of 15 years, and are supposed to last 9 times longer than Alkaline batteries with high drain applications. I recommend the product and the seller Brooklyn Battery Works.  Purchased some more of these from Mel Pierce Camera (an actual store but on Amazon too)  at a cheaper price and they were delivered fast. Reason I mentioned the sellers is due to what appears to be some scammers selling them . Both these sellers are fine, fast, priced fair, new in the package.
B00003IEME These are the 6x lithium ion batteries, not the 9x ones.The unit price is much better than I see in stores and these batteries really last a long time.  I use them in my green laser pointer because they last so much longer than regular alkaline batteries.  The higher price is more than offset by the long life.  Buying them on Amazon makes them an even better deal.
B00003IEME Lithium batteries are suppose to be the #1 battery to use, thats if you want to have long lasting.I have not yet used them. I am ordering for some but my question is.Does anyone know if these would be good to use in my son Xbox controller for his game? Please, if anyone could answer this, I would appreciate it. Thank you
B00003IEME We read about using lithium batteries in a digital camera. We bought these for a cruise we just took. We took over 500 pictures and some video with our camera.  We are still using the first two batteries! Worth the extra cost for the amount of life you get and we don't have to pack and take the recharger!
B00003IEME Started using these for my camera and still use them for my external flash. Now I use them for all my AA needs as they do not leak ever but last a LONG time. I wish I could install a few in me.
B00003IEME I don't know about 9 times longer that but these are the only batteries that will power my digital Kodak camera. As soon as they start to get even a little weak, they won't work in my camera but I can still use them in other gizmos. That's a plus.
B00003IEME Generally, I have many positive experiences on Amazon with the exception of this vendor. Please let me explain; I received these batteries and noticed that they had an expiration date of 2027. Wow! I was \"pleasantly surprised\" for the long shelf life. I then placed the batteries in my drive way alarm and noticed that my drive-way alarm did not work properly. I immediately thought that I had a defective drive-way alarm. However, I decided to check the volts of these batteries with my multimeter and was quickly surprised that 5 batteries out of 8 were defective and actually was only producing less that 1 volt. They should be 1.5 volts. After contacting the vendor, they had me send the batteries back for testing which I had to pay for. Since then, I have not heard hide nor hair from this company. They will not communicate with me. That's wrong! Do yourself a favor and purchase these somewhere else....
B00003IEME As many reviewers say, it is important to use these for the right job.  Simply putting these in a TV remote would be a complete waste of money due to thier price.  However, when used in an apllication that requires increased performance, these batteries are completely worth the price you pay.Mostly, I use them for flashlights for camping and other tasks around the house.  They not only make my flashlights last longer, they increase the brightness and will not fail in freezing temperatures.  I own some pretty expensive flashlights also.  The lithiums are far less likely explode or leak like alkaline have been known to do.  It has happened to me and ruined a flashlight on me.  That being said, I recommend these for your high-end electronics like digital cameras or two-way radios and the like.  They will perform better and will not be ruined by a battery malfunction.The other great thing for the camping aspect is the lightweight of the batteries themselves.  This allows me to pack them into my system and not worry about weight as they feel seemingly hollow, almost cheaply light.I highly recommend the Powerpax battery caddy sold here on amazon for storage in camera bags or your camping system.  They keep them from coliding with each other and getting damaged.  You can seem my in-depth review on these items as well to gain an idea of how well they function.You can also buy these in bulk as the shelf life is 15-16 years as advertised.  I can not vouch for this personally but it is an intriguing idea for sure.Also, I beleive the 12 packs sold in Sams Club are the best deal I've found as each battery came to be $1.67 a piece.  However, sometimes the prices on amazon drop and they become a better deal and vice versa.Overall, I highly recommend these batteries for those tasks that demand performance.  They are worth the price and will keep your expensive electronics safer.
B00003IEME Hopefully these perform as described. They are exactly what I need, but who can tell until they run down how long they will work? While I was away from my Home this winter, the alkaline batteries in my programmable thermostat died and did not turn on my heating system. I barely missed getting frozen pipes. If they perform as described they will be cheap insurance for repeating this problem, but I don't know if they will work for even 10 years, but certainly I can count on a couple of years from them, fingers crossed.
B00003IEME I use these batteries in my digital camera. If you aren't going to use batteries that you can rechange, these are your best bet. You'll still go through a couple of sets during a full day of shooting, but nothing like if you're using normal Energizer.
B00003IEME I didn't notice 9 times longer useage but then again I wasn't measuring real close.  I didn't think it was worth the extra money but, that shouldn't be the definitive answer for anyone! :-)
B00003IEME They are used in an Acurite weather station that we purchased.  The weather station has an outdoor sender that it mounted on our patio.  During the coldest parts of the year, the temperature on the patio can be in the teens.  Acurite, in the manual that comes with the weather station, recommends that lithium batteries be used in the outdoor sensor.As recommended by Acurite, we used the lithium batteries in the outdoor sensor.  We purchased these batteries about a year ago.  So far, the batteries have performed flawlessly.  We haven't yet had to replace the batteries in the sensor so I can't comment on their life, except to say that it's at least a year, at least for our type of use.
B00003IEME I only use 2 brands of batteries Ultimate Lithium in my life/critical devices and duracell ultra in everything else.  The lithiums do last longer in and also preservation.  Great price on these from amazon, can't go wrong for smoke detectors, carbon monoxide detectors, camera flashes, and battery powered weather stations.  For everything else and toys Duracell Ultra is your friend.  So as you see i like both and recommend both.
B00003IEME These batteries lost a really long time, it's a little pricey but the price i worth it trust me, I would buy again.
B00003IEME I was using rechargeable batteries and i was getting tired of having to switch out the rechargeable batteries and find fresh batteries or wait to recharge the battery. Anyone with a Roku gaming remote knows how they eat up batteries. So far these batteries have been great and I will be purchasing more in the future for other devices.
B00003IEME I know you probably think it is wasteful to use these in a Mouse, but my Logitech mouse was going through AA alkalines every 2 weeks. Switched to these and the mouse has been running for over one year!
B00003IEME These may last a little longer as advertised, but I'm going to buy the rechargeable type from now on. I use too many of this type to have to buy often.
B00003IEME It's the season for batteries. May as well get a bulk packet the shelf life is 10 years these days
B00003IEME One of the most frustrating things about cameras with disposable batteries is how quickly they eat through them.  Energizer Ultimate Lithiums help solve this problem.  I've used a bunch of different brands in my cameras, and these last longer than any other brand I've tried.With these batteries, you get days of use in a camera rather than hours.  I won't buy another brand for my cameras.
B00003IEME This is the only way to go for my wildlife camera, which sits in single-digit weather for hours, covered with ice.
B00003IEME Supposed to last 6 to 8 times longer than alkaline or rechargeables and produce 600+ pictures on a digital camera. Took between 20 and 25 pictures.  Next day, camera turned on, flashed low batteries, and died.  Eveready wants the batteries for testing.  Seems to me, they have already been tested. MJR
B00003IEME These batteries are the &#34;ultimate&#34; - just as the labeling on the package states.  They last much longer than normal batteries, especially in electronic items like digital cameras or remote controls.  I have a difficult time finding them around my home, so I'm glad Amazon sells them.
B00003IEME Trying for the first time because they are suppose to last for years.
B00003IEME It really is worth the extra dollars to get these because they do last longer and don't ruin things like:  flashlights, meters, blood pressure machines, and most other battery operated electronics.  We have never found one exploded inside a battery compartment like we do with the older type batteries.  Heat and cold doesn't seem to make them corrode.  We only wish we could find the AAA Lithium batteries again in the 8 or 10 packs :-).......
B00003IEME These are expensive for daily use, I'd recommend NiMH rechargeables for that, but they're perfect for low temperature use (car flashlight in Minnesota winter, digital camera use outdoors in the winter) when both alkalines and NiMHs fail to deliver. These would also be, with very gradual storage loss, great for an emergency electronic device. Maybe for GPS or LED flashlight. Do check that your electronics are happy with these batteries installed. I've heard of both digital cameras and GPS units (Garmin GPS60) that did not.
B00003IEME There are a lot of people that need more of a charge with electronics that only alkaline batteries cannot do, especially today's standard of electronics. Energizer has made that accomplishment with their Ultimate Lithium batteries. They work absolutely well in my hi-tech chargers for my Iphone and Ipod Touch, without the hassle of charging it to my computer all the time. They are simple to use and work great. I was pleasantly surprised at how good they can run, but when I tried them in my instant Energizer Charger, I was convinced that they were excellent at the power they have given me into my player. If you have a smartphone or a camera that needs more than alkaline batteries, I definitely recommend you give these a try from Energizer.Price: BCharging: B+Overall: B 1/2+
B00003IEME Despite the price these are great for anything you need to rely on and/or cannot easily access to change the batteries
B00003IEME I needed some extra strong AA batteries to keep the quantum gate open between this world and the world I normally rule in, called Nibiru.  OK, really I needed some extra strong batteries to work in my portable dental sonic pick - and these perform very well.  The price on Amazon was very good and mine arrived in an 8-pack as described in the description, so I am a happy purchaser of this product.
B00003IEME For almost everything in my household I use Sanyo eneloop rechargeable batteries, and could not be more pleased with them.  However, I recently purchase several LED emergency road flares, and wanted batteries which I wouldn't need to check frequently.  While the eneloops are also good for long term storage in the cold, they discharge faster when it is hot, and don't perform as well in the cold as these lithium batteries, which are rated down to -40F.  If you need these for more heavily used devices, you might want to get rechargeables, but these store well and operate in a wide range of temperatures.
B00003IEME These are the best non-rechargeable batteries for high drain devices such as digital cameras. They last a very long time in those types of electronics. Don't buy these batteries for low drain devices such as remote controls or clocks. Instead just use cheap standard alkaline batteries for those. The price that I bought these Energizer lithium batteries on Amazon.com is the cheapest I've seen and I highly recommend them.
B00003IEME They cost more then regular batteries but worth the price. I only use these in more important stuff and or hard or a pain to change items.
B00003IEME Item originally came out in a plastic case and they let me return the batteries for a 4 pack in the normal store packaging.  They also sent a return-shipping label free of charge.You are able to get a better price if you accept the batteries in the plastic case, I just wish the item description picture would look like what they sent me, so I have downloaded a picture of both for you to view above.Prompt, great customer service.
B00003IEME No other battery works better in mySteriPENwater purifier, AA-cell powered digital cameras, high-intensity search lights, and sound-amplifier.  In each of these high-drain applications, the Energizer L91 Lithium AA cells genuinely last 3 ~ 5 times longer than premium alkaline AAs - especially in cold weather.  They seem to have good shelf lives, which is nice for some of my remote campsite caches.  They regularly outperform all but the most expensive NiMH rechargeable.  While 14500 cells yield even better results in high-drain applications, they aren't as commonly supported in electronics equipment (only two of my flashlights give me the option for AA or 14500 cells).  CR123A, 186500 and other specialty cells also outperform, but I appreciate the ubiquity of the AA form factor.  When I'm deep in rural parts of the country, I'm more likely to find alkaline AAs, than CR123As, in a pinch.  As such, a lot of my gear relies on top quality alkaline, low self-discharge NiMH rechargeable, and these Energizer Lithium cells.
B00003IEME I am currently using these batteries in my thermostat.  They cost less than my previous batteries and are said to last far longer.
B00003IEME Great brand at a great price that always delivers superior service.  Love them for things such as remote controls, cordless mouse, cordless keyboard and such.  Very long lasting
B00003IEME I primarily use these batteries in myNikon SB-600 Speedlight Flash. I started using them about a year ago after much frustration with the lifespan of normal alkaline batteries. I am not a professional photographer but it is a pretty serious hobby (addiction my wife would say) of mine, and nothing drives me more crazy than my equipment becoming the limiting factor of what I want to do creatively. Replacing batteries in the flash on what seems like a weekly basis is annoying--running out of juice in my camera flash at the wrong moment is much worse and can even be devastating depending on the context.Thankfully these excellent lithium batteries from Energizer are truly superior in performance over either normal alkaline or rechargeable batteries. I get 500-700 shots out of a set of these, which makes them economical compared with the seemingly less expensive alternatives.It is possible to find these batteries in larger packs at big box stores, but they're actually the same price per batt
B00003IEME excellent product, highly recommended these work very well in my old canon digital camera will most likely buy more of these
B00003IEME lightweight powerful, holds a hell of a charge. my go to for all my high end electronic devices. came right away
B00003IEME The Energizer L92 Lithium AAA cell is a fantastic power source. For high-drain applications, it offers great advantages over ordinary alkaline cell and rechargeable NiMH cell. However, it is also very expensive as a disposable battery. So it is important to recognize the strength of L92, and use it only in applications that give you the best results. Otherwise you'll be wasting your money.According to data sheet published by Energizer, the capacity of this Lithium AAA cell (L92) is 1200mAh. This number remains nearly constant with load current. In comparison, the ordinary Alkaline battery (such as the Energizer E92) is also rated as 1200mAh, but only at a very light load of 25mA. At a heavy load of 500mA (typical for a P&S; digital camera), its capacity is reduced to about one-third. The difference gets even greater at low temperature. At zero degree C and 500mA load, the L92 can provide about seven times more energy compared to the E92. This is where the marketing claim of \"Last up to 7 times longer\" comes from.When used in a digital camera at room temperature of 25 degree C, the L92 is more likely to last 3-4 times longer than alkaline. This is enough to justify its price, which is also around 3-4 times higher than alkaline. However, in low-drain applications (such as smoke detector, wireless mouse or remote control) alkaline cells will last just as long at a fraction of the cost.The L92 also contains much higher energy when compared to rechargeable NiMH cell such as theSanyo Eneloop AAA. This is partially due to its higher terminal voltage of 1.5V, which is 20% higher than that for NiMH.Energy stored in eneloop AAA: 0.8Ah * 1.25V = 1.0Wh,Energy stored in L92 : 1.2Ah * 1.5V = 1.8Wh (80% higher).Higher terminal voltage for L92 is especially advantageous in digital camera applications, because your camera flash will recharge up to 20% faster. On the other hand, it may create problems with some applications such as unregulated LED flash light. Higher than expected voltage will make the lamp burn brighter, but the excessive heat may also cause the lamp to burn out quickly.Bottom line: If you need AAA batteries for a long hiking trip or for emergency standby, then L92 is obviously your best choice. For most other situations, I recommend using low self-discharge NiMH cells for lower operating cost.
B00003IEME I go through these batteries every 6 months and these work well under very demanding use running a motor.  All tested well and arrived quickly .  Packaged as shown.  The price is very reasonable
B00003IEME Only way to go with compact Digital Cameras.  Regular alkaline batteries will last only a few shots.  These are WELL worth the money!
B00003IEME I have used the Lithium battery for around two years now in my camera,remotes,flashlights,etc.... I've found them to be of great quality and superior to even the legendary &#34;Copper Top&#34;. This time Amazon has as good a price as I can find locally and having Amazon Prime made the difference in my purchase ! You do not go through very many of these. Seem to hold on to their power well!
B00003IEME These batteries work great in my digital camera. They have a long shelf life and hold up many times longer than alkaline batteries.
B00003IEME For 98% of things in AA or AAA or 9vdc I use niMh rechargeable.  These lithium, non-rechargeable batteries are really very expensvie compared to recharging your own many times.But if you want a battery which won't run down quickly on its own, or a battery which works adequately when it is cold, these are worth the extra money.
B00003IEME May 29, 2014: What I received expires in 2027 so it is either old or doesn't last 20 years. Also, mine does't have the \"20 years\" printed on the package. It was shipped from MYBATTERYSUPPLIER.
B00003IEME Amazon lists these batteries under rechargeable AA batteries.  They are NOT, repeat NOT rechargeable.  I would not have ordered them for the application I purchased (underwater strobe for week's diving) if Amazon had not incorrectly listed them.
B00003IEME I was so tired of having to replace the batteries for my remotes, I decided to give these a try and I'm glad I did.
B00003IEME These have extremely long shelf life and NEVER leak.  They have about 9X the capacity of Alkaline when used in high drain devices.  In low drain applications they don't last much longer than Alkaline.  I don't use Alkaline much anymore because many of them (even new batteries) leak and damage battery contacts.  Eneloops are also an excellent alternative to Alkaline and don't leak.  For infrequently used flashlights the Energizer Ultimate Lithium are a superb choice.
B00003IEME These Lithium batteries are so much lighter.  These have help up to longer run times on my high drain devices.  I knocked a star of for packaging.  They come in a non-standard clear container not meant for these batteries that will make you think they are used.  I have a battery tester and they all tested 100%, so I am ok with the purchase, others may think they are used batteries.
B00003IEME Seem good and are separately packaged which I like. Would buy them again.
B00003IEME Not everyone needs lithium batteries. But my backyard weather station recommended lithium for extreme hot or cold climates. These batteries arrived fresh and in the original card (just like the picture). This price on Amazon is very good, and delivery is straight to my door.
B00003IEME Energizer lithium batteries are money.  They cost a lot, but they're definitely worth it.  I use them in an led headlamp and it's noticeably brighter.
B00003IEME Here's the real deal...they last longer ON THE SHELF but no longer than Duracell when in use. The company ships fast, I'll give the product 3 stars for creative wording (basically tricking the consumer).
B00003IEME The price on these batteries was very good, shipment was quick and so far I am very pleased with the batteries.  They seem strong, so I hope that they will last awhile.
B00003IEME How do you rate a battery that lasts 9 times longer when you have only had it for a couple of months.  They work and hopefull will continue for a number of months to come.  It's worth a try so as not to have to replace them very often.
B00003IEME I've used these batteries in applications that go through a lot of batteries: a camera with a battery-draining display, and some speakers with no AC connection.  In the camera one set of batteries lasted through 656 pictures including 8 videos approximately 8 minutes in length each.  The speakers were used approximately 6 hours a day for 14 days and are still going strong.
B00003IEME I've just ordered a second supply of these batteries. The first set I used in a pair of salt and pepper grinders. The first thing I noticed is that they seemed to be more powerful than the Duracell batteries I was using before. They are still running strong after three month's of constant use. I would highly recommend Energizer Ultimate Lithimum batteries to anyone looking for the best, longest lasting battery. I am thouroughly satisfied with them.UPDATE: It's now been over four months and they are still going strong. I've purchased another pack of 8 just to keep them on hand when I need them. They have a 15 year shelf life so I'm not worried about them going bad over time.
B00003IEME These batteries last very long are very lightweight and very powerful. You spend more but you get more out of them.
B00003IEME I use these in a portable water pic which is essential for my current denatal situation. I travel alot to remote areas and they hold up for a long time. I recommend them.
B00003IEME Delivery was very good. I have never used these before, so I have to reserve on a possible 5 star review. The governing factor will be if they actually do last 9 times longer. As they are in the package, they look fresh and ready to go.,
B00003IEME The power contained in these batts is amazing. They seem to last forever and forever and ...............  You get the picture.
B00003IEME I use these in my Canon DSLR flash attachment to get consistent, fast-recycling that simply can't compare to rechargeables or even standard alkalines.  They last a long time, retain power even when they're just sitting not being used, and provide excellent power for photo equipment.  These are worth the extra cost because they last way longer and maintain their high power throughout their life cycle.  I'll be continuing to use these for my camera equipment (though I'll use rechargeables for less critical devices like remote controls, Wii remotes, toys, etc.).
B00003IEME These batteries have a specific use: They are the navy seal or special ops of batteries. You don't want to use them in your every day juicing of low drain applications. They are for the knock down drag out applications that other batteries can only handle for minutes. Camera flashes.  Remote control cars. High drain applications where you need a battery that can go in and provide high power for a specific use.They're expensive, they're finely tuned to provide maximum output for maximum time on high drain activities. Don't waste them on remote controls, mice or smoke detectors.
B00003IEME I used to love these Energizer AA Lithium Batteries.  No more.  The life of the battery is far too short compared to the ones I have bought in the past.
B00003IEME great price, and last a long time. Cheaper than in the stores, and when they are dead, I take them to be recycled.
B00003IEME There is a huge difference in lithium compared to regular batteries.  Really useful if you store your electronics for extended periods of time because they do not leak.  I am a believer and will put lithium's in all my electronics.
B00003IEME I'm still &#34;out to lunch&#34; on these batteries.  I normally puchase Duracells but I willing to try anything new once.
B00003IEME The best battery that you can ever find!if you simply calculate,you wil understand that it's cheaper than Alkaline!
B00003IEME These batteries work great.  Last longer on the shelf, are much lighter in weight, and have more capacity.  Great for your Camera Flash!!
B00003IEME I bought these for a digital camera which went through alkalines every 30 photos. After researching how alkalines drop to about 1.2 volts after very little use and then level out from there I learned that these lithiums maintain the 1,5 volts for a much longer period of use and consequently allow my camera to continue to work through about 120 to 150 photos. I also use these in the outside unit of my weather station because they will not fail at subzero temperatures like alkalines do. The added cost is worth it in some instances but probably not for general use.
B00003IEME Tried these on my Lacrosse Technology weather center in which they require a minimum voltage. These batteries meet minimum requirement and more......
B00003IEME The Energizer Lithium AA battery 8-packs are great value.  I discovered these batteries as they came with my Apple wireless keyboard and mouse.  I was incredibly impressed by the longevity of those particular wireless devices, when powered by these lithium batteries.  I went several months without thinking about batteries in them.  By comparison, afterwards, I used traditional alkaline AAs and the same devices lasted only a few short weeks.Now I am again enjoying the benefits of these lithium batteries.  This 8-pack sold on Amazon is a particularly great value. At first I thought the lithium batteries were too expensive, when I saw a 2-pack in a store, for nearly ten dollars.  With this package on Amazon, the batteries usually cost around two dollars each.  A great value and not much more than alkaline batteries, for a lot longer lasting power!Lithium batteries also work better in extreme temperatures.  If you, for example, have an outside thermostat for a weather station, this will work in the winter, whereas an alkaline battery may not.An interesting tip, when my higher power devices, like bluetooth keyboard, runs low on power.  I go ahead and pop one of the used lithium batteries into a clock.  I'm not sure how long it will last, but it's a great way to recycle at least a few of your almost drained lithium batteries.Now I've started using these, new,  in powered toothbrushes, and I find it's a lot more powerful and longer lasting.I highly recommended these for devices that quickly drain regular alkaline varieties.
B00003IEME These are \"niche\" batteries. They weigh half their Alkaline and NiMh brothers, store more energy, work in very low temperatures, and sit on the shelf for a decade without losing their charge.As everyday consumables they make no sense (for that, look into Eneloop rechargeables). But as the cells that power your emergency flashlight, your GPS on the Inka Trail, or your radio during a blackout, they are a godsend.Note that the voltage of these cells is slightly higher than regular AA's. Therefore, some devices actually *won't work*, at least not when the cells are fresh and fully charged! For example, people have posted problems with Garmin's Gpsmap 60csx or some regulated LED flashlights. I'd recommend you check with the manufacturer and test your device with those cells before placing them in your survival kit.
B00003IEME I have used this product for years and know how reliable they are and I would never hesitate to buy this product!!
B00003IEME I had previously purchased another brand and after a few charges would not hold the charge. With these batteries I have been able to recharge them without issues and they keep their charge for a long time in my camera.
B00003IEME We purchased an indoor/outdoor thermometer.  The manual stated that it would be a good idea to use lithium batteries when the temperature outside dipped around freezing.  It is a probe outside is wireless and I will change the batteries today to lithium.  Lithium batteries have a longer lifespan than alkaline batteries and Amazon's price was fair.
B00003IEME arrived quickly from amazon, use it in my high tech led flashlights, i used to use the rechargeable ones to save money and recycle but they leak sometimes and do not last at all.. decided its more effective to use these lithiums, i own a few 4sevens, and fenix flashlights and they work the best with these.
B00003IEME got 'em quick with no problems. yes they absolutely last longer [I use them in a lable maker]. These are great batteries but are not for every app. I do not recommend using the 9v version in a smoke detector. The lithium bateries by nature go until they are completely exausted then suddenly they are completely spent wih no warning. The alkilne batteries slowly get weaker thus letting the detector let out those annoying squeeks which tell you the detector's batteries need changing. Not to keen of a flashlite blinking out with no warning. But, the tremendious shelf life and longer runs between changes is a real plus.PS Check to see that you are getting the correct ones for your needs. They have different life spands of lasting 4,5,8 and the ultimate of 9 times longer than alkiline batts.
B00003IEME I have bought several packs of these through amazon with no issues. These batteries are fantastic and I can't recommend them enough over crappy alkaleaks!
B00003IEME I use these primarily in photography equipment.  They last many times longer than standard batteries.  I have used them for a number of years and am very happy with them.  I just wish Energizer would make some that are lithium &#34;rechargeable&#34;.
B00003IEME Bought these for one of my trail cameras and they worked great. Just brought the camera in at the end of the season and the batteries still have charge left in them. They were in use for a couple months and the last few weeks have been very cold with many nights below zero. Happy with these batteries.
B00003IEME I bought these batteries specifically to go in the outdoor portion of my indoor-outdoor weather monitoring station. I tried normal alkaline batteries first, but they do not provide enough voltage when the temperature is low. Then I tried NiMH rechargeables, but those crap out at an even higher temperature. Then I coughed up the extra money for lithium, i.e. these batteries.These batteries are the only ones that work when it is very cold outside. Lithium wins!These are approximately the cheapest lithium batteries on Amazon, that is how I chose them. And they are a name brand. Go figure.
B00003IEME What can you say about these Energizers?  We expect and get perfection from the product which doesn't disappoint. Good batteries.
B00003IEME Lasts longer on my golf GPS than any battery. Duracell good but these last at least 3x as long. Good to see they work as advertised.
B00003IEME I like the long shelf life of these batteries, combined with their extended service life in my digital cameras.  Because they last longer, I have the convenience of carrying fewer batteries on photo outings and trips.
B00003IEME works great
B00003IEME I mainly use these battery's in remote sensors where they far out perform alkaline battery's.  I first got a lesson on their advantage was with a golf logix GPS. Alkaline lasted 2 rounds of golf where the lithium can last around 6-7 rounds. The only downside is when they are done, it's all over. They don't gradually go down like normal batteries.
B00003IEME There are no better batteries on the market none, that power my digital cameras better than these. They are costly but last many times longer than anymI have tried.
B00003IEME i was uneducated in lithium batteries. i thought they were rechargeable. but have come to get info from energizer via their telephone rep..that only lithium ion batteries are rechargeable...that lithium batteries as these are NOT.to me then, the price value is just not there. for the price paid for these i can buy around 36 good alkaline cells.update: i have found these batteries to not last as long as regular alkaline batteries....e.g. i get about 6 months use on a clock from an alkaline but only two months on these lithiums....obviously then i will stick with alkaline over these....i have tho moved to using rechargeable cells for nearly everything anymore- usually the enelop from sanyo- these are very good and certainly cost effective...
B00003IEME I love using these batteries. Very powerful and like lithiums provide full voltage and power til the very end - not like alkaline that gradually loose power and voltage over time.A super battery and reliable.
B00004OCL3 I'm enjoying this brush!  The handle is easy to hold and it reaches in places that are hard to get to.
B00004OCL3 Feels strange to be reviewing a brush I use to scrub my tub.  Brush is a tad bit smaller than I would like, but certainly gets the job done.  Well built and I get the impression it will last for quite some time.  Overall a good choice for the price
B00004OCL3 to hold and is an effective scrub brush. Another item requested by Occupy Sandy for the clean-up. I have one of these myself!
B00004OCL3 I ordered this scrub brush with the intent of using it on sinks and showers. I first used it when I threw my microfiber couch cushions in the laundry and they came out stiff. I used this brush to easily bring back the softness that microfiber is known for.Since then I have used it for sinks, tile, shower, and linoleum. It has worked fabulously each and every time and it is now my go to scrub brush. It is extremely comfortable in my hand, they did a fantastic job with the ergonomics. It is easy to apply gentle or firm pressure based on the situation.If you need a versatile brush that works well and is comfortable in your hand, this is it.
B00004OCL3 Excellent for the bathtub when scrubbing the ring around the tub. Easy to grip, easy to use. I think you will like this brush. It does what you expect it to do.
B00004OCL3 This is good for cleaning the wheels on an automobile.  I have not use it for anything else as of yet.
B00004OCL3 well designed;easy on hands; effective
B00004OCL3 This brush has very stiff bristles that can clean very well, but they also bend just enough to scrub away without doing damage. I use it all over my bathroom and it works like a charm
B00004OCL3 This brush is great for cleaning bathtubs, showers, sinks, any surface requiring light scrubbing.  Soft bristles do not damage surfaces.
B00004OCL3 I've never owned a scrub brush that was this size. I mean for a small hand it is PERFECT. I just cleaned the bathtub yesterday and I was able to get to hard-to-clean corners because of it's size. Bristles are strong. Handle has a good feel. This brush puts all other brushes to shame. I will NEVER buy another brand again.
B00004OCL3 Superb bristles, a great handle, this is a really well done product. Useful for tubs, floors, sinks, whatever. Very much recommended.
B00004OCL3 I like the grip and the way the brush part hold up.  Hard to excited about a brush but I am most happy with the results.
B00004OCL3 Use this brush for many things.  Cleaning dirty socks before laundering, clean area where dog chews bones on couch, tub cleaning.  Holds up well.  Bristles excellent strength and do not break.
B00004OCL3 Brushes are very sturdy and great deal! Ordering more for other uses such as carpet in the cars and tires!
B00004OCL3 Heavy duty and a miracle worker on dirty carpets! I love this scrubber. It has an easy handle that can handle any carpet job.
B00004OCL3 When it comes to this type of product I always go for the OXO brand first because I haven't bought one yet where I do not like the grip. They, by far, have the most comfortable grips than any other brand I've tried and this one is no different. I like how small the brush itself is and how easy it is to use it for long periods of time without my hand hurting. I've been using it regularly for four months now and it is starting to show wear and tear but you know what? It's inexpensive and I like it so much, I don't mind having to buy a new one. This time, I think I'll get two :)
B00004OCL3 I expect a scrub brush to be designed for medium/heavy pressure.  The shape of the handle in my hand doesn't allow me to just press down and do the job.  Rather, the roundness of the handle wobbles back and forth (left to right versus back and forth) in my palm.  Also when wet the handle doesn't feel solid in my palm.  Maybe it's just the shape of my hand instead of a design flaw?  I only deducted one star for this possibility.The bristles are high quality and the plastic piece appears of the OXO quality you'd expect.
B00004OCL3 I bought this a couple weeks ago to use to scrub up some stains out of our carpet and it has worked wonderfully. And while the bristles are delicate enough to not destroy a carpet, they are also robust enough to use to scrub a shower, sink or tub - I've used it for all of these. This is a bit more expensive than other bargain scrub brushes you might find, but the ergonomic grip really is worth it. If you are going to be using this for any extended period of time, your hands and wrist will feel the difference.
B00004OCL3 I've used this scrub on many occasions to clean grimes and scums on my bathroom tiles.  I highly prefer this OXO product over similar items you'd find in supermarket's cleaning aisle section.  The handle is comfortable and the bristles are stiff.  It has good ergonomic design and makes a tedious job bearable.  Highly recommended.
B00004OCL3 I have always kept a hefty scrub brush around for I have an old kitty that loves to toss up her dinner occasionally, plus a young puppy that often feels left out and follows suit.  Scrub brushes are easy to find and probably never considered here much on Amazon.  But trust me when I tell you that not only is this a terrific brush, but it is also very hard to find in stores.  The power behind this baby is its contoured plum like handle that sits directly on top.  It gives you maximum comfort for your hand while directing the brushes where you want without you getting tired and the brushes just slipping lightly over the stain.  The handle and the brushes are of a great quality and and I bought two for different parts of the house.  Definitely a vast improvement over the usual handles we all are used to seeing on brushes like this, and at a very fair price here on Amazon. The best, and highly recommended...
B00004OCL3 This brush works very well on grimy shower floors and tile.  It has very strong bristles and I think for some people it would be ergonomically sound, but for me it is a little uncomfortable to hold.  Cleans very well though!
B00004OCL3 Seller was efficient and product is excellent, seems like industrial strength...not one of the kitchen brushes I bought in the past from the local Target that wore out quickly.
B00004OCL3 This scrub brush is so comfortable to hold and does a great job getting things clean fast. I've used it on the shower/tub, tile floor, carpet, sink - pretty much everywhere. I don't enjoy cleaning, so might as well make it as comfortable, easy and fast as possible.
B00004OCL3 Sturdy, grippy, grippable even with wet hands, and not TOO big (gotta get in corners and other tight spaces, after all!) I am very pleased with another OXO product -- they've got a good design team, and generally, their products are not only fairly priced, but outperform others both in use and ergonomically!
B00004OCL3 OXO makes very sturdy and well built items, this is no different. A great strong brush with a great grip for deep cleaning.
B00004OCL3 I really enjoy cleaning vegetables with this brush.  The handle is easy to grip and the entire shape of the brush feels designed to really apply scrubbing action on the vegetables, compared with the more common donut shaped brushes. I use it on all all root vegetables as well as stalk vegetables such as celery as well as cabbages and brussels sprouts.  I also use it to clean apples as well. Also like the fact that I can put it into the dishwasher.  Will buy this brush again.
B00004OCL3 This is a wonderful scrub brush. I actually just used it to rush my front door screen and it really did the job. I usually have to wash the screen as well as brush it, but this makes a more thorough attack on the dirt and dust.
B00004OCL3 After reading the reviews, and recognizing the quality of OXO, I thought I had made a good decision. I was in for a surprise. I have one of those old tubs with some soap build up that is difficult to remove. With a little elbow grease, and with this superb brush, the soap scum is gone. Good grief, what a surprise. For years I have been trying to get that stuff off.  I am now going to scrub my stair carpet. Somehow, coffee stains have ingrained themselves into the rug.The raised handle keeps my hands and fingers above the brush, which makes it so much easier to use your full force. Thecontoured handle gives me a strong grasp for vigorous cleaning. The handle is nonslip, wet or dry. It is great for cleaning a variety of surfaces, from tile to carpet. There are two types of bristles for the optimum scrub. I have never found anything better for scrubbing out those darn spots!Highly Recommended. prisrob 02-08-14
B00004OCL3 Heavy duty, I have bought scrub brushes before for floor spills and none have worked like this.. Tough and great for every day use if you need it
B00004OCL3 I just LOVE this brush.  Not only does it &#34;feel good&#34; to the hand, but it's design allows you to easily get into the rounded corners of the bathtub whereas a flat, rectangular shaped brush made rounded areas difficult to clean.  The non-slip rubber grip is a plus as well.  I'm really happy with this purchase.  Will buy again when I need a replacement.  Have been using it for over 10 months and it shows no signs of wear.  Very satisfied.
B00004OCL3 I had one of this brush already, but wanted another for outside. I use my inside one to clean tubs and shower tile mainly, and anything else that needs the work of its sturdy bristles. I use the outside one for dirty or mucky shoes, and to clean out our two flat, rectangular bird feeders that hang outside in the weather. If it rains or snows, the feeders get pretty nasty inside on the bottom, but we like them as they allow the birds, squirrels and chipmunks to all be able get into the trays to eat.
B00004OCL3 OXO has made another great scrub brush here with this one for me!  I love the ergonomical handle that seems to reduce the fatigue that I would often experience when scrubbing with many of my other scrub brushes, especially in the shower - and it protects your knuckles from the banging that often happens with other brushes as well.I really appreciate the fact that this brush has bristles that are stiff enough to clean and scrub the tiles and grout in the bathroom to get them to a nice sparkle, yet soft enough to feel comfortable to use this on my bathroom vanity countertops without fear of scratching.  This brush is the perfect size for so many chores both in and out of the house - in the bathroom, the kitchen, the garage, cleaning tile floors, scrubbing outside windows, etc...This even works excellent for use when washing the cars at home to make the tires on the cars (the black rubber part) come so clean that they look brand new again; spray on a little Armor-All after and they are showroom ready!
B00004OCL3 Love the handle, really good control. Not so wild about how stiff it is - just a tad much for the carpet I want to use it on. But hubby says it'll break in and be ideal.
B00004OCL3 Scrubs scrubs and scrubs! Perfect for all those hard to reach places and perfect in the hand of all cleaners!
B00004OCLJ This is a great bottle washer, which I purchased to wash the glass drinking bottles that I purchaser here at Amazon.  Does a great job -- what more can I say.
B00004OCLJ This bottle brush is great. We bought it for washing things like water bottles and glasses. It might be hard to see in the picture but the blue part of the brush sticks out a little and it more flat to help get all the corners of whatever you're cleaning. Also the grippy part is easy to hold on to and the neck of the brush is long enough for everything I've used it on. I'm always happy with OXO products and this one is no exception.I highly recommend this.
B00004OCLJ No kitchen should be without one of these.  This has replaced my two other dish and bottle scrubbers.  I now use this when washing dishes almost exclusively since it gets down into glasses and cleans the inside of them very easily.  I pop it into the dishwasher when I run it. It is flexible enough to get into anything but still sturdy enough to get the job done fast and easy. Works well on dishes too so it's not just strictly for bottles but for anything in the kitchen.  Nice long handle also. I wish I had found this years ago.
B00004OCLJ This is a great little bottle brush. Stiff enough to get the job done, but also flexible enough to get into small spaces.
B00004OCLJ My old brush got all smashed together and had this sort of bald spot in the middle and could no longer reach a spot in the bottom of my coffee cup, so I bought this one.  I wanted to like it, but it's so soft that it doesn't really scrub the spot on my coffee cup either.
B00004OCLJ Mine arrived flattened on 2 sides from packaging, but after it got wet it sprang back to its normal shape. It works fine. It went in my narrow-mouth water bottles even though it didn't look like it would. It went in wet but not when it was dry. The opening on my bottle is barely over 1\" (about 1 1/16\")Base Brands 16-Ounce Reduce WaterWeek Bottle, Set of 5
B00004OCLJ Nice soft bristles fit well into small spaces like bottles with small mouths. This is one of my favorite bottle brushes.
B00004OCLJ Flexible, bendable neck that fits into tight spots.  But not big/wide enough for drinking glasses unless you want to move it around the perimeter.  Not much more I can say about it!
B00004OCLJ I have used this brush for years for cleaning my Vitamix Super 5000 Blender Container Blades. The bristles are flexible yet strong enough to withstand repeated assault from the very sharp stainless steel Vitamix Blades. Not a single bristle has been cut by the blades and those blades are really sharp. It works great for glass tumblers and smoothies cups too. It is durable and everlasting.
B00004OCLJ the other brushes we've tried were too hard and didn't offer enough flex to really clean. These bristles are perfect and get our bottles and sippy cups much cleaner.
B00004OCLJ i have tried many brands and types of bottle brush and now i finally found the one.this brush is just enough soft and flexible to clean bottles well. The bristles are soft and yet sturdy to withstand pressure. Unlike rubber/silicone based brush whose bristles have no strength to stand straight, this will easily clean corner without having to jam the brush into the corner.Another good feature is the lenght, it is around a foot long, so you can use it to clean your vacuum flask/thermos easily as well.
B00004OCLJ I'm picky about everything I buy, including cleaning utensils.  I want the best--something that works well and isn't expensive--so I do a lot of research.  This bottle brush works great!  I mainly use it for my Kleen Kanteen water bottles.  The brush fits through the bottleneck.  It is very flexible so it also cleans the underside of the top curved portion of the bottle (hope that makes sense).  Will not try another bottle brush.
B00004OCLJ I generally hate the OXO good grips products, but I have to admit that this is a decent brush - especially when you consider how awful some of the competing bottle brushes are.This brush is easy to clean and doesnt smell bad.(I had other brushes that stank after I used them once or twice, so this is a big issue for me)If they made the bristles stiffer I'd like this product better.  It would clean more effectively if it had stiffer bristles.
B00004OCLJ I have stopped buying cheap brushes, they don't do the job and I have to buy them often. The OXO brushes do what I ask and last a very long time. Will continue to invest in good cleaning supplies bc I will be cleaning till I die
B00004OCLJ soft for the skin very good for large bottles with wide neck. I am using normally to wash my thermo and is really good and easy to use. you dont need to put too much efford using it. good material and durable construction. Recommended
B00004OCLJ Not only does it clean the stainless steel bottles I just purchased, but it is a great addition to my sink. I've been using it to wash glasses, scrub plates, etc. I love the way it flexes into the grooves and the fit in my hand. Highly recommend.
B00004OCLJ Just what I expected, great product that is really nice on the hand and easy to use. This thing shourld
B00004OCLJ It is surprisingly hard to find a brush like this. I just wanted it to be able to clean my travel mugs really well. I don't like putting them in the dishwasher and a sponge does not reach everywhere. This is a great brush for a good price. I have been using it for about a year and it still looks great, the bristles do not wear easily so I think it will last for a long time. I am now able to reach all those touch spots in my travel mugs, carafes, and vases.
B00004OCLJ We bought this brush initially to clean baby bottles, but it fast became our go to brush for cleaning anything tall & round  (water bottles, travel coffee mugs, glasses, vases).  Bristles are soft so they won't scratch or damage anything, but powerful enough to also get things clean.  We love the flexible neck too as we can clean things that are slightly curved and this brush doesn't get stuck in anything!  Love it!
B00004OCLJ This does a great job of washing the inside of bottles. The slightly flexible neck and bristles at the top make it very effective at its job. Only thing is sometimes it's tricky getting little food particles from between the bristles when you're finished cleaning (it can look kind of gross!)
B00004OCLJ I finally got my old Nalgene bottle cleaned out that has been hiding at the back of my cupboard with this great brush. I thought the bottle WAS clean until I saw that the slightly cloudy film that was on the very bottom was not there anymore. I couldn't be happier knowing that I won't be drinking anymore germs or excess cleaning products that failed to rinse. When this one wears out I will purchase another.
B00004OCLJ I like this brush better than another one I had that was just too stiff to really do a good job getting into corners. This one gets into corners just fine. It does seem to pick up stains easily. I run it through the dishwasher to help keep it clean.
B00004OCLJ It's a good sturdy brush, bends well, fits in what I need it for, but the bristles are only slightly rougher than a generic bottle brush. I use it clean glass bottles I fill with juice (from a juicer), and it doesn't get anything stuck on. It also stains easy. However, the grip is comfortable and it's a good length for 16oz glass bottles, and if you can find a different way to get things unstuck, it works just fine. I just wish it was rougher and a little longer wouldn't hurt. It does the job but aside from real sturdiness it's not much better than a generic brush.
B00004OCLJ I bought this along with OXOs travel coffee mug. Cleans out mug well as well as other dishes. All the bristles are soft so if you want a hard scrubber pass on this.
B00004OCLJ Got this for cleaning out sport bottles and stainless thermal coffee cups.  Flexible.  The bristles are not very dense and the bristle material is very light.  This is NOT a scrub brush, and I actually have concerns about how long the lightweight nylon bristles will hold up over time, but this gets the job done.  The brush will fit into anything the width of the wand portion at the top, because the bristles are so soft, they flatten out and flow (almost like wet hair...).
B00004OCLJ Very sleek look and great grip on this bottle brush. Simple, yet effective, doesn't have that cheap look or performance that some do. All-in-all; great brush!
B00004OCLJ Best bottle brush I have used.  Just wish the bristles were a bit stiffer.  However, because the bristles are soft, they easily get into corners.  I rehab wild birds and I use this to clean water containers.  The handle and wand are flexible, comfortable to use.
B00004OCLJ I bought this brush to wash glass bottles we bought at the same time and I'm so glad I did!Aquasana AQ-6005 18-Ounce Glass Water Bottles, 6-Pack
B00004OCLJ I use this brush every day to clean my Vita-Mix after making my morning protein shake. I have large hands that don't fit inside normal size glasses so I use it for all things tall and slim.
B00004OCLJ When you have bottles and you juice a lot, you need bottle cleaners.  This brush is much better than the previous ones I have owned.  This gets down inside and is sturdy yet flexible enough to bend within the bottle to clean those hard to get to places.Love it.
B00004OCLJ I use this brush everyday. I use it to clean out thermos, the coffee pot, canning jars anything that needs cleaning. Wish I had purchased a second. One day I will get on here and remember to buy myself a couple of spares.
B00004OCLJ Great design, very poor execution. The bristles are so soft that the brush deforms if you leave it in the sink. Doesn't clean my stainless coffee carafe thoroughly.
B00004OCLJ I bought this to clean my nalgene Titan bottle 1000ml. It's perfect. Must have for anyone with a reusable bottle.
B00004OCLJ This brush is the perfect size for cleaning our Contigo Coffee mugs ( not the lid just the mug ).  It holds soap surprisingly well and has proven durable over the last few months.  The handle has a nice rubber feel and the brush is flexible.
B00004OCLJ I have always struggled cleaning my tea pot and my Nalgene water bottles.  I would stuff washcloths into them and spin them around but I never felt like I was doing a good job.  I saw this cheap little brush on amazon and figured I'd give it a go.  This brush helps me all the time now.  It can squeeze into the holes my hand can't fit in and I can move it around and scrub the insides.  I am impressed with this brush and am very glad I found it.
B00004OCLJ Decent brush for price, but Walmart has a better brush for less money. It's up to you. If Walmart is close, get it there, if not, then amazon. Decently manufactured. Hey. It's a brush.
B00004OCLJ it is a good brush for bottles and hard to clean stuff.only downside I found is the end flattens out quickly so if you need to scrub the bottom of something hard, you will need something else after a few uses with this.
B00004OCLJ After trying anther more expensive bottle brush that had a weak handle that made it hard to clean with, I was very pleased to find this one does not have that problem.  It is about a foot long, with a nice rubber grip and a very strong handle and quality construction, Soft bristles that clean well.  Overall very good and a great value.
B00004OCLJ First of all let me say I have only used this brush for water bottles.  We have purchased many bottle brushes just to get them home and not work for all our water bottles.  This one does! It is long, thin and it's bristles aren't so hard they won't budge.  This is also a high quality brush.  Overall, it actually did the job of a bottle brush and did it well! You won't regret purchasing this!
B00004OCLJ This brush fits into bottles very easily, and does a really good job for things that are not dried on, it's not quite as effective for gunkier/dried on things, but filling the bottle with water and letting it soak first helps.
B00004OCLJ Works well but I wish it's bristles were a touch harder and there were more of them. But it does work pretty well anyway.
B00004OCLJ This is an nicely sized bottle brush, but I found the bristles to be a tad too soft to be effective against day-old dried milk in the bottle
B00004OCLJ This is astoundingly dishwasher tolerant. It has emerged unscathed from the top rack of my dishwasher after pots and pans wash, 6 or 7 times already.Initially, I bought this to clean my tall ello glass water bottle with a narrow opening.  Now I use it on all hand wash serving and glassware.  The bristles are effectively scrub-y, are high quality soft nylon that doesn't scratch glass and collapses to fit into narrow mouth jars and bottles.  The handle is hand injury friendly with typical soft OXO comfort with appropriate density for a secure grip. A+
B00004OCLJ The handle is thin enough to get into &#34;Sport Cap&#34; style water bottles. The bristles are soft, so they will not scratch plastic or steel -- meaning no where for bacteria to grow or smells to move in.Be advised: Don't let this dry on it's side. The Bristles are so soft that they'll become permanantly smooshed.
B00004OCLJ I usually avoid OXO products, not always but when I can. They're too rubbery for me. This works fine though. My wife makes our peanut butter and the empty jars are hard to clean out to reuse. This makes it very easy.
B00004OCLJ For the price I paid, this is an excellent item to have in the kitchen. But the quality of Oxo's Buttle Brush is excellent. Good job Oxo
B00004OCLJ I use this brush a lot. I take a thermos to work most days, and this is perfect for cleaning it out. The bristles are kind of soft, flexible, and it cleans so well. I love it.
B00004OCLJ I really love this water brush. We drink all of our water out of glass bottles in an effort to get away from petro chemicals leaching out of plastic water bottles. This brush does a great job of making the job of washing all of these bottles very easy.
B00004OCLJ I bought this brush to clean out the back of my coffee maker as well as my soda stream bottles.  It does the trick - collapses down to get into corners and into the bottles and then fans right back out.  Certainly does the trick.  I just keep it in my dishwasher and pull it out when I'm cleaning those hard to clean items.
B00004OCLJ This bottle brush has a flexible handle and even fits into bottles with very small spouts (1\" or 1.5\", I'm not sure).  I use this to clean out my bottles weekly and am very happy with this purchase.  I chose to purchase this specific bottle brush because it is so highly-reviewed.  I bought this to replace a former bottle-brush, whose bristles were attached to the stem with wire (so they got bent out of shape).  I really prefer this one, it cleans so well, stays clean, and seems indestructible!
B00004OCLJ I needed something stronger for my needs. I still like OXO but this one didn't do it for me. Drop me a line if you find one on the interwebs.
B00004OCLJ I give it 4 stars because I feel like it should be a little stiffer.  It cleans the bottle and the shaft is the right length but I just don't get the scrub action I like.
B00004OCLJ I now use it to wash cups, bottle, all sorts of containers as well.Great flexible brush.
B00004OCLJ we originally purchased a bottle brush at Wal Mart, but they only carried brushes for cleaning baby bottles. This turned out to be completely useless, so I purchased the OXO brush from Amazon. It is a well made product that is long enough to clean inside my half-gallon glass milk containers. Another useful kitchen tool to make life easier.
B00004OCLJ I needed a bottle brush for my water bottles that I take to work and to the gym. This product is just right.  It has the perfect length and the brush bristles aren't to coarse.
B00004OCLJ The brush is good quality & does fine for glasses & baby bottles. I, unfortunately, bought it to use to clean swing top bottles that I use for kifir soda. It will not fit through the opening. I decided on this one after another reviewer said that they used it to clean beer bottles. Their bottles must have larger openings than mine.
B00004OCLJ I use this for everything--bottles and glasses & coffee cups and mugs also.  Milk that has dried in bottom on glass or coffee rings in cups and mugs.  Use this brush to swish that stuff out before loading in dishwasher.
B00004OCLJ CAUTION! DOES NOT CLEAN A 32 Oz. Real Lemon Type of Narrow Bottleneck and Similar Bottles! Peanut Butter Jar and similar type does work well. Basically any size BOTTLENECK OVER 1 inch in diameter. I still have to rely on my old partially rusted wired brush bendable bottle cleaner.
B00004OCLJ I put tea in my metal water bottles and the residue builds up rapidly.  Just rinsing doesn&#8217;t help and I decided I&#8217;d purchase the OXO bottle brush.  With a quick whirl around the inside of the bottle, it swiped that tea residue out in a second.  I was very pleased and tried it on several other things that needed a bit of cleaning.  I simply left the brush to soak after I was done and it still looks like new.FEATURES:&#9658;  Durable neck flexes for easy reach inside bottles, pitchers and carafes&#9658;  Ideal for sauce jars, baby bottles, vases and tall glasses&#9658;  Stiffer bristles clean hard-to-reach corners&#9658;  Safe for crystal and stemware&#9658; Tackles multiple tasks with two types of bristles&#9658; Flexible neck makes getting into hard spots easy&#9658;  Rounded head is perfect fit for bottles and narrow jars&#9658;  Nonslip handle, wet or dry&#9658;  Perfect for gentle cleaning or vigorous scrubbing&#9658;  Dishwasher safeI even tried using it in the dish drainer for those hard to reach corners that always seem to have a little grimy buildup.  Worked like a charm, but it did soil the brush a bit.  I simply put a bit of bleach in some sudsy water and it immediately came clean.  Then I rinsed it well and dried it.  I was expecting a stiff brush, but instead got one that was soft, but just stiff enough to do those tricky jobs.  Really pleased with this purchase.
B00004OCLJ It's hard to find a good bottle brush and a good price, and this is it.  It fits into narrow bottles and the bristles are soft enough not to scratch.
B00004OCLJ Since I received this brush, I have put ALL OTHER BRUSHES UNDER THE SINK; This one cleans very tall bottles and carafes and vacuum bottles; built study, therefore no need for all the other brushes I wasted money purchasing.
B00004OCLJ This has softer bristles that won't scratch your glassware.  I have had it for quite awhile, and the bristles are still in good condition - no bending or flattening.  Only complaint which cost a star is that the bristles have discolored (probably from my berry smoothies), and I cannot get them white again even with a bleach-containing cleaner.
B00004OCLJ I don't think you could find a better bottle brush than this one.  As with all OXO products, it has a soft grip.  It has a somewhat flexible shaft with a well designed set of bristles.  I have neuropathy, which makes it hard for me to grip many items but the OXO soft grip works perfectly.I am quite pleased with the OXO bottle brush and would highly recommend it to you.
B00004OCLJ This is wonderful to use to clean all of my glasses and bottles. Works great! Made very well. Good quality.
B00004OCLJ What more can one say?  Every OXO I have purchased has been great and this is no exception.  Good little bottle washer
B00004OCLJ I use this to clean out all sorts of cups and bottles and it always maintains its shape.  Been using it for almost a year now and its still going strong.  Its really only for light cleaning though because the brush bristles are too soft to do much scrubbing, but they are the right softness to easily squish into a small bottle opening, which is what I bought it for.  I'd buy it again with the knowledge that its just a light duty brush specifically for water bottles/jugs.
B00004OCLJ This is one of my favorite bottle brushes because the bristles are soft and evenly dispersed, including the tip of the brush where we need to reach into corners, crevices and bottoms of vessels such as thermoses, carafes, baby bottles, wine and drinking glasses without scratching their surfaces. The handle is sturdy and won't bend like wire-made brushes.  I recommend this brush.
B00004OCLJ A good bottle brush is a necessity for cleaning those reusable glass bottles that I carry daily for water or juice, etc.  This is a good brush made by OXO.  The handle is comfortable and the perfect length for getting to the bottom of a large bottle or thermos.
B00004OCLJ I love this thing for cleaning my bicycle water bottles, and it's soft enough to do wine glasses, narrow cups, etc. too. I've purchased additional brushes as gifts for my biking friends. I'm still sing the original one I bought -- seems pretty durable. The handle is long enough to reach into the larger water bottles (20 oz. I think), so that's a plus.
B00004OCLJ The bottom bristles while a little stiffer than the side ones, but st
B00004OCLJ I've had this brush for a while and it's still in good shape. I love it for swishing out glasses. The bristles are a bit soft and flick water around if you're not careful but the long somewhat flexible handle is great.
B00004OCLJ We have had a couple really nice bottle brushes that have recently just given up completely and we needed replacements fast.  We looked at all the stores we regularly haunt, but did not find anything of a satisfactory type and quality.  So online I went and found this great sounding brush and decided to give it a tryout, so far it has performed flawlessly cleaning all sizes and shapes of bottles and containers of all types as well.  Overall this has been a great purchase, and I hope they have these in the future for when this one gives up the ghost in a few years...
B00004OCLJ I stockpile these. I prefer these to sponges and these make it easy to clean the delicate glasses and the hand-trapping traveling coffee mugs/water bottles.
B00004OCLJ Bought it for cleaning the Copco cups and husband was so excited to use it for about a dozen other things. LOL. Keep peace in the house, buy 3.
B00004OCLJ This is perfect for cleaning wine glasses and water glasses. It's gentle and scrubs any residues off pretty well. Well-manufactured and easy to clean.
B00004OCLJ Can't go wrong with oxo products and this is another good one. Handle is sturdy and the bristles are soft but clean well. I've put in dishwasher and still works well.
B00004OCLJ The handle on this brush is thin and very flexible.  The bristles are very soft.  I think this brush has a purpose but did not meet my expectations.  I need something a bit more sturdy.
B00004OCLJ This bottle brush is well made and GREAT for most things, but it has a THICK stem that will NOT go into regular size water bottles, so don't buy it for that! I tried to use it on the VOSS water bottle I use (recycle,) and for spice bottles, and my sport jug - it was hopeless. You need a regular old fashioned \"baby bottle\" brush with the thin wire stem for regular drinking bottles. OR TRY this incredible brush:Way Clean 33030 Bottle Brushwhich is under four dollars AND has a thinner shaft to fit more bottles, glasses, etc, and which is SLANTED to facilitate a thorough cleaning!
B00004OCLJ This brush is the best especially to clean out small mouthed bottles of all kinds & pitchers. To me the best part of this brush is it's flexibility to reach places that normal plain brushes can't reach like unreachable cracks, crevices & bends & curved glass. This thing rocks & I am very very happy that I purchased it & I will be telling a lot of people about it because it makes cleaning pitchers, water bottles, jars & any think a breeze to clean & I most definitely am extremely satisfied with this wonderful product & wonderful seller that packaged my product so well. Go get one you will be very happy that you did so.
B00004OCLJ Looks good, especially the exuberant looking bristles at the business end. I use this with Aqua Sana glass water bottles and it's perfect. Gets every bit of the interior clean with soapy water. The handle is typically Oxo quality, it's a work of art as well as a bottle brush. Think back to old, mean-spirited, lifeless bottle brushes you used. Now look at this. Oxo GETS IT. A good tool you feel positively about it worth the effort, you know?
B00004OCLJ It has not started falling apart like so many of these brushes do. The handle is comfortable and has a good grip to it.
B00004OCLJ Bought this to give a good clean to wide-mouthed bottles (actually the inside of the water reservoir of my coffee machine). Great for this. Head has many bristles at many angles. Might not work for very narrow bottles.
B00004OCLJ As far as bottle brushes go, this works like a charm.  My old brush was getting too gross so it was time for a replacement.  Of course, I checked my local store and found nothing worthwhile so I logged onto Amazon and found this brush.  It's so nice to know you can find whatever you need online and purchase it with \"one click\"...lol!
B00004OCLJ I bought this for cups, glasses, and bottles (we have a baby).  But it works so well I use it for bowls, forks, everything.  The only issue is that the handle slides off easily and so I just took it off.
B00004OCLJ This high quality brush has relatively soft bristles so I an use it for relatively small bottles.  However, it will not be able to fit into beer bottles.
B00004OCLJ Love it.  Another wonderful OXO product.  I have bought several of their products and so far, so good.  The price is great, too.
B00004OCLJ Needed a new bottle brush as the old one had rusted and bristles fallen off. Love the ergonomic handle, how easily it stores in a sink caddy, and how simple it is to clean.
B00004OCLJ This brush does exactly what it is supposed to do. Even My husband likes it! Can there be a higher recommendation than that?
B00004OCLJ I use this to clean thermoses and oddly shaped drink lids/food storage container lids. The brush works well partially because it is soft and pliable. The strands are long, but bend and push into small crevices and hard to reach areas that stiffer bristles can't touch. Simple little tool, but it works.
B00004OCLJ This is a reasonably nice brush with a good handle.  However we would like something similar with a longer handle.  Why do they stop at 12-13&#34;
B00004OCLJ I researched this brush before buying as I have done on all my purchases. This particular brush has softer brittles and therefore flexible into getting in the tight surfaces. This is great for wine glasses, mugs, and in general surfaces like bowls. I had a previousw brush similar to this, but not flexible... You will not be sorry. Hope this helps.
B00004OCLJ I bought this to clean my new 64 oz clean canteen.  I make fruit and vegtable smoothies to bring to work.  I needed a better brush to clean it out.  This fits the bill perfectly.
B00004OCLJ Fantastic tool for washing my water bottles after leaving the gym. Easy to use and rinse. Definitely worth the purchase.
B00004OCLJ It is the right length and width for cleaning those hard to get at travlers mugs that are too thin for most of the scrubbers I had. This worked perfect. I also bought one for a friend who agrees it works great.
B00004OCLJ I love scrubbing classes and bottles and what ever you got that needs a long handle brush for some good quality scrubbing. The bristles are a little weak, they could be sturdier.
B00004OCLJ Works for me!  It was just what I wanted.  I would order it again when I need one along with the sink brushes.
B00004OCLJ This a a very nice light, and soft bottle brush.  It is well constructed. Not musch else to say other than it derserves five stars.
B00004OCLJ This is perfect! I have always used a baby bottle brush to clean my Camelbak water  bottles, and I never found one long enough until this one. It's Oxo so it's sturdy and good quality and it really reaches the bottom of the bottle. You get in every nook and cranny. Highly recommend!
B00004OCLJ I have had this for a while now and it still works great. It is especially helpful for water bottles with small openings.
B00004OCLJ This brush works perfect to clean out my favorite glass bottles.  Does exactly what it should for a good price.
B00004OCLJ I needed a way to clean the bottom of my soda stream bottles and this brush fits the bill. The soda stream bottles have a thin neck so I was happy that the brush had no problem fitting in and reaching the bottom.Its a brush. Not really that much you need to know.
B00004OCLJ We use this to clean our water bottles and wine glasses and it works great!OXO products are durable, comfortable to use, and last!
B00004OCLJ This is a great bottle cleaner. It cleans well and works well with a varied size bottles!  Keep your bottles clean and bacteria free with this brush!
B00004OCLJ I bought this to clean narrow mouth water bottles and coffee mugs.  Gets the job done, haven't had any problems.
B00004OCLJ I really have no complaints about this bottle brush.  It is only that I have discovered another brand of brush which I like better than the OXO brush.
B00004OCLJ I shouldn't have waited. These are essential for thoroughly cleaning out your Nalgenes and Kleen Kanteens. The Kleen Kanteens are tough without a solution like this. I just couldn't get the tea and coffee stains out. I should have bought this sooner just like the other reviewers said. Oh well - have one now - I'm pleased and highly recommend.
B00004OCLJ I saw some people in these reviews complaining that the brush is too short for their purposes -- I don't know what they're cleaning with this brush, but all the thermoses and bottles I've used it on have cleaned out quite nicely and easily. The bristles are firm but pliable, and the handle is (like all OXO products) ergonomic and easy to hold onto.
B00004OCLJ It does the job, so I shouldn't complain.  I just wish the bristles were a little bit stiffer to help really scrub the bottles and such.  Overall I like it, but it's not the end-all be-all of bottle brushes.And the reviews indicating that it is not for smaller openings... that's a load of garbage.  It can basically fit into an inch opening... not sure what on earth they were doing.
B00004OCLJ I am becoming an OXO Superfan simply because their products meet most of my kitchen needs fully.  Of those OXO products I have, not one has failed and each has performed as advertised, but with more effectiveness than I expected based on their modest prices.  I bought this brush mainly to accompany a 6-pack of 18 ounce glass water bottles that would be hard to reach without a bristle brush.  In goes the OXO and out comes the unwanted material.  Luckily, the contents have been nothing but water and nothing else that we know of.  A simple and effective brush goes a long way around here and we highly recommend this one.
B00004OCLJ If your looking for a brush to clean bottles I would say get this brush. This is also good to clean big cups.
B00004OCLJ Though this brush was too big in diameter to fit the item I bought to clean, I kept is for possible future used in cleaning items such as pitchers in the kitchen.
B00004OCLJ Great for reaching inside bottles that are typically impossible to scrub, and general cleaning for any dishes you may have.
B00004OCLJ Drinking coffee continuously every day eventually runs a mark on all thermos canisters that one may have or use. Quick to the chase, this was my issue with drinking coffee and having to clean the Thermos canister every now and then was usually a time consuming nightmare.It is quite difficult to clean these canisters usually because water splashing and detergent isn't enough on its own. Using my hands to clean dirty materials is normally always the way I go about to clean something in need of clearing out but doing so for incredibly small and hollow canisters is &#34;impossible&#34; to do with hands alone.My hands are way too big to come close to fitting inside the small canister tops and I didn't know what I could use to scrub that coffee build up found inside the canisters. Quick enough, I find this simple product on Amazon and place an order. In just 2 simple days (Amazon Prime Membership), I have the OXO Bottle brush and wow! It squeezes through the tightest hollow canisters and easily brushes up any buildup of stains or particles that may be sticking to the inside of the container.In combination with the Urnex Clearly Coffee Liquid Coffee Pot Cleaner item also on Amazon and this OXO Bottle brush, your cleaning duties for the remaining of a living and drinking coffee life are now simplified! No more struggles with getting a perfect clean canister. Drink with satisfaction and ease of mind and purchase this brush!Brush feels durable and has a nice array and structure of cleaning threads. Comes topped with a rubbish grip for the lower handle and operates with ease for any inexperienced user. I feel like with proper care, this shall last for a lifetime.
B00004OCLJ The most  fascinating thing about this brush the the sturd but extremely &#34;soft feel&#34; bristles.  And more surprisingly, I find my self using it for almost all dishwashing tasks -- except from anyithing calling for more than light &#34;scrubbing&#34;.
B00004OCLJ Not sure what kind of bottles oxo is using as the basis of this bottle brush, but it is too big. I was concerned the handle wouldn't be long enough to let me get to the bottom of my bottles, but it doesn't even get past the super fat tip that the bristles are attached to.
B00004OCLJ This bottle brush works really well. I like the handle, it provides a good grip. the bristles are soft, but firm enough to clean cups really well.
B00004OCLJ Much improved design over their older or other bottle cleaner.  This brush has a nice thick yet flexible handle to allow you to clean your bottles without fear of snapping off the head.
B00004OCLJ This is one of the brushes by my sink that I use the most.  It works very well as intended and I found even some more uses for it.  I may order a second one.
B00004OCLJ The bristles on this brush are soft as it is not really heavy duty cleaning brush , however I use it to clean my tassimo water tank where nothing else fit thanks to the worthless design of it , but the brush do the job as well , also use for cleaning my coffee thermos
B00004OCLJ I use this brush to clean narrow-necked, glass bottles; stainless-steel, sports water bottles; glass carafes; and 16-ounce, tall, water glasses that are too narrow for my hand to fit inside.This has a really nice rubber grip. The bristles are firm enough to clean well, but not so hard they aren't flexible.Highly recommended!
B00004OCLJ I was a lot of water bottles and this brush makes it so easy. Now I don't have to worry about anything getting stuck in there and I'm not able to wash it out
B00004OCLJ This brush is awesome. I use it all the time on dishes, glasses and my sink. My other one is still usable but worn after lots of use. You can't go wrong with it.
B00004OCLJ Great bottle brush for our household with three kids who all play sports.  So we are constantly washing water bottles that come home from games and practices.  This brush is perfect for cleaning these bottles.  (And I imagine it would work just as well for baby bottles.)  My only complaint is that the bristles compress or collapse over time, so I find I have to replace this brush about every 3 or 4 months.  I always buy the same one again, but I wish it lasted a bit longer!
B00004OCLJ This was just what I needed. I was worried at first, because the bristles weren't very stiff, but they still did the job JUST perfectly.  I don't know why I went so long without a bottle brush!
B00004OCLJ I bought this to get the inside of wine glasses and other glasses clean.  I was very happy to find that they just barely fit into my champagne flutes.  good brush.
B00004OCLJ I bought the Bormioli Rocco Sorgente cooler glasses earlier this year - they are lovely but they are narrow glasses and because of their shape, it's very hard to get my hand and sponge down far enough to clean the bottoms.  This bottle brush does the trick.  Also use it to clean wine glasses.
B00004OCLJ This really is the best brush out there for cleaning baby bottles.  It has held up perfectly after 11 months of daily use.
B00004OCLJ works fine for water bottles and mason jars. it's softer than i prefer, but it still manages to clean what needs to be cleaned.
B00004OCLJ I bought this hoping that it would be long enough to reach the bottom of my 27 oz Klean Kanteen and it works great! The bristles are soft but they get the job done.
B00004OCLJ This brush is great for cleaning my Thermos - which often smells when I leave coffee in it for too long. However, this brush takes the smell away instantly. Plus, unlike many sponges,this brush does not ever get moldy or smelly.  I have not tried it with other types of bottles and containers but I assume it works just as well!
B00004OCLJ I was sitting on the fence between getting this bottle brush an the other one that had two other attachments. I went way from that one because I read that it was almost two feet long. Too long.  This brush is really good. Bristles are soft enough to bend to allow the brush to go through a smaller openings yet firm enough to get the corners. Good product.
B00004OCLJ This is a very solid bottle brush.  The bristles are soft, and more importantly, are solidly attached.  The brush I owned before kept shedding its bristles everywhere.  The handle is solid too.  No danger of falling off.This brush is JUST long enough for my 12-ish inch Nissan thermos.  It's a bit hard to clean the bottom because the thermos' mouth opening is fairly small and the whole brush pretty much disappears inside.  But, it works.
B00004OCLJ I use these to clean sippy cups on a daily basis and they are a great product. They work very well and I will continue to buy these.
B00004OCLJ I'm not sure why this has such good reviews.  It works decently for the sides of the bottle but the top bristles quickly flatten and it does not get the bottom of  bottles clean.  I would spend more money for a better brush.
B00004OCLJ This has become the best brush I've ever had to clean everything I've got in my kitchen! It cleans in all corners.
B00004OCLJ This is a good quality brush. This brand is a very good budget Buy. Brush cleans well and holds its shape without the bristles becoming stubs with use. Good quality at a good value. Recommend.
B00004OCLJ I bought one at Bed Bath and Beyond YEARS ago and it just now went.  But I use it actually to clean the walls of shower and shower doors so that nothing scratches it.  yes it works great as a bottle brush as now my new one I use for dishes and the old one in the bathroom.
B00004OCLJ Really nice product, it reaches the bottom of long bottles and easy to clean. At this price it's a steal!.
B00004OCLJ This is a really good brush but I was surprised at how soft the bristles ended up being. So far it works great but I'm wondering how it will hold up to tough grim. Brush arrived on time and packaged well. If you don't mind softer bristles, I would recommend this item and seller.
B00004OCLJ OXO makes the best things.  This is the right size to fit into smaller mouth bottles.  The length is perfect as well.
B00004OCLJ I bought 2 more of this after my first brush.  The first brush is still holding up after a few years use in kitchen.  I will buy this again when I need more.
B00004OCLJ Got this for cleaning out Nalgene bottles. The brush and long handle is perfect sized for that job and will also work for many other applications where you need a long handle. The handle is slightly flexible so that is useful for getting a better angle for cleaning.
B00004OCLJ Softer bristles than expected, but seems to work well.  It's actually larger than I imagined, but works well.  Wouldn't hesitate to recommend this product.
B00004OCLJ I received this last week.  I bought it to clean jars and glasses.  Does not feel flimsy, does a good job.  The last two bottle cleaners I bought in the grocery store were of appalling quality.  This is in a whole different class.. it works!  I expect to feel the same way next month.June 2012:  This little miracle lasted for more than a YEAR.  I finally retired the first one two months ago and am now using the second one.  Talk about value for money spent!
B00004OCLJ I bought this brush to clean the different Naglene bottles I have, I really wanted something to clean myNALGENE Tritan 1-Quart Narrow Mouth BPA-Free Water Bottlethe one with the Narrow mouth, this brush works perfectly.  Fits down the neck and you can bend it to clean all spots of the bottle.Came packaged really well, box was oversized and lots of padding which made for no bristle damage at all.
B00004OCLJ Every morning I take a 16oz insulated thermos bottle into work with tea, coffee, yerba mate, juice, or something similar. My hands can't fit in any of my bottles. Most dishwashers aren't powerful enough to shoot water to the back of a thermos if it's in the dishwasher at and angle. This bottle brush is able to quickly, and easily clean the inside of any bottle. And for just $5, every bottle should get a decent cleaning once in awhile!Vinyl bristles are nice, don't deteriorate, hold soap well, and have just the right amount of flexibility to be stuffed into a bottle-top but just enough rigidity to get cemented-grime off bottle-walls.Hope that helps!
B00004OCLJ Bigger than a baby bottle brush but strangely more useful.  This brush is not going to fit into a bottle that can be sealed with a cork. It is however great for Nalgene type water bottles, teapots, bread tubes, the medium size aluminum thermoses (?) thermi (?).  It reigned victorious in  both its duel against the aging chef wizard thingy and an accidental spin (handle first) in the garbage disposal.
B00004OCLJ no need to smash your hand into a cup again.good quality like all OXO products.1 2 3 4
B00004OCLJ Good construction. Functions like any decent bottle brush should. Had it for a few weeks and it hasn't fallen apart or anything.
B00004OCLJ Great product!  Cleans the 1-liter bottles for the Soda Stream machine nicely. Is well made, and I imagine will last some time. A great product!
B00004OCLJ Sometimes a little thing makes a big difference and having the right tool for the job is one of those things.  I use a meat grinder several times a week to make pet food for cats and make sausages for myself. This requires scrupulous attention to cleanliness.  One of the parts was a little hard to clean on the inside, but this bottle brush makes the job a breeze.  It is both flexible enough to easily clean the interior, while the bristles are soft enough not to scratch the metal.  I also found it to be an excellent tool for cleaning the square glass containers that I use to store milk in the refrigerator.  As you know square kitchen containers can be tricky to clean.  This brush is long enough for half gallon containers, but it could be a little short for larger containers.  For my purposes, this brush would have been a good purchase at twice the price.
B00004OCLJ I have many OXO products.  They are all great quality and highly functional.  This bottle brush is no exception.  I recommend.
B00004OCLJ I love this bottle brush! It's long enough to get into our very tall 32-ounce bottles. It's sturdy enough to move it around in the bottles to get them nice and clean. The way the bristles are situated also helps get the bottles clean. I've used in glass vases and other narrow necked items and because it is so slim there are very few bottles it won't fit into. It has also lasted longer than several other bottle brushes we've tried. Very pleased!
B00004OCLJ grip handle ,bristles conform to varying shapes very easily, dishwasher safe . Ideal for baby bottles ,tall glasses, vases, flexible neck
B00004OCLJ I am going to purchase one here from Amazon. We bought one a few years back at Bed Bath & Beyond? but I can't remember. We love it.Every day we use this to wash out bottle/protein shakers, it works very well. The head of this fits into a variety of bottles well, such as re-used gatorade, iced tea, and milk bottles, baby bottles too. Not all bottle brushes fit into smaller openings well, and still able to clean the interior bottle surfaces. The shaft of it is flexible too.The bristles are just right - they are also somewhat soft, which is great. Many other bottle brushes I looked at have super stiff bristles and don't clean out things well or work as well with dish soap. The foam/sponge type bottle brushes (like for baby bottles) fall apart and get gross pretty easily.Every now and then the bristles get too dirty, well then just fill up a cup of really hot water and dish soap and wash it a bit and rinse out.This is a great price here too.
B00004OCLJ I am forever fighting with these glasses and tumblers to get them clean on the bottom.  Not anymore, this is a great cleaner!  Easy to handle with the great grip.  I wouldn't be without one anymore!
B00004OCLJ I babysit my grandson.  My daughter bought me a baby bottle brush for her Dr. B bottles that fell apart.  This one is more study and works 100% better.  I love it.
B00004OCLJ Sometimes you just need something simple.This brush is perfect for cleaning many sorts of travel cups, thermoses, bottles, vases, and other various hand-wash dishes such as little spoons. Since I've collected the spoons from around the world, I want to keep them in good shape. The OXO brush is much nicer on the spoons than the dishwasher, and the multiple angles of the bristles make it very easy to clean smaller items.I have also used the brush on hand-wash cups because it is so easy to use. The flexible stem and bunches of bristles means it almost cleans the dish itself (with soap).That said, I use it as a secondary brush most of the time, once I've scraped off any visible marks. Although the bristles are good, they are not real strong. I don't think it would scrape off dried dough, for instance.Considering the price, it may be worth it to just stock my sink with several of the OXO brushes, one for every occasion.I haven't washed the brush in the dishwasher yet, I'll let you know the results when I do.
B00004OCLJ I used a baby one before but it was not long enough.  This one is long enough and firm enough to clean all of my sports bottles.
B00004OCLJ I got this brush to wash out my many Nalgene water bottles. Nothing else really does the job quite as well. The bristles are just hard enough to clean inside the threads of the bottle lid and just soft enough not to scratch up the inside of the bottles. Before I got this brush cleaning them was a real chore. Now it's relatively easy. Highly recommended if you have narrow opening bottles to clean.
B00004OCLJ I bought this at the same time as buying a new cookie press and planned to only really use it for that.  However, I have also been using it to clean my canning jars that don't have a wide mouth and it works great for that.  The bristles are soft and won't scratch whatever you are cleaning, and the brush head fits through very small openings for difficult to clean items.
B00004OCLJ It didn't fit the bottle I bought it for, but then that bottle broke a couple of days after anyway.  I kept it because I have another glass water bottle and it is soft and flexible, yet strong enough to clean from protein shakes.
B00004OCLJ this is the first & only bottle brush i've been able to find that will fit into the narrow mouth of my water bottle AND reach all the way to the bottom!
B00004OCLJ I needed something that would reach deeper than the baby bottle brushes for water bottles, mason jars, etc. Works great.
B00004OCLJ We are using this for baby bottle brush. The bristles are just perfect in stiffness. It is easy to use as it slides smoothly in and out of  the bottle. From what I read from other reviews, this brush is also great on Nalgene water bottles.  The handle is made of rubber and very comfortable.  It is a little long compared to other brush bottles we tried before but that doesn't pose a problem at all.Overall, it is a well made brush.
B00004OCLJ The VP family purchased this brush initially to clean water bottles, but quickly discovered it also will clean the inside of our glass Chemex and the bottom of our hand wash Thermos as well. The bristles have never absorbed any odors from coffee or tea and the brush does an excellent job reaching the bottom of a 8 cup Chemex. We use organic soaps, but we do not put this brush in the dishwasher. It dries quickly and stores in our silverware drawer.
B00004OCLJ OXO is known for well designed products and this is no exception. Son and daughter in law used extensively during grandson's first year.
B00004OCLJ There aren't enough bristles and they are too soft to clean effectively.  I used it on my tea jar that gets a residue build up and I couldn't even get it all off.  I don't see it holding up for long either, seems really cheap.  I usually like OXO products, but this one is a dud.
B00004OCLJ Bought this to replace an existing (different brand) of bottle brush. I am pleased with it. It works well and cleans great. I recommend this item!
B00004OCLJ I have had this brush for over two years now and I use it constantly. The colored end bristles are a little stiffer then the white ones so it's great for the bottom of jars especially the ones you have to clean for recycling. Makes hard work a breeze. After extreme daily use it still looks brand new, I just put it in a glass with bleach and water every so often to keep it nice and fresh. I purchased two and the other one is still under the sink with the tag still on it because I just can't wear this thing out! I LOVE THIS BRUSH! I bought one for a friend who looked at me like I was insane when I raved about it and now she tells all her friends to get one too! Get this brush, it is an amazing very well made cleaning tool!
B00004OCLJ My large hands make it very difficult to wash the bottom of my insulated coffee mugs (the manufacturers recommend not putting them in the dishwasher). A regular wire core bottle brush does not work very well because there are not enough bristles on the bottom and the wire always bent the wrong way. This brush solves those issues quite well - there are plenty of bristles on the bottom, and the plastic handle flexes and allows extra pressure in the corners yet still returns to its original shape. The bristles are softer than those found on most bottle brushes, but still seem to do the job. I don't know how durable it will be, but my past experience with OXO products has been very good, so I expect this brush to last a long time.
B00004OCLJ This brush seems well designed.  The bristles seem durable, and they are soft enough to get in my thermos bottle.  I don't think they'd get in a soda bottle sized opening.  For the money, it's good.
B00004OCLJ I use this every day to clean my coffee tumbler and coffee pot and it still looks brand new.  The grip is high quality and I don't think the brush will ever wear out.  Great add-on item.
B00004OCLJ With the OXO bottle brush I can get to the bottom of glass bottles, aluminum drinking containers or most any other object requiring a flexible brush and long handle.  Good addition to practical household cleaning products.
B00004OCLJ It works great to wash the inside of my thermos bottle and other food jars with narrow openings.  I had it on my list to buy this kind of brush but never got around it until now; I'm glad I finally purchased it.
B00004OCLJ Works as I would expect a bottle brush to work. Perfect for my Thermos Nissan. Holds the soap well and rinses out easily.
B00004OCLJ It's okay....for washing bottles, mugs, jugs, etc. It will get the job done but I have another brush which I like better because of the cushioned handle and flexible neck.
B00004OCLJ Okay, MAYBE a bit more sanitary than a toilet bowl brush but it is one stiff bristled brush.  Crazy stiff.  If you want gentle, don't buy this.
B00004OCLJ This brush, is so much nicer then many we have owned before for cleaning our Coffee Thermos and Air Pot thermal containers.  Getting down to the area of a confined space, is never what anyone wants to tackle without the proper reach and design of a kitchen tool, made to do the work better, faster, and last longer.I and the Wife, can recommend this brush over many we have had or used before.  We now have one for both the camper and our home.
B00004OCLJ Mmmm. This brush gets quite a workout here. How do you talk about how wonderful a bottle cleaning brush is without it getting creepy/awkward? &#34;Oh, its amazing!!&#34; &#34;It sure gets the job done!&#34; &#34;Better than all the rest!&#34; &#34;So Sturdy!&#34; Etc. Moving on ...... I didn't really bottle feed my babies, but I did have a supply of bottles and got the cursory bottle brush to along with them. In the past 3 years or so, I was also given one and bought another, all rusted, never felt like they did a thorough job, and/or broke in half or the end bristles flattened. Then I saw this one on Amazon, and using other OXO products with success I bought my 4th bottle brush in 2.5 years. It's been over a year now and I'm still contented with the one I have with no thought to replace it. Bristles still clean effectively, wand/handle part is still maintaining the perfect balance of flexible but sturdy, and it doesn't look grungy. I do like the bristles better on this one than other brushes, soft, not wiry, but obviously sturdy. I was always left with the feeling that other standard bottle brushes would carry bacteria on the sponge ends, or scratch the inside of the bottles because they were too wiry. Now, I don't give bottles to my kids anymore, but I do bottle our own kombucha and want to make sure the bottles are quite clean, this brush serves that purpose. I find that I also use it to clean sport bottles, juicing equipment and cylindrical objects more often than not. I even took it over to my moms house to clean some coffee carafes (worked great) and accidentally left it there, and I really miss it this week of being without it!! Oh, I also use it to clean my Chemex. Works so great!!!I would like to say that a narrower one would be wonderful too, this fits in everything except my flip top bottles. So OXO if you see this, Pretty Please!!!
B00004OCLJ well made and fits about anywhere you can think of: glasses, bottles, coffee pot, nalgene bottles.  great oxo quality
B00004OCLJ We bought this to clean inside water bottles.  It works perfectly for that.  We don't use it for anything else, but it works great for cleaning out water bottles.
B00004OCLJ I bought this to clean the small necked bottles and glasses that I have. It works well for that purpose.
B00004OCLJ I really like this bottle brush!  The length is perfect and the handle is awesome (it won't slip out of your hand when wet).  The only reason for four stars is because the bristles are just too soft.  I like tougher bristles (almost impossible to find).  Other than that, it was a great purchase and I use it all of the time for glasses, stainless water bottles, glass water bottles, etc.  A must have in the kitchen.
B00004OCLJ I shopped around for a bottle brush locally and believe it or not could not find one anywhere! My water bottles were not getting clean enough so I wanted to give them a good scrub. This worked great.
B00004OCLJ Good brush for bottles, jugs and other odd shaped containers, works reasonably well, sturdy, comfortable to use.Only drawback, the end bristles could be of stiffer construction to get out stuck on food and dried out liquid residue.
B00004OCLJ Get this if you cycle. It's not enough tow ash out your bottle with water. This will clean them out real good. Very easy to use.
B00004OCLJ Bough some glass water bottles recently and this brush is the perfect tool for cleaning the insides, A little, hand detergent and warm water with this brush work miracles!
B00004OCLJ Gets the job done.  Stiff bristles but a little too short for cleaning large items such as the Thermos Nissan 61 Ounce SS Bottle.
B00004OCLJ My Casabella bottle brush broke.  The bristles started to falloff then the bristle head snapped off the handle as i was cleaning a bottle.  These were uber cheap $5 as an add-on and I like OXO stuff so I gave it a try.  The bristles are soft (which is what i wanted).  The length is perfect for my needs.Check the dimensions to see if it is long enough for you if you have tall bottles to clean.Shipped quickly and works as described and best of all was the price on amazon!
B00004OCLJ This brush works well to clean water bottles, just be careful when pulling it out through a smaller opening in the smaller bottles as it tends to flip water/soap everwhere. appears to be designed well and should last for some time.
B00004OCLJ BOTTLE TYPES WE OWNWe have numerous water bottles and stainless containers (Foogoo, Camelbak, Thermos to name a few).  Some are BPA free plastic, some stainless inside and out.BOTTLE NECK SIZEThe neck opening of each of our bottles varies from 1.5 inches up to 3 inches (this is a Foogoo lunch container).BRUSH BRISTLES AND PERFORMANCEThis brush is the best one we have tried (we have tried three other brands).  The bristles are firm enough to clean the bottles, but soft enough not to scratch them (unlike others we have tried).  The handle just below the brush is flexible so it bends making it very easy to get every nook and cranny in all our containers.We use it on a daily basis.  I donated our other ones after receiving this.
B00004OCLJ Works well for thermoses when you need to clean them.. I was very impressed with how clean it got them.
B00004OCLJ This brush is GREAT!  It's long enough for me to clean my 40 ounce LL Bean metal water bottle, and my Nalgenes, and my Polar insulated water bottles.  The brush really helps me get all of the gunk and deposits built up in my bottles.  The brush also seems high quality, and looks as if it will last me for a while.
B00004OCLJ My wife's Nalgene bottle has that narrow opening that's impossible to clean without this brush. The brush itself has some great firm bristles, and the stem has some slight flexibility, but will stay firm and doesn't seem it'll break unless you're deliberately trying.We also have the baby bottle brush from OXO that we plan on using for bottles, so if it's anything like this bottle brush, I know it'll work splendidly.
B00004OCLJ I was expecting something a little firmer to really scrub out the gunge in my water bottle. This only works if I use it while things are still 'fresh'.
B00004OCLJ this was just what i was looking for to clean all my reuseable water bottles... i use it for my sigg, klean kanteen, and nalgene.. it fits in all of them with ease!
B00004OCLJ Works great in all my water bottles. The brush fits perfectly in my camelback big chill and keeps it clean and germ free. The bristles are holding up nicely and it is plenty big enough to reach even the deepest water bottles. Highly recommend if you use water bottles.
B00004OCLJ This is probably the best Oxo product I've purchased! It is supremely flexible and adaptable, and I've used it to clean all sorts of things around the kitchen and in fact the whole house.AND, when you're done? It cleans itself in the dishwasher! How cool is that?!You'll love having this thing in the kitchen -- perfect for cleaning out water bottles, condiment bottles, whatever you have!Recommended without reservation! :)
B00004OCLJ I have been buying these kind of brushes for years.  This is the reason I don't mind washing my dishes by hand.  I used to hate using a dish cloth and getting hands wet. I change them about every 3 months.
B00004OCLJ this bottle brush fits in my takeya water bottle, and others, without any issues.  it seems to be well made and cleans bottles accordingly.  it does what it is supposed to!
B00004OCLJ I picked this up as an add-on item to substitute for the stainless version. It seems like pretty good quality for what it is. I have yet to test the dishwasher safeness of either but plan on it. I do wish that these had the replaceable brush head like some of their other products.
B00004OCLJ Put quite simply, OXO has done it again!  The quality of this Good Grips Bottle Brush exceeds all expectations in both design and execution.  The engineers at OXO are experts at what they do and their dedication to customer satisfaction is clearly seen in this superb brush.  Anyone who has purchased any OXO product will testify to the satisfaction one feels in using said product as well as the incredible value OXO always presents.  The OXO Good Grips Bottle Brush satisfies as no other brush possibly can because no other proudly displays OXO on the label.  OXO defines value, excellence, durability, and satisfaction and the Good Grips Bottle Brush is virtually OXO writ large.
B00004OCLJ This is good.  If only it had a suction cup at the bottom for it to stand on its own,  I would have given it 5 stars
B00004OCLJ I am so thrilled that I found this brush!  I was looking for a long time for a good brush to use with our nalgene bottles.  They are hard to clean with the small mouth but this brush allows to get all the way to the bottom of our large nalgene bottles and cleans them well.  If you have Nalgene bottles, you need this brush.
B00004OCLJ For years I had bottles and other narrow-mouth containers that needed cleaning. I would always find some way to cram a sponge or blast hot soapy water in there. I knew bottle brushes existed, but for some reason I just never got one. Somehow it came to mind to buy one on Amazon. This one is definitely a winner. It doesn't scratch like the cheap little ones my mom has. The long bristles and slightly flexible wand mean it can really clean just about anything very thoroughly. Just don't accidentally mix it up with a toilet bowl brush.
B00004OCLJ I don't know how I lived without this.  I was sick of my dishwasher eating my nalgene tops and having to wash the protein shaker bottles three times to get them clean.  Perfect size, easy to use, and effective.  Just add it to an order and you won't be disappointed.
B00004OCLJ It's really a no-brainer. I can't make my hand fit into a small opening, but this little wand does it's job, and does it well. Very happy with my purchase.
B00004OCLJ I just got this product yesterday.  I used it to clean out 4 of my water bottles and their lids.  Along with a long handle, the brush has bristles that stick up on the top and allow me to clean the bottome of the bottle very easily.  The brush also cleaned up under the rim of the bottles easily due to the direction of the bottom bristles.  It rinsed off easily and dried quickly.  So far, so good.  If it falls apart within 6 months I'll revise my review; otherwise I'd recomend it for cleaning water bottles/baby bottles/etc.
B00004OCLJ It brushes well, doesn't scratch, easy to clean and dries out easy too. Not much to add it does what it's suppose to do!
B00004OCLJ It is perfect for cleaning my water bottle that i use everyday for gym and work. Thanks to this brush i enjoy cleaning my bottle.
B00004OCLJ This is without a doubt the best performing bottle brush I have ever had the pleasure of using!  I have been deprived all these years!
B00004OCLJ Great product that is build very well and is sturdy.  I have another one that I bought years ago and this one is made so much better.
B00004OCLJ I purchased this to clean my thermos since I have started taking my lunch to school.  This is perfect for that and also my water bottle.  I just stick it in the dish washer to clean it.
B00004OCLJ If you have a bunch of water bottles and thinner travel coffee mugs- YOU NEED THIS BRUSH!Makes cleaning all those things so much easier. Can't believe I didn't buy one of these earlier!
B00004OCLJ Purchased this bottle brush because using a dish brush to clean Nalgene 32oz and 44oz is not a possibility.Glad I bought it; worth the price. The bristles are soft and pliable but still get their scrub on.
B00004OCLJ It suits the purpose of all my glass bottles, for juicing and glass drinking bottles!  The handle is bendy to allow you to work around the whole inside.  I just love it, as I was a little skeptical if it would fit some of my narrow drinking bottles, ended ups fretted more than I needed to.  Love it for the price point too!
B00004OCLJ I got this to properly clean mason jars, nalgenes, wide-mouth Siggs, especially near the curved parts.  Seems to rinse well and doesn't hold stains and dirt.  Dries pretty quick!
B00004OCLJ I have a SIGG water bottle that needed cleaning. My first search resulted in a special SIGG brush that was ~$9. This was ~$4. In combination with Efferdent tablets, this brush works great to clean and refresh the bottle and remove the metallic-y smell from my bottle. (DONT BUY THE SIGG TABLETS -- SIGG Tablets are 24 tablets for ~$8 while Efferdent, which works EXACTLY the same, is 120 tablets for ~$6!!!). Be smart people; Don't buy the SIGG branded stuff since this brush (and the Efferdent tablets) work just the same, if not better for a lot less money.
B00004OCLJ I like this brush, though I do wish it had a suction cup, or something, so it would be easier to be near the sink.  We lay it on the counter and let the brush part hang over into the sink.  It does a good job, though, even though the bristles are not as dense as other bottle brushes.  We had the other OXO brush with a stand, and while it was nice, the stand had a tendency to get moldy unless washed often.  For the price these are easy to replace when necessary.
B00004OCLJ This is a great product to clean children's sippy cups with. The bristles on the brush are soft enough where they won't scratch the cup, yet durable to do a thorough job cleaning the cup! I highly recommend for parents that are obsessed with clean cups!
B00004OCLJ I bought this brush so I could maybe use it in the bathroom to get scum out of the sink drain however it will not go in the drain.  It was much bigger than I thought but that is fine, I will use it for something else.  Still looking for a small headed brush to get down that drain!
B00004OCLJ OXO generally makes a good product. This is a nice brush. But for cleaning out my NISSAN 34oz themas it barely does the job. The handle should be about 3 to 4 inches longer and the bristles could be a little stiffer. A mix of stiff and softer bristles would be ideal. It works well for cleaning out my NISSAN Tea tumbler. Stiffer bristles would make getting the little ring of fine tea leaf residue that always seems to collect at the bottom and just wont rinse out at the end of the day when I finally get home. Its a good product just room for improvement.
B00004OCLJ I bought this brush because I use 3 KOR Aura bottles! I am VERY particular about how my bottles get cleaned, even going so far as washing them twice if I feel like anything is left over in them. This bottle brush works VERY well! It is not abrasive, but is firm enough to clean and is VERY good quality!I HIGHLY recommend!
B00004OCLJ I just bought this for 4 dollars and 99 cents at Target in Austin to use in my Soda Stream 1 Liter Bottles.SodaStream 1-Liter Carbonating Bottle, Gray, 2-PackI was concerned that it wasn't going to fit through the narrow opening in them, but that actually wasn't a problem at all.  It fit perfectly and worked great in them, so I tried it out in my Contigo coffee cup and in my large Thermos.  It did great in each application.  I am very happy with this brush.  It is well made, cleans thoroughly, and seems like it will last a very long time.  I have no complaints.
B00004OCLJ This brush is long enough to clean the bottom of my tall Thermos. It is very handy, and I am pleased with how well it works.
B00004OCLJ This bottle brush works really well to clean my stainless steel 27 oz water bottle. Here is why I like it:1. The diameter on the opening of my water bottle is 1 3/4 inches, and this easily fits inside.2. The handle and brush combined are a foot long, which makes it very easy to clean the bottom of the bottle.3. The leading negative review mentions another brush that has a slanted handle, which supposedly makes cleaning easier. But the handle on this brush is very flexible, and will bend and slant at whatever angle you want with just a little pressure.4. The bristles are effective at cleaning both the bottom and sides of the water bottle.5. The grip on the end of the handle is somewhat thicker, which makes it easy and comfortable to hold this brush while cleaning.Bottom line: This is sturdy and well made, and cleans effectively.
B00004OCLJ I got this bottle brush to clean out my drinking glasses after drinking my meal replacement drink, which leaves a lot of residue, and it works great. I like that it has bristles on the end, unlike brushes with a wire base, that have the bent over wire on the end. It seems this bottle brush is just what I wanted, and I would highly recommend it.
B00004OCLJ I'm a fan of OXO products and this one is no different. Well made and designed. The grip feels nice and has grooves, the shaft is slightly flexible and the brush is the correct size for what I needed. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that I think the bristles should be a bit stiffer, otherwise it's perfect.
B00004OCLJ My favorite brush.
B00004OCLJ I had purchased a urinal for my husband on Amazon, and he asked me what he could clean it with.  So I got him this OXO good grips bottle brush.  While the bristles could come down a little farther on the handle, even if you were to use it for a baby's bottle, the bristles are very wide, (and flexible while still being sturdy), making it an asset to cleaning any kind of bottle at all. Again, a wonderful OXO product! (Get the impression I am a fan?).  He says he loves it, so five stars it is!
B00004OCLJ I recently got a new job and have been driving an hour a day to get to it.  So I started taking coffee in this deep thermos mug which quickly became soiled.  This brush really does the trick and I have found it so useful for other cleaning operations.  Not good as a toothbrush, but good back scratch!  I took of one star because it doesn't really look so good, and the whole to hang it should be a smidge bigger so it goes over hooks more easilier.
B00004OCLJ I have found so many uses for this brush. Yesterday I was trying to clean the inside of a narrow mouth of a tall flower vase and was so happy to remember I had this item. Cleaned it up quick as a wink.
B00004OCLJ my dishwasher always leaves crud in the bottom in my juice glasses that i couldn't reach by hand. this is perfect. it's flexible too, so i can be rough and not worry about it breaking.
B00004OCLJ I love the Polar thermal water bottles.  But they have \"dimples\" in the sides of them that make them difficult to clean.  All my cycling bottles collect a lot of fine road dirt in them.  Until now, I've mostly lived with some residual dirt in the bottle.  I add soapy water, close and shake.  That gets most of the ick out, but not all.  But this brush is THE BEST brush for cleaning out my cycling bottles.  The handle is long enough to reach the bottom of all my drinking bottles and gallon glass juice jars.  The bristles are soft enough that the brush can be inserted into narrow neck bottles.  And they are stiff enough to do a good job of cleaning.  I don't believe in purchasing lots of specialized cleaning gadgets, but this on is a must.
B00004OCLJ This is a nice, high-quality bottle brush.It's very long, so I can clean my huge bottles as well as little ones.  It has a nice rubber handle on the end.The bristles aren't too stiff to get it through tight spots, nor too weak to scrub the bottle effectively.I'd buy it again.
B00004OCLJ Of course I didn't see all the reviews about the bristles being too soft to do a good job of cleaning the bottles until AFTER I ordered it, but I am so glad I ordered it before I saw that.  The brush came today and I used it in one of the 40 ounce kleen kanteen bottles that had mold?  something black inside the bottle and it worked great!  Clean as a whistle!  Love this brush!
B00004OCLJ This is a well-built, moderately long brush. I wish it were even just one inch longer, but it gets the job done: I have a very tall bottle that gets tortilla grit in the bottom (the first rule about People Chow is you do not talk about People Chow), and this helps clean it out.Simple requirement, and it is met. A+.
B00004OCLJ I've purchased other products from OXO before and like those products, it's a well made item and I see it lasting for some time.  I've always gotten my money's worth out of them and that's one of the most important things (next to quality) that I am looking for.
B00004OCLJ This brush seems to do the job pretty well. The handle is in a perfect length for what I need it for. There are some things that I recommend making modifications to the design.The brush is soft which made it easy to insert into a narrow opening of a bottle. I feel that it could be stiffer. The brush also had more spaces in between that I had expected.This brush is made for light cleaning
B00004OCLJ This is a great brush.  I use it for my 32oz Nalgene bottles and it works fine, but I also use it for my 16oz Takeya Glass Bottles and it especially works AWESOME for those because it touches all the sides of the bottle when it's in it!  When it's in the Nalgene bottle you have to circle it around to get all the sides, but not so with the smaller diamater bottles.  Handle is the perfect length and the bristles still stick out and look fine after 6 months of use.
B00004OCLJ It works well. It should last awhile and it doesn't have any fragile parts that would be prone to breaking.
B00004OCLJ Could not find a brush well suited for our Thermos containers until now. It is flexible and effective. It is also easy to clean. Is this 20 words yet?
B00004OCLJ Purchased to clean my stainless steel water bottles but this reaches into everything.  Cleans the kitchen glasses, coffee cups ... whatever.  It's a great little kitchen tool.
B00004OCLJ nice product, the collors are nice and i really enjoy. hight quality product. not so cheap but i love it.
B00004OCLJ This bottle brush is wonderful for cleaning all those hard to reach spots in water bottles or kettles. It has a lot of bristles but can still fit through most bottle necks. Highly recommend to anyone wanting to keep their water bottles sanitary.
B00004OCLJ I have several blender bottles and big 32 ounce tumblers that I drink from. Cleaning the bottom of these things was a pain until this brush. I use it all the time.
B00004OCLJ It's just a brush.  Nothing fancy.  Could have gotten a similar brush at the dollar store or Walmart for a lot less.
B00004OCLJ Does a great job of cleaning out my protein shaker bottles.  I used to just use a sponge, but I couldn't get in the little crevices (like the shaker spout) to get out the protein that had dried in there.  With this brush, I can easily get into little corners, while also scrubbing out my shaker quickly and efficiently.  The bristles are also soft enough that it won't scuff up the plastic shaker.  All in all, I would consider this a must for anyone who doesn't have access to a dish-washer, or who only has one shaker and doesn't want to run the dish-washer for one item.
B00004OCLJ What can I say. It's a brush and does what brushes do best. I rarely use it but it's nice to have around.
B00004OCLJ with water, soap and bits of food. We use it for glasses, the blender, other deep items - does an OK job, and it's the only tool we have right now to clean such things.But as soon as you pull the brush out of whatever you're washing, even a little bit, the bristles spray water, suds and food in all directions. It sprays my clothes, clean dishes in the dish drainer, the countertops, even the cabinet doors. That's at normal washing speed - I mean, you're trying to get the job done in a reasonable amount of time, right? So you're kind of moving right along, and spatterspatterspatter. It doesn't help to slow down - it still gets you. At the moment I have a few dozen spatter marks on my shirt, which means there are even more deposited in an arc around the sink.I've never had a bottle brush do this kind of thing, not so easily. OXO, this ain't rocket science! OXO's made me a pizza wheel that fell apart, another pizza wheel that collects water in the handle while in the dishwasher, so when you take it out you have to pull the handle off and put it and the blade to dry in the dish-drainer. OXO made me another scrub brush - the kind where you put soap in the handle and push on the rubber top to make the soap come out, but the entire brush tends to fall off quite easily. Again, not rocket science. I think maybe OXO \"engineers\" don't actually try to use the tools they design.
B00004OCLJ Perfect to scrub out my Nalgene on the fly water bottles.  Works really well, and does the job with a little bit of dishwashing soap.
B00004OCLJ I love that this has soft bristles that are tough enough to get stuck on foods off with ease. The handle is very sturdy unlike other bottle brushes and is the perfect length. The OXO Good Grio handle is perfect for anyone with grip issues like arthritis or carpel tunnel.
B00004OCLJ There are so many water bottles out there today that it's easy to end up with a collection of 10 or 20 before you realize you have nothing to use to clean the very bottom of the bottle.This brush does a great job reaching those tiny corners way down in the bottom of the bottle.  The bristles are flexible enough to be pushed into even small bottle necks so it will work for pretty much any water bottle out there today.  You can be brave enough to drink tea or juice out of your water bottles once you invest in this!
B00004OCLR I originally thought this one has round size for the brush, but it is slim. It turned out to be better on brush the tile lines and floor lines with cleaning soap.  Not bad.  The brush is pretty stiff and you put a great force on the brush area. kindly recommended, but think it is a little pricey...but I bet this brush will last many years.  LOL
B00004OCLR This is my second OXO grout brush and their must have been a change in the provider of the bristles because these are not the same as on my first brush.  I use this brush to clean the grout lines in my showers, specifically along the corners and rail for the shower door.  I use with a travertine cleaner, and while travertine requires a soft brush, this replacement brush seems to be much more delicate than the one I am used to.The handle is still well designed and I prefer the OXO design to other brushes on the market.  It is lightweight and has an ideal arc to the handle which allows you to scrub out the grout lines without rubbing out your knuckles.  Now it is a narrow brush and not ideal for scrubbing the entire wall, but as far as being able to get the grout area with minimal effort, this brush is a good choice.Maybe I just got a soft brush that was part of a bad batch and at this price point I cannot really complain.  So I would recommend and buy this brush again.
B00004OCLR This works great.  It does make you tired - I'm sure any 'elbow grease' scrubbing would, but it works.  It could use a little bit stronger bristles, but then maybe it would scratch.
B00004OCLR This little brush made quick work of cleaning soiled grout in the bathroom floor with a mild general cleanser.
B00004OCLR I use this to clean the grout in the shower.  Scrubs well, the handle is comfortable.  I spray the shower down with a bleach based cleaner like Tilex, let that sit for awhile while I clean the rest of the bathroom.  Then I come back with this brush and any discoloration comes out without much effort.  So far the brush has held up well for my purposes.
B00004OCLR This grout brush is ok for light duty, but it doesn't hold up for heavy scrubbing.  It wore out about halfway through cleaning my kitchen; for the price, I expected something better.  I purchased a different one at Whole Foods that has much stiffer bristles, and it works better and seems to be holding up better.
B00004OCLR I wish the handle was longer but it is good at getting into grooves.
B00004OCLR Use this brush in my shower and it works well.  I also use it around the base of my faucets.
B00004OCLR I really like OXO products so I expected that I would like this grout brush when I purchased it as an Add On item to fill out an order.  To my surprise, I not only like it, I love it.  I was one of those who was using an old toothbrush to do grout and I can't believe how much better the grout looks using this brush and with a lot less effort.I was so happy with the brush that I ordered another for the upstairs shower a week later.  This is a very well designed brush for grout and shower edges.
B00004OCLR Brush is of good construction and handy for those hard to reach places.  My only complaint is that the bristles are a little soft and get bent after a good thrashing, but held up pretty well after some abuse.  I have used it for tough jobs like cleaning around the base of the toilet, shower drains, etc. &#8203;
B00004OCLR I use it for cleaning out the coffee pot and otherglass bottles.  It works real good and the bristlesare tough and good for scrubbing.
B00004OCLR Very disappointed in this product.  The bristles are too soft to really clean grout and the shape of the head isn't optimal for that purpose either.
B00004OCLR This grout brush sure beats using a toothbrush!!  It has firm bristles, a comfortable handle and it sure cuts down on the back breaking labor of cleaning grout.  Wish is had a handle that you could screw an extension into so that you wouldn't have to get on your hands and knees to clean the grout on tile floors.  I guess that's just my \"old age\" and \"bad back\" talking....but it would sure help!  Maybe Oxo is listening...lol.
B00004OCLR I used this brush to get out tough stains from years of use on granite flooring.  The grout became as good as new.  I recommend this.
B00004OCLR Handy design and a good sturdy brush that works well for corners and grout lines in the shower or around sinks.
B00004OCLR This brush is a partner in house cleaning. The angle of this brush allows me to get into thosehard to reach area, i.e. shower stall corners, shower doors, corner grout areas.
B00004OCLR If you are getting the grout cleaner, get this brush.  It is easy to use and easy on the wrist.
B00004OCLR A great multi-purpose brush!~....OXO Good Grips Grout Brush....all these items have been great this brand as far as price and quality this is great for some serious scrubbing I like the long handle!~
B00004OCLR Purchased for my housekeeper to use on cleaning up grout lines that had aged. She used it with a grout solution, brush has held up well and she is pleased with product. In fact she liked the OXO brushes so much - she asked me to purchase additional styles for tight spaces.
B00004OCLR THIS BRUSH IS SO GOOD. IT CLEANS WERE OTHER BRUSH;S CAN;T GET TO. YOU CAN USED THIS ANY WERE.IN YOUR HOME. GREAT BUY.
B00004OCLR I'm a big fan of the Oxo Good Grips products generally and this brush does not disappoint. The list price on Amazon is about the same as you will see at most offline retailers but Amazon's actual sale price makes it more comparable with similar generic brushes in the offline places.The brush is very sturdy, easy to manipulate and clean, and stands up to some tough cleaning situations. The bristles don't deform under heavy use, which is usually what happens with other brushes I've tested. We've found this to be a very solid product and will definitely buy the same replacement whenever this starts to fail.
B00004OCLR I am a bit disappointed with this brush. It gets the job done but the bristles seem to splay out easily when using any sort of force. I was able to use this regularly for about three months before deciding the brush was well and truly dead and I needed to find another one. I am now looking around for a new one but if I don't find one to my liking I will probably get another one of these because although it is very short-lived, the grip is comfortable and it does work fairly well while it's still good.
B00004OCLR I've used a similar hand scrub brush and loved it.  This grout brush has a longer handle though it's scrubbing surface is not as long.  It is excellent for use in corners or when you don't feel like kneeling.
B00004OCLR I have white tile in all the bathrooms, and the grout gets stained. Nothing for it but to scrub the grout occasionally. Not my favorite job, but this brush is comfy and the handle is at the right angle.Here is the recipe I use to make grout cleaner. I think it works better than commercial sprays and it's cost-effective:1/2 cup of baking soda1/3 cup of ammonia1/4 cup of white vinegar7 cups of waterPour this into a spray bottle (not one use previously for bleach; I would suggest buying a clean, new bottle at the hardware store.) Spray on, scrub. Do not ever mix with bleach; ammonia and bleach release chlorine gas from the bleach and it is instantly toxic to the lungs and can overpower you quickly.
B00004OCLR I am old enough to remember &#34;The Fuller Brush Man&#34;.  After the Korean War, many veterans sold door-to-door for the Fuller Company while they were trying to get back into civilian life.  The &#34;Fuller Brush Man&#34; came through our neighborhood several times a year.  Since I was the one who usually opened the door, I got a good dose of his wholesome first impression.  He carried a large well worn leather case.  When he opened it onto our living room floor, a fantastic array of brushes would spill out.  My mother always bought something.I guess OXO somehow fills the gap left by the missing &#34;Fuller Brush Man&#34;
B00004OCLR I have stuff I needed to scrub really hard to get clean.  The bristles on this brush bend and fold over.  They are long and just don't feel like I can get any muscle behind my scrubs.
B00004OCLR OXO makes great household products and what I love about this brush is that you can reach the corners of the shower tiles. It's comfortable to hold and it scrubs really well. Highly recommended.
B00004OCLR I'm impressed with this brush. I had some dirty grout in my kitchen and this brush knocked it out with ease and it didn't even bend the bristles. I would buy it again.
B00004OCLR This brush is considerably larger than a toothbrush and grips well in the hand. They call it a \"a grout brush\"; not for brushing freshly poured grout (cement), but for brushing in grout joints between tiles.I tried the brush in the shower using CLR liquid cleaner and the brush does a fine job of getting the CLR cleaner deep into the joints and the calcium, lime and mold deposits out. Also brushed the shower head several times and let the solution stand. Very satisfied about the results. Because of its narrow brushing head, the brush does well in the commode under the outer lip where fresh water enters and also down deep in the narrows of the commode.I also use this brush to brush the hardware fittings on my boat that have rusted. It works well.The brush is unlike any brush I have ever seen in the brick and mortar stores.When this one wears out, I will reorder another.
B00004OCLR Pretty much every Good Grips product that I've bought over the years has been great, and this brush is no exception.  The bristles are nice and strong, so that even with some serious pushing into the grout of our shower, they don't bend and stay in place.  The hole on this is also a nice feature since it allows me to hang it in the shower for ease of use.  Useful product!
B00004OCLR This is especially helpful for those of us with arthritic hands. Scrubbing the grout lines was so much easier than im old way~with an old toothbrush. Wonderful too with good design!
B00004OCLR Love this brush. It is sturdy and really does its job well. I am thinking of ordering another one to have as a replacement just in case I wear it out
B00004OCLR about this brush, I would say it's slightly overpriced. It's hard bristle brush with the handle. I just tried it, it's OK like any other brush.
B00004OCLR Great for scrubbing everything!  I have one in each bathroom and in the kitchen.  Am going to add another to the basket for cleaning various bird baths in the yard.
B00004OCLR I just finished cleaning my kitchen and dining room tile. This brush is super and I am glad that I made the purchase.
B00004OCLR we purchased a floor steam cleaner which does a great job on the tiles, but can't get the grout. This brush does clean the grout very well, in a short time.It is constructed well, and designed well, so the hand doesn't get tired.
B00004OCLR Elbow grease required. Cleaning solution required. Dirty grout or shower floor required. Now, get cleaning....it won't get clean by itself.
B00004OCLR This is a great brush for smaller tile areas, such as shower or tub walls. Probably not what you would use on a large ceramic tile floor, unless you are only going to spot clean an aria. Unless of course you don't mind being on your hands and knees cleaning a large area.Living in Florida I have over 2000 SF of ceramic tile area to clean, and I don't think I would care to do it on my knees. I am looking for a sturdy grout brush such as this but with a long handle. So far I have not been able to find one that suits me.This brush has a row of very stiff bristles in the center, and another row going around them that are not quite as stiff. The handle is quite comfortable to hold and work with plus feels sturdy enough to apply pressure.  It did an excellent job on my shower wall grout, and some spot cleaning on my floor. This brush is also great for cleaning along wall edges and corners.Oxo Good Grips makes some great products at reasonable prices, I know since I have some other items from them. I would definitely recommend this brush.
B00004OCLR This brush will make a good bathroom brush since it is narrow.  It will clean behind the faucet and other tight area's.  I also bought the other set of two (2)  OXO brushes (a few months ago) so now I'm set for cleaning.  I can throw away all the old tooth brushes.  I have never found anything wrong with any of the OXO products I have purchased.  Another great brush from OXO!!
B00004OCLR Really helps get the grout clean and also really helps in tight corners. I do have to scrub a little, but this really takes a lot of the work out of it which helps me clean less and play with my baby more!
B00004OCLR The bristles on this brush are stiff enough to do a good job, and just soft enough to be a bit pliable. When cleaning floor tile, it is really handy with the longer handle that is soft enough that it does not hurt your hands.
B00004OCLR The stiff bristles on this OXO grout brush tackle even the toughest soap scum and mildew stains on grout with ease - even older white grout comes out looking nice!  The soft handle makes the chore of cleaning a bit less stressful on your hands, and the length is just perfect for the task of grout cleaning.  I find that spraying some shower cleaner, letting it soak for a few minutes, then tackling it with this grout brush makes my showers/tubs come out looking like new again.  The bristles on this brush have held up the test of time, and have yet to show signs of wear from multiple use.I wouldn't go back to any other type of brush again!
B00004OCLR She wanted a brush to clean off the bottoms of her shoes, so I bought her one of these. When I saw it, I decided I wanted one of these for myself too. This Oxo brush has a very comfortable handle and is angled just right. I like using it to clean those seams where sink meets wall and bathtub meets wall. Even the bristles are just the right mix of flexibility and stiffness so one doesn't have to worry about scratching surfaces.For the current price (five dollars) this great brush is a bargain.
B00004OCLR I love most of OXO's products and this brush is no different.  Its size is optimized for working on the tough grout lines.  I recommend this brush.
B00004OCLR This is a great grout brush, with a nicely designed handle that's perfect for giving the grout an good ole marine scrub. Unlike the other reviewer, I think this makes a lousy dish brush. The brush is designed stiff and narrow. For a dish brush, I would prefer something with more surface area, like the ones OXO makes.
B00004OCLR I love this brush for grout and other narrow places. Worked nicely on the tops of baseboards.
B00004OCLR This works well as a vegetable brush.  Some of the bristles are already coming out with minimal use, thus the reason for only four stars.
B00004OCLR The OXO Good Grips 3781 Grout Brush does a good job cleaning very dirty grout.  I'm using it withHoover AH30285 Floor Mate 32-Ounce Tile and Grout SprayandHoover FloorMate SpinScrub Wet/Dry Vacuum Cleaner, H3044.My process is to spray a heavy coat of the grout cleaner, wait 4-6 minutes, scrub with the Good Grips Grout Brush, wipe up the excess cleaner and loosened dirt with a sponge, and then scrub with the FloorMate.I like the Grout Brush, but there are two improvements I would make.  First, I would have a longer handle.  With the short handle, it's definitely a hands-and-knees operation, and that wears thin when you have many square feet to clean.  Second, I would make the bristles stiffer.  I've used the brush to clean about 450 sguare feet of tile, and the bristles are already beginning to seem a bit mashed.  That might be because I was cleaning very dirty grout, but it does make me think that the life of the brush may not be that long.
B00004OCLR This brush was purchased to a shower in an apartment we lived in. It was terrible to keep clean. I little bit of a bleach based cleaner and this brush did the job well. The handle is also very comfortable.
B00004OCLR This brush is a giant packed into a little package. The extra stout bristles and strong handle, make it a perfect accessory to any cleaning kit. Household, or Garage.
B00004OCLS A great scrub brush for floors and carpets!  Sturdy, easy to use and very cost-effective.  I was very happy with the quality of this brush and it does a great job on my kitchen floor!
B00004OCLS good scrub brush that is easy on the hands
B00004OCLS This brush is durable and will withstand the toughest of chemicals.I like the hand-friendly grip and thorough cleaning that can be accomplished by this brush.
B00004OCLS I love this product and would recommend this to everyone.  The price is so much less and comes in fast.  Our family loves this product and use it often!
B00004OCLS Got this for scrubbing some mildew/mold out of my shower tub. It works like a charm! It fits nicely in my hand and seems to be of good quality (bristles not too hard or too soft). As always, impressed with OXO products.
B00004OCLS This brush is easy to hold, very comfortable in the hand, and has very strong bristles to clean the shower bottom and tile.  I like the size of the brush because it requires less effort than the smaller ones.
B00004OCLS I was surprised, and delighted, the brush is much bigger than I had expected. It works great!! great deal, would def recommend, I use it to clean carpet stains and it doesn't hurt my hands and does a great job.
B00004OCLS This is a really heavy-duty brush.  It is perfect for scrubbing spills out of the carpet and soap scum in the shower.  I like the soft-grip handle, also.
B00004OCLS As OXO delivers with quality.  I have crippled fingers that are so painful (arthritis).  I bought this to clean our shower with and it is perfect fit to my hand/allows me to use the strength of my hand Vs. using my painful fingers...and it cleans great.
B00004OCLS I always used a dishrag or a sponge for cleaning counter tops.  Then I read a review of this product that mentioned using the brush for counter tops and stainless steel sinks.  I am so glad that this review prompted me to buy this brush.  It really cleans up the counter tops and the stainless sink looks really great after cleaning with this brush.  It is also a great tool for cleaning the interior of the refrigerator.  It has cut down the time required to do that job, and just makes this weekly task more effective in less time.  It's an excellent investment and would have been worth the cost at twice the price.
B00004OCLS I just cleaned my screens, and door sills and jams. This is a great addition to my cleaning tools. Love it.
B00004OCLS This is a really nice brush with a great design, like most all OXO products. I do think it is a little pricey for a scrub brush, but Lowe's is selling a generic version that's not as good for only one buck less ... so, all in all, pretty good.
B00004OCLS Get's the job done perfectly, hard bristles breaks up the soup scum, and grim easily very easy to grip and handle.
B00004OCLT well designed scrub brush;easy on the hands
B00004OCLT I like my potatoes with the skins on. So, I always vigorously scrub wash the skins. I used to use the Scotch brand green/yellow scrubby sponges, but this works much better to actually clean down into all the little crevices. The size works perfect for me and the handle is easy to grip when wet.
B00004OCLT This brush has a wide rubber grip handle and firm bristles.  What makes it a bit unique is its size - at 11.1\" it is nearly a foot long.  You can use it to clean a large area where a smaller brush would make the job tedious, and in some instances to avoid bending as much due to its reach.The bristles are synthetic and fairly heavy gauge.  They can be used to clean corrosive acids and alkalis although this was made for use in bathrooms and kitchens.  I tested it on the shower floor and it's perfect for that type of work.The instructions say this brush can be cleaned in the dishwasher.  With most brushes, the high heat of a dishwasher would cause bristles to fall out.
B00004OCLT How did I ever do with out this GREAT brush, I didn't do well. I have a sink which is attached to the wall with 2 long posts holding it up in front of the sink. It is completely open underneath. It was very difficult to clean the tile on the wall behind the sink and even worse to clean the corner against the wall on the floor. That corner would really get dirty and the only way to clean it was to get on my knees snd reach.. My husband would have come to the rescue. Now all I have to do is bend because of the long handle..This brush cleaned the whole corner. Got into very crevice. Wiped the corner completely clean. It is fantastic to clean the indentation between the tiles on the wall and the tiles on the floor all around the bathroom floor. This cleans grout beautifully even though it is a very wide brush. It cleaned out all the dark grout between my old wall tiles where the grout was embedded in very narrow spaces..I did spray the tiles with Clorox Liquid Bathroom Disenfectant first.  The picture makes the brush look slim but that is misleading. The measurements are 11.1 long. The brush is 3.6 x 3.2 inches wide. Trust me, you will find many more uses than corners with this wonderful multi purpose cleaning tool.
B00004OCLT I actually bought this in a store but then couldn't find the same one til I found it on Amazon.  It was one of the best dish cleaning brushes I've used--also works well on pots and pans.  I liked it so much that I ordered a second one to have on hand just in case they quit selling this one.
B00004OCLT the brush head 
B00004OCLT I use this brush in the kitchen and love it. It is great for scrubbing dishes, pots and pans and also to scrub the sink out once the dishes are done. Another great OXO product
B00004OCLT I like this brush because the bristles are thick and have a convex shape to the brush to get in and dig out the grime.  The handle is solid, too.
B00004OCLT After getting this brush I thought 
B00004OCLT I usually buy Oxo - see my other reviews. This is a very good brush initially. We tried it on the bathroom shower stall corners - works okay... Hope this helps.
B00004OCLT Does what it says--gets in those hard to reach places like the corners of the tub, grout, etc. The handle is perfect. OXO always makes quality stuff and this is no exception. I actually got rid of the mildew in the corner (well, the bleach did) because I could actually get in there for once.
B00004OCLT I couldnt find a brush big enough for our tiled shower that would get the corners and this works great. Cant say enough about it
B00004OCLT I've dedicated this brush to shower maintenance, and another in the kitchen would probably be an equally good investment. Oxo brushes stand up really well and have just the right amount of stiffness to speed the work along.This brush cleans the shower stall with much less effort than previous methods, thanks to the large brush head and perfect grip and angle on the handle. It does the flat surfaces quickly and easily gets into the corners and crevices.Here's a great tip I've learned after much experimentation. Clean your shower with a spray bottle filled with one cup of white vinegar and three cups of water - add a few drops of dish soap if you like. The vinegar retards mold and mildew very effectively, and it's much easier on my nose than the chlorine bleach products I had been using.The same vinegar solution is great for water bottles, watch bands, and anything else that has a tendency to start smelling like an old dish rag. It's cheap, it's safe, and it's effective. Wish I'd known about this a long time ago.
B00004OCLT Sturdy, easy to use handle, bristles have not broken off.  Great for edge cleaning but not over wide surface areas like walls.  Yup, it is truly a good corner and edges brush.
B00004OCLT This is an excellent shower brush.  I hang mine from my shower caddy where it's ready for use.Gets into corners and the bristles are stiff enough to do a really good job.
B00004OCLT My male significant other cannot hit the oval bowl.  The tile floor must be scrubbed weekly.  This does the job without too much pressure on the joints!.
B00004OCLT I highly recommend this brush. Like all of Oxo products, it is well designed, easy to handle and does a superior job of household cleanup.
B00004OCLT I just finished brushing my screens and cleaning my screens and doorways and am happy that I purchased this brush.
B00004OCLT I use this brush to clean my tile grout. It gets into small spaces very well and the brush head is strong enough to clean the grooves in my shower grout line which is very narrow.
B00004S1DJ I bought this to hold small cosmetics in my bathroom and I have it suctioned to a tile wall.  It is a perfect size for eyeliner, mascara, concealer, and other small cosmetics that I want to keep in easy reach.  The hold has been great so far - it has been about two months and it has not slipped or fallen.
B00004S1DJ I tried to attach this to my granite backsplash.  The suction cups hold, but the whole thing slowly slips down until it's resting on the counter.I solved that problem by putting a couple wine corks underneath the whole thing.
B00004S1DJ This was my favorite sponge holder for the last couple of years on my old stainless steel sink. My new sink is also stainless but has a slightly more brushed finish and unfortunately this will not stick for longer than 30 seconds. No matter what I do. Based on the other reviews, it must not just be my sink. Oh well. Time to move on.
B00004S1DJ Suction cups work well...holds a few light to medium weight items and is very easy to clean...transparent view is very helpful for seeing any dirty build-up against the sink...
B00004S1DJ I've had three of these for over 10 years (clear and white). They are handy in the medicine cabinet, kitchen, and shower. My only gripe is that the back is not flat (bows in). I've replaced the suction cups a few times because they get flat/dried out and won't stick.Please make one that is deeper for pot brushes, utensils, or tubes of hair products!
B00004S1DJ Does exactly what it's supposed to. I don't have to worry about it rusting. It's easy to clean. It does come un-stuck once in awhile but no biggie.
B00004S1DJ It works really well, I got the suction cups a little wet, stuck it to the side of my shower and it stayed.  :) I keep some facewashes in it, they're not super heavy, but I'm surprised at how much weight it can hold without falling down. Soap scum stuff gets on it after a while, but it washes off easily. I'm happy with it! For the price I can't find anything better.
B00004S1DJ I use it in the bathroom, to hold the sponge I use to clean the tub. It adheres to the bath tub walls very well. My tub walls are a weird cheap kind of plastic, so I was not sure at all if it would stick to it. I just wetted the suction with a few drops of water, and it sticks without problems.
B00004S1DJ I bought this because of it's relatively low price. I've had similar products in the past and if you wet the suction cups they stuck to pretty much anything clean, flat and dry. I tried this on a variety of different surfaces around my sink such as metal, porcelain and counter top. I could not get this to stick to anything no matter what I did. I tried the suction cups both dry and moistened and it just doesn't stick. Not worth the money.
B00004S1DJ This Sponge/Scrub Caddy works very well in my sink. It looks good and serves it purpose.I'm sure I will be looking to buy more for my friends and family for gifts.
B00004S1DJ The suction strength is excellent, no issues with suction power, it is make sure I can find the sponge every time.  My wife and I really like this, this solves the forever question of where is the sponge.
B00004S1DJ I don't have a deep sink so I didn't want one that was too big.this is perfect for holding my scrubber brush with handle, metal scrubber, and sponge.The suction on it is great too on my stainless steel sink.I pull it upward off of the top edge when I want to take if off to clean.Once on though, I have to either do that or  pull really hard to get it to come off which is exactly right.
B00004S1DJ I find this a must have.  You can put your sponge in it and anything else you'd want.  This way you're not leaving sponges in the sink to get dirty.
B00004S1DJ I like that it's clear.  It has perforation underneath for better drainage and fast drying.  It provide just enough space without taking up to much space.  I recommend it!
B00004S1DJ after struggling with the metal holders for so many years, rusting away after few months each time, I finally found a product that holds up, dish washer safe and easy to maintain!! highly recommended. suction works great as well.
B00004S1DJ I just stuck mine on the inside of my claw tub and put some soap and razors in it, it's perfect.
B00004S1DJ I bought this sponge/scrub caddy to keep my kitchen clean and organize and it did the job beyond what i asked.
B00004S1DJ This was a replacement for one that looked just like it, but was larger... I didn't realize this until I received the item... but I'm using it anyway, just not putting as many things in it.. seems to be fine other than this.
B00004SRAX The box contains a large warning: This product contains/may contain a chemical known to cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harm. Now, why would I want to wash my clothes with a product that contains such a chemical? Of course it's being returned.Secondarily, the box states \"Made in USA\", while the plastic wrapper inside says \"Made in China\". They don't even know where it's made.
B00004SRAX I've used this kit several times while traveling abroad.  The plug is handy, especially in older hotels that have sinks without a sufficient stopper.  My big problem is with the woolite packets.  Nearly every time I travel with these, at least one breaks open and spills all over my stuff.  Not a huge tragedy since it's soap, but a mess and a pain in the neck just the same.  I started packing them in ziplock baggies, so that WHEN not IF one of them bursts, the mess is contained.  The woolite does clean very nicely, though, and I can clean a few days of underthings and socks with one packet.
B00004SRAX I like the size of the pouches.  I have not tried the stopper yet.  I think smaller pouches and more of them would be better since I travel alone.  For a family this size is better.
B00004SRAX fortunately we didnt stay anywhere that did not have a sink stop, so i didnt use the stopper that came with this. I did use the packets of detergent and they were great. mild scent and worked in the sink well, i used cold water to wash and it was fine. i didnt even need an entire packet for a handful of items, would be great if these were resealable, to save unused amounts mess free.
B00004SRAX No one wants to spend vacation time washing clothes in a Laundromat, especially if you are overseas.  Having the laundry done by hotel staff is very expensive but I didn't want to tote dirty clothes around for 17 days!!!  And the fees airlines charge for extra or oversized luggage are ridiculous if you try to take the amount of clothing you need for a long trip.This was recommended by a friend and is the perfect compromise!!!  I love Woolite anyway and the sink stopper is a great addition.  I purchased a travel clothesline and pins and now can wash items as I wish anywhere!!  I will continue buying additional as we travel frequently.
B00004SRAX I have used this kit three summers in a row to wash my delicates while traveling abroad. The sink stopper is a wonderful invention and tends to work on most tumba and deep sinks. On very small sinks, it will still work but you may notice it does not hold as tight of a seal. The soap packets are a good size, though I typically only use about half of the packet for six or so undergarments. As long as I fold down the top of the packet, the rest of the Woolite stays inside. The Woolite is easy to wash out and leaves my clothes clean and soft. I would highly recommend this kit to anyone going on a trip who may need to do an emergency load of laundry!
B00004SRAX I would buy the packs of Woolite again.  Went to China and did not need the stopper and the hotels had cords in the showers.  Wish I had taken my rod hooks that have clothes pin type bottoms for hanging things on the shower head or on the shower cords.
B00004SRAX I took this and used the wool lite twice on a 16day trip. Never needed the stopper. Suggest that a come with a reusable container, since the box was crushed flat. Maybe a plastic case the size of a travel first aid kit. And adding some nylon line for a clothes line would make it a complete package.
B00004SRAX Great to travel with in case you don't have access to a laundromat. A sink is all you need, and each packet is very nice size for socks, underwear, T-shirts and such. I kept them in the mesh pocket of my suitcase along with other stuff, but they are sturdy enough and didn't puncture. Smells great and rinses off very easily.
B00004SRAX This stopper worked in five different hotel rooms on our last trip. Even when we stay in first class hotels as we did in Istanbul, I will not pay $12 to get pajamas laundered. I think that's criminal. Okay, so maybe you don't need the packets of Woolite, but it's a nice touch. Worth the money.
B00004SRAX The Woolite packets were perfect size for a small European washer in the apartments we stayed in during a 3 wk trip to Rome, Venice and Bavaria.  The sink plug was great as well but I used it to do dishes:)
B00004SRAX Woolite is the best for hand washing in the sink. I travel with only fast dry underwear that I wash, dries overnight. Woolite is low suds, rinses out completely. Travel pack a great convenience rather than pack a heavy bottle that will not fit a 1 quart TSA bag!
B00004SRAX These fit in any travel kit and the stopper is wide enough for just about any size drain. Honestly, if your sink drain is too big for this stopper, you're going to lose socks and underwear!  I'm looking forward to using this!
B00004SRAX I honestly just bought this pack for the drain stop. I didn't use the laundry detergent.The drain stop is great. Frankly, I don't quite understand how it works, but it does. Used in probably 10 different hostel sinks and not a single one leaked
B00004T7UJ The glass is top notch...I have used some that were thinner and therefore less bulky in the pocket, nevertheless, we give these two purchased a 5 star as they are better than any I could find nowadays....yep, buy again after I loose these...
B00004T7UJ i love ittes tools General Tools 532 2.5 Power Pocket Magnifier nice to see any thing small to be big in your eye
B00004T7UJ I am very pleased with this pocket magnifier. It is strong enough to read what I am looking at.It should last for some trime.
B00004T7UJ Light, compact, easy to have with me at anytime. Just what I wanted & cheap enough to not worry about. True glass and unlike other reviews, looked good all the way from center to the edge. I bought two & both were identical. For the price they can't be beat, but some people expect magic & can't be pleased at all. This was a good purchase just for a little visual aid-not a a scientific instrument.
B00004T7UJ I bought this as well as the Carson Pendant magnifier. The lenses are both the same size.For starters, the GT 532 took 12 days to receive it! The Carson arrived in two days. Both ordered the same time...I recently had cataract surgery and opted to have my nearsightedness corrected, which left me unable to see anything closer than about 4'. I bought an assortment of reading glasses from Walmart, as well as these two magnifiers, just to get by for the moment.If I had to pick one or the other, the Carson is the winner. It is less bulky, and IMO, allows me to see better, with or without glasses.It has a better case as well. I will keep this for those moments when I forget what I did with the Carson Pendant magnifier.I also bought a lighted, free standing/handheld, 5x Carson FH-25 magnifier at Walmart for $13. I have not found any better product than what Carson has to offer.
B00004YK0Y The battery was exactly what I needed, it was not outdated and arrived quickly.  I sometimes find it difficult to locate the right button battery when one is needed; seems there is no rhyme or reason given to battery names.  When I open a product to see what is needed, I look up the battery number online and frequently get hits on batteries that do not even come close to resembling the one I have.  I am not sure why button batteries have so many different equivalent names, but I have included some below for this battery in the hopes it will help someone else.A76 equivalent batteries:  1128MP, 1166A, AG13, D76A, G13A, GPA7, GPA76, LR44, LR1154, L1154, PX675A, PX76A, RPX675, S76, V13GA, 357A, RW82, KA, A76, 208-904, SB-F9, G13-A, CA18, CA19, LR44, A-76, 76A
B00004YK0Y It's a battery.  How much can you really review it but to say, don't buy generics of these little batteries.  They also don't like the cold.  Seems to zap the life right out of them.
B00004YK0Y obviously  a major bran with lasting energy. Pink bunny is right ;-)  it keeps my electronics going for a ridiculous amount of time
B00004YK0Y I received this battery in the proper packaging just as the picture depicts but the battery was just as dead as the one I was trying to replace. Yes, I can return it for refund but after Ive paid the shipping to send it back I'm hardly better off. I should have just gone to radio shack in the first place.Ive bought bateries three times on amazon (two different sellers) and they have always been useless.Lesson learned.
B00004YK0Y Not sure how to rate a battery. By life expectancy? I bought this for a toy and it is still going strong.
B00004YK0Y I needed this size battery and I was having trouble finding it in any stores around me.  Amazon has everything!  The batteries are for a little light that I attach to my keys and I can click it on when it is dark and find the key hole without any trouble at all.
B00004YK10 Holds a charge very well. Energizer is the best.  They again want to many words for a minimum. Get this brand.
B00004YK10 Strange - the pack was definitely unopened, but one of the cells was pretty dead.Too much hassle to return, so I'll just accept that I got one expensive battery.
B00004YK10 Bought these to replace a failed battery in a remote control for an overhead light/fan.  They worked, and have continued to work for quite a while now.  That's about all I've got.
B00004YK10 This was a hard battery to find for my door bell.  The price was great could not be better as well as it coming in three days.
B00004YK10 Good batteries for a nice low price, got these for my car remote and they work fine. Not much else to say.
B00004YK10 Great value. I have a tough time finding odd size batteries,not anymore. Thanks for the quick delivery and great price on the batteries
B00004YK10 We needed these batteries for our garage door opener.  They are a weird size and were much more expensive at brick and mortar stores so we bought them at amazon... as usual, they were the best price!
B00004YK10 They are batteries and they work - enough said! They arrived in the original package as pictured on the product description page. I couldn't find these in stores anywhere so was glad they were on Amazon.
B00004YK10 There is very little to say about simple batteries like this.  They work as expected.  No surprises in any way.
B00004YK10 As a battery, it works great, and it was very cheap. I would definitely use and buy again. very worth the money.
B00004YK10 I had used Duracell previously in Mail Chime (ASIN B00103FDDU) and been very satisfied with the life and the simple and plain date code / expiration date on the Duracell.  I have to change out the Duracell twice a year, so I thought I'd see if the Energizer had a longer life.  These Energizer only lasted a few days before failure.  They were new and sealed in package with Use by date of September 2015.  Based on Duracells having expiration dates about 3-4 years out, I thought this was odd and contacted Energizer.  Energizer indicated the A23 batteries have a 3 year shelf life and that my package was made in December 2012, would expire in December 2015 and should be used by September 2015.  I wish they would print something like that or more consumer friendly on the package.  So my batteries were reasonably fresh and I don't know why they failed so quickly.  Switched back to the Duracell version and they work fine, so I'm sticking with them for my application.  Both the Energizer and Duracell batteries came from the same Amazon merchant.
B00004YK10 Needed these for garage door opener remote. Went to local store and they were priced at almost three times the cost of these. They were identical, fresh and were shipped quickly.
B00004YK10 Exactly what I ordered, free shipping and well packaged.  Time frame was no more than 3 days.  Used it for my wireless doorbell, too bad that I got nice batteries for a cheap doorbell that it broke in less than a week.  Sorry for my comment but batteries were fine.
B00004YK10 There's not much to review here. Batteries came packaged and shipped well. They work in my garage door remote. No complaints here.
B00004YK10 Brand name as described.  Nice fresh batteries, so expecting to have excellent operational life and good shelf life for extras. Great pricing to boot, so value is exceptional.
B00004YK10 These are a great price.  My garage door opener uses these for the remote and at Radio Shack they are almost $8 a piece because they are 12 volts.
B00004YK10 These Energizer A23 12 Volt batteries have met all my A23 battery needs.  When my wife says &#34;Honey, do you have an A23 battery for this obscure device that uses an absurd battery size?&#34;  I can happily say &#34;But of course, I always keep a few A23's on hand, my dear.&#34;I use a lot of quirky gadgets.  This fit into the remote for an outlet control switch, as well as several other things I've encountered.  Overall, recommend.
B00004YK10 This vendor provided fresh batteries and their price was the lowest, when shipping cost is considered.  This particular battery is hard to find where I live but is in two devices I own, so I was glad they were listed on Amazon, where you can shop intelligently.
B00004YK10 These batteries fit some small remote controls and other electronic gadgets.  They can be hard to find in retail stores, and can be expensive as well.  These are name brand batteries, work fine, and are low cost.Dean Park
B00004YK10 Saved a lot of money by not wasting fuel from driving store to store looking for a place that carries these batteries.
B00004YK10 A23 batteries are common for remote doorbells and other small devices that require a high voltage.  Energizer is a trusted name and their products are time tested.
B00004YK10 Hooray for the Energizer Bunny!  He came through again for me, making my Christmas tree lights remote work again.  I'd about given up.
B00004YK10 My garage remote opener battery died about a week ago, so I decided to go to the local megastore to get a new one. I didn't bother checking the details of my battery's characteristics, assuming that a \"short skinny battery\" would be all I needed to remember. I found a couple of batteries that more or less looked like my garage door's battery so I bought them, only to discover that they were the wrong kind. I went back to the store, this time bringing my battery with me, only to discover that they did not carry this particular kind. That's when I decided to look for it on Amazon. I found the exact battery that I used thus far - Duracell A21/23, but then I also came across these Energizer A23s. They were somewhat cheaper, but I was not sure if A23 is exactly the same as A21/23. The batteries were pretty cheap though, so I decided to give it a try. I am happy to report that they fit into my remote opener perfectly and they worked without a hitch from the get go. I am so glad that I don't have to call home from my cell phone while driving any more, asking my wife to open the garage door for me!I liked the fact that there were no shipping charges for these batteries. They seem to last for at least four to five years with my level of usage, but I decided to get an extra pair just in case. In case that they run out of power uncharacteristically early, I will write an update to this review.
B00004YK10 I don't usually buy Everready batteries, but I needed this size and the price was right on a reputable battery.
B00004YK10 I needed these for my wireless doorbell and could not find them at the local store.  They arrived promptly, were very affordable and now I can hear my doorbell again!
B00004YK10 Energizer batties last a long time..I use these batteries in my cameras..This battery was at a great price & free shipping!
B00004YK10 This size is hard to find in stores. Glad they are here on Amazon.  I use them in my ceiling fan remote and my wireless doorbell.
B00004YK10 i needed some replacement batteries for my garage door opened and was pleased to find out this battery also fits my remote on my anti-dog bark system too. nothing wrong with having spares around. no complaints what so ever.
B00004YK10 Batteries are used in various equipments at home and office. Last month I needed a set of A23 batteries and I could find them on Amazon.com. It was good for me to find them easily on Amazon and even cheaper than the market. These energizer batteries helped me to fix the door of my room. Overall it is a good product.
B00004YK10 When I go to purchase batteries of odd sizes, like the A 23, they are usually priced at $3-$6. I have other gadgets that require an off size. If I paid retail store prices for these batteries, my money wouldn't go as far, as it is when I shop at Amazon.The tip I would give, is to have a Tupperware or similar type of container, to house all of the odd size batteries. I can buy a 5-6 pack of the odd size batteries, for a fraction of buying one from a retail store; pretty crazy.
B00004YK10 this battery was super i was having trouble with my garage opener and bought this battery and it worked fine
B00004YK10 I had purchased (on Amazon) a battery operated remote door bell which I added to my front door.  Needless to say, the little 12 volt battery that came with the doorbell was an unknown brand and didn't last very long.  I could not locate the replacement battery in my local area grocery and drug stores.  I looked on Amazon and sure enough, they had them available!  I was especially pleased the batteries were Energizer, exactly the type I needed, and was a two-pack!  I really do tell my friends that if they can't find something, or if they do and it's too expensive or too far to drive to get it, look on Amazon!
B00004YK10 I've always bought energizer batteries. They seem to last longer than the other ones. Plus I grew up watching the bunny lol.
B00004YK10 I purchased these to replace in my house alarm devices and they have worked flawlessly.  The originals were off brands so I'm hoping the Energizer brand will last a long time.
B00004YK10 Works as a battery should. Works in my garage door opener remote. Good price for online purchase with free shipping.
B00004YK10 I use these batteries for my wireless doorbell. They last a long time & easy to install. Batteries are good quality.  Highly recommend
B00004YK10 Compare the price on line to the price at the retail outlet.  Now, check the expiration date on the retail outlet batteries and check them to this seller&#8217;s battery.  You can purchase the same product with equal to better shelf life at a far reduced price right here.  I highly recommend this seller.  I will never purchase batteries at the retail stores again.  Why pay retail folks.  That is just throwing your money away.
B00004YK10 Energizer A23 BatteriesHad YEARS left on use by date.
B00004YK10 Branded batteries at a nice price. Ordered these for my garage remote unit. Save the money and an unnecessary trip to the store and order here :)
B00004YK10 These little guys work as advertised and much cheaper than the local battery shop.  Normally I would buy locally but they were rude and 3 times as expensive.
B00004YK10 These 2 batteries worked great with my garage door opener. You cannot beat the price found here compared to the stores!
B00004YK10 I used these for our gated community gate clickers.  I've had some of them last more than a year.  Very happy with product and will continue to order.
B00004YK10 I bought these batteries for a doorbell chime unit (it's obviously battery operated at the doorbell).  Gee, the batteries \"look\" good; the real test is how they hold up.  This review was in November 2012; I will update this depending on how long the battery (you get two, I only needed one for the doorbell device) lasts.  It was great to purchase so cheaply on line, and shipping was free.  How great can that be?!
B00004YK10 The item worked perfectly and Amazon's price was half the price others offered it for. This battery has the energy needed.
B00004YK10 What can I say, they are Energizer Batteries and they work like Energizer Batteries do...which is great...great product for the price and they last a long time.
B00004YK10 Price for this battery is cheaper than any local retailer could come up with, and it works as advertised in my car remote.  Tested voltage on the brand new pack, and it reads about 12.5V
B00004YK10 These work great on my burglar alarm.
B00004YK10 This is the battery that fits the remote for my electrical outlets.  This battery allows me to automatically turn on and off any electrical unit that is plugged into the electrical outlets that makes life easy to turn lamps, fans etc... on and off without having to walk around to the switches on each electrical unit.  Be sure to keep these on hand.
B00004YK10 Bought these for my garage door opener. They do what they are supposed to and last longer than the generics.
B00004YK10 Could not find locally and found on Amazon!  Fast shipping and I'm pleased. This goes in a remote for a plug in lamp module switch and I like being able to turn the lamp on remotely
B00004YK10 They were a good price for what they are - batteries - what more can I say. Arrived quickly and in good condition.
B00004YK10 Works fine, what more is there to say.
B00004YK10 This is a long lasting battery.  I use it in my garage door opener, and it lasts a long, long time!
B00004YK10 It's a freeking battery. What's there to sayIt has a package which I assume cost half the price if the batteryIt's a freeking battery. What's there to sayIt is a name brandIt's a freeking battery. What's there to sayIt worked.
B00004YK10 A Battery is a Battery as far as I am concerned.  All I can tell is if it does or does not work.  These worked!
B00004YK10 I put the battery in the wireless doorbell, and the doorbell works again.  Nothing too exciting to write here other then the battery worked.
B00004YK10 Used as replacement batteries for my garage door remote control, pleased that I could order exact replacements and get them virtually over night........
B00004YK10 They are batteries and they do what they are designed to do, powered the device i got them for, and continue to supply energy to the device for a long time after.
B00004YK10 Batteries where still in date.  They arrived on time and were new in the package.  Fair price.  I would order these a
B00004YK10 These are great little batteries. I use them in our remote for our ceiling fan and they last several months, even in summer when we use the fan more often. Will continue to buy these on Amazon.
B00004YK10 I thought I was going to get the exact blister pack that was pictured but it wasn't, instead I got the retail single blister packs where the batteries are made in China.  Both work but the twin blister packs are made in the USA and lasts at least 50% longer, next time I'll ask the seller if they are selling this exact blister pack or if they are selling the 2nd rate single retail blister packs.  I won't return it for a few dollars but I would have paid an extra 2 bucks to get the originals with an expiration date printed.  I hope this helps potential buyers of this product.
B00004YK10 ENERGIZER A23 BATTERY BOUGHT IT ON AMAZON.COM FOR A WIRELESS REMOTE CONTROL OUTLET SWITCH.  THEY  ARE VERY SMALL BATTERIES, AND THEY WORK IN THE REMOTE.
B00004YK10 I was happy to find these on Amazon at a reasonable price as opposed to what you'd pay at a sporting goods store to replace the batteries in your LED flashlight.  The batteries seemed fresh and I got an excellent stream of light from the flashlight, just like new.  3 months later and they are still going strong.
B00004YK10 The is listed as a watch battery; must be one gigantic watch.  This is the replacement battery for the 3 door remote cntrol which came with my Overhead Door/Genie chair garage door opener.
B00004YK10 Energizer is the best power supply you'll ever find. it last more than duracell, it is more reliable.. I totally reccomend this battery
B00004YK10 Just what I expected. These were hard to find around town. Perfect for my thermapen. I ordered two, two packs :)
B00004YK10 Could not find any reasonably priced batteries this size at any retailers in my area.  Ordered from Amazon they came I put them in my small Garge Door Opener and tey are excellent.  Very happy with the product, they worked the first time I put them in and continue to work everyday.  The manufacturer should be proud to work with Amazon to offer these at a good price and easy access.
B00004YK10 Great product for a fraction of a price. Item arrived on time and once installed works flawlessly in my gate opener. Shelf life till 03/2016
B00004YK10 These are name brand  batteries at a good price.  What more can I say?  They were just what I ordered and they arrived on time.
B00004YK10 The overhead light/fan in my bedroom was going wonky.  I ordered new batteries.  The correct size came, in good shape, fixed the problem, and with a spare for next time.  As this is used a lot, it was critical that I get it fixed, the batteries arrived on schedule.
B00004YK10 They work, they work. The date was acceptable and wasn't expired. They do work good and have powered up the device without issue.
B00004YK10 Whether you know it or not, these batteries are actually made with 6 mini-button cell batteries stacked on top of each other. If you remove the outer casing, (NOTE: ONLY on this brand!!) you'll see them all stacked. It's a lot cheaper than buying the button cells individually when you need to replace batteries in a calculator or watch. Great price for these too!
B00004YK10 I bought these to go in my key-chain remote for my garage door opener. I have purchased this same brand in the past and it lasts for more than a year. My wife uses her remote several times a day so they really hold up well.
B00004YK10 These batteries are hard to find in the store, that's why the best place to buy them is through Amazon
B00004YK10 They're Energizers, what can I say?  Every other brand compares themselves to Duracell or Energizers, so the brand name pretty much assures quality.  These perform as expected.
B00004YK10 Liked the quality.  Nothing to dislike. Yes, I'd recommend this product for others.  What's to say about buying fresh batteries that don't expire before you get home?
B00004YK10 I have to have these batteries for my garage door opener remotes.  I have only had to replace them twice in seven years so I think they are pretty good.  It's an Energizer.  Not sure I can really say a hell of a lot else about them.  The particular seller got them to me within two days if memory serves.  So good deal.
B00004YK10 You can say abracadabra and open sesame as often as you like, but opening your garage door will remain a no-go unless you have a still functional pair of these essential A23 batteries properly inserted in your garage door opener.These are batteries and everyone knows that a battery is a battery is a battery - nothing all that profound to report in this regard.Nevertheless, these batteries are well suited to their specific purpose and do what you expect them to do: they definitely will get that garage door open when magical incantations won't.Since it's not quite my thing to get too excited about batteries, let's just give this power-packing, very reasonably priced pair 4 out of 5 stars and call it a day.Next item please!
B00004YK1A A battery either works, or it doesn't.  These work fine, and they've been working for over a month since I received them.  The non-Amazon dealer sent them fast, in their original Energizer packaging, with a far-distant expiration date.
B00004YK1A I happen to have one of those heart rate monitors that regularly eats batteries, so I am glad I ordered these, because they last about a month, which is terrific. The other &#34;regular&#34; (not extended like these) batteries pooped out in a couple of weeks. It sounds sad, but I'm thrilled about the fact that I'm only changing a battery every month. Great product at a great price.
B00004YK1A It works.  Not much else to be said.  A much better price than buying locally, and it was shipped promptly.
B00004YK1A We've bought batteries from this company before.  The card it came sealed in was printed in 2011 -- but since Energizer batteries are good for many years that is not a problem.  The important part, it works and the one of a kind little desk clock that I bought in Taiwan over 10 years ago works again -- all for a price that is at least 1/3 of what I would have paid locally.  Great dealer that ships fast.
B00004YK1A This battery is just great. I ordered one for my HP laptop's remote controller. I would rate this battery A+++++, would buy it again. Although it has not shipped yet, so I am not sure on the quality, I can guarantee this is the battery you need for your HP Pavilion entertainment PC dv6915nr with Altec Lansing speakers. I know , because I did the hard ground-level research, opening the controller, finding the battery, removing the battery, examining the battery, finding the name of the battery, replacing the battery, closing the battery containment area, and so on.
B00004YK1A It's a battery. It does what it's supposed to.Great value for buying from Amazon since there's no tax and it's cheaper than the ones sold in Target or Walmart.
B00004YK1A Ordered this from Best Deal Supply and it fit my watch perfectly.  I was a bit skeptical but it was not expired and was legitimate.
B00004YK1A Energizer does not let you down. These batteries are lasting very well. I would definitely buy them again, when needed.
B00004YK1A Energizer Lithium Coin Watch/Electronic Battery, 3 Volts, Ecr2450 .. energizer! The only way to go for your battery needs! Shop smart!
B00004YK1A Great working batteries at a great price. I have only needed to use on from the pack so far, but my watch has been working well for over 3 months, since putting in the battery.
B00004YK1A Does what it's supposed to do. Why does anyone have to write more than what is required to describe the product?
B00004YK1A I've been using these in one of those counter-irritant conductor devices that zaps you with electronic jolts to reduce or eliminate temporarily what ails you.  I've tried several other 2025s, but the Energizer is definitely stronger and longer lasting.  This price represents a 33% reduction compared to Walgreen's.
B00004YK1A Sure these batteries are good. They last about three years in my alarm remote. I get them through Amazon's free shipping offer when I have $25 or more worth of purchases. The box store charges 5 bucks a piece for these (if you can find them) and Amazon charges less then half. Kind of a no-brainer to me.
B00004YK1A This watch battery works well and has a very reasonable package. The price is a bit high. Disadvantage is that you need to distinguish that with CR2032 since the thickness are different. Recommend that for use!
B00004YK1B It's such a pain to drive to the convenience store and these are out of stock, or you forget the style number you need.  Energizer through Amazon delivers exactly what you need, when you need it!
B00004YK1B I haven't tested this battery so just going by the fact it works and my digital scale is bright and readable,  package was in good condition and battery is new and sealed.
B00004YK1B I bought theEnergizer ECR2032 Watch Batteryfor our bathroom scale, and expected it to last a year or more, like the original battery did. However, it is weakening after only a few months. I bought the battery December 2009, but it had a manufacturing date of July 2009. Could it be that the battery was too old? Is this short lifespan a problem with the battery in general, or these batteries in particular? I don't know.At this price, though, I cannot complain too much. Free shipping with Amazon Prime makes this an incredibly good deal, so I ordered another one. Hopefully, it will last a bit longer. The packaging this time is different (not the same as the picture shown), but the battery is still old--February 2010.
B00004YK1B .I've used these...they're fine, but I prefer the 5-packs, such as Maxell CR2032 lithium ion batteries (pack of 5 ) orCR2032 Maxell Lithium 5 Batteries.A much better deal, and the shelf life is usually 5+ years (unless you get stale ones from a poorly rated merchant).
B00004YK1B The batteries do not come in the individual retail packaging as pictured, but are from a bulk roll (I put a picture above). The only reason this really matters is because they don't have an expiration date so you can't be sure how fresh they are so for now they only get 4 stars. Other than that, they do appear to be authentic Energizer battery and the price is very good. I will be using these in my bathroom scales and will report back on the battery life.
B00004YK1B I needed a replacement battery for my car key; I received a battery in simple packaging. The battery was, as one would hope, in fine condition. Good price, arrived on time. That's what I was looking for.
B00004YK1B I used these to replace the battery for my car's intelligent key.  They work fine, but it is too early to tell how long they will last.
B00004YK1B This is the best deal for batteries.  I used to pay $5.99 for each 2032 battery at Walgreens, now I pay $1.45 each on Amazon, do the math?  I was being ripped off all my previous life.  These 2032 batteries delivered fast and they were fully charged, and free shipping.
B00004YK1B I needed to purchase this battery for a calculator.  Calculator is going strong and do not look for the battery to wear out anytime soon.
B00004YK1B There was no good till date on my packaging. This was taken off a strip of batteries not what is posted. No date on package. Does it expire 2013?
B00004YK1B These are a good replacement for most PC motherboard CMOS batteries, which ideally should be retired after 3 to 4 years. I have also been using these for my LCD desk clock, which runs for a little more than a year before a new battery is needed.
B00004YK1B This was a great value.It was cheaper than anywhere I could find in the stores like Target or Safeway. No tax too.Plus since I have Amazon Prime, shipping was free without having to buy over $25 of items.
B00004YK1B I hate reviews that say something to the effect \"It's a battery. What else can I say?\". Answer: Nothing! Please don't write and waste space (as I've done here).
B00004YK1B Energizer makes good quality batteries.  This is the one that matched my remote control.  Would rather buy a brand name than a generic.
B00004YK1B they fit perfectly in my two computers and they are still working great to keep the time accurate and to help the cmos store the information properly. the price was great and i am very happy i bought them.
B00004YK1B While these seem to be acceptable batteries, they are NOT packaged as shown.  I was wary of these batteries because they came packaged in a strip of five.  So far, they have performed well.  I am just not satisfied these are really new Energizer batteries as shown.
B00004YK1B No big. Sale price on oldies with decent expirations stamped.Cheaper than the local stores, so give it a whirl.My vehicle fob needed it badly, but I only got 1-2 months' use before replacement time came again.Hmmmm.
B00004YK1B Forgot to check the date, but installed in alarm clock and works. A o k. Much cheaper than in local stores.PS- just found package- expiration date of battery is 3/2019!!!
B00004YK1B The batteries seem to be fresh - I couldn't see a date on the packaging as they came from a blister pack.They look like they're doing their job so far but it's only been a couple of weeks - only time will tell if they last long.Other than that - fast shipping and packaged OK.
B00004YK1B I had to get a new battery for my XM radio remote control. This was the size I needed, but I never thought about getting it on Amazon. I went to the drug store and paid over $5.00 for the same battery. When I went home to install it I thought I would just check to see if Amazon had one online. Sure enough, I bought this one and took the one I purchased from the drug store back for a refund. I even told the counter person that I had to return it due to the price. So far the battery works just fine.
B00004Z4AE I use Renaissance wax for micro polishing of all metals, and for woods of any finish.  The secret to using it is hand rubbing, as opposed to the way you wax your car.  It cleans and polishes while laying down a coat of preservative wax.  This 0000 pad from 3M is perfect for the application.  You can use the less fine pad (they use different colors for different coarseness/fineness), especially on steel tools.I use 0000 steel wool.  But sometimes you do not want to risk leaving any of those fine steel fibers behind to rust.  These pads actually hold their shape better than wools, which tend to separate under pressure, so these go further.I also like these pads for pumice and rottenstone, getting a good load of paraffin oil.  You get good control over them for polishing and fine abrasive work.  I can size them for fingertip work or for whole flat hand coverage.You cannot do a French Polish with them, but they are suited to the alternative, Qualasole, of for any other rubbing finishes like tung, linseed or Danish penetrating oils.Check out 3M's whole line of grades, but this is the one I buy most often.  I would not use this fine 0000 grade for scrubbing pots because it will choke with caked on food too fast.  But for the above, it earns all five stars even though it does not completely replace 0000 steel wool.
B00004Z4AE I got this to clean up some iron jewelry that had rusted a bit. It worked for that. Of course, we're using them on dishes, too.  They seem tougher than steel wool and don't have the unpleasant smell.
B00004Z4AE Steel wool replacement my butt. You can go to the fish store and buy the filter pads that come in like a 1' X 1' sheet and cut your self up 6 of them.
B00004Z4AE This is a great alternative to steel wool for cleaning kitchen pots. It removes most baked on eggs and pancakes. It won't rust and doesn't contain any soap like chemicals like most steel wools.
B00004Z4AE Good size, alot in the box, well worth it. Helps cleaning light rust easily and considering how soft it is, no damage was done to the item.
B00004Z4EG I received the steel wool but have not used it yet.  I will let everyone know what I think hopefully after this weekend when I continue refinishing my Dresser and Mirror set.UPDATE:  I did use some of these on the above mentioned dresser and am very pleased with them.  They are very durable and a good price.  I highly recommend these for anyone who needs this type of steelwool pad!!!!
B00004Z4EG Nice pack, brings alot. I used it to scrub the neck of my guitar to remove dead skin and all other s*** on it, and then used Bore oil on it. Neck looks brand new.
B00004Z4EG This is very good steel wool.  Use it on stainless steel, wood cabinets and wood flooring.  Doesn't leave residue as some othersdo.  Would buy again.
B00004Z4EG We saw a mouse and i knew where it was getting in. I stuffed steel wool into the hole with a screw driver and then followed that with this foam. The mouse stopped using that hole but still kept making its way in. I found its escape route and got the little bastard the next night with a trapThis steelwool did its job and now we have a ton leftover, its good quality stuff. I like it more then those Brillo pads
B00004Z4EG These are steelwool pads, what can you say. Nothing wrong with them. Worked just great on chrome on my tricycle. For me these were a good deal on Amazon.
B00004Z4EG This is a cheap, large quantity of steelwool. It does exactly what it's supposed to do, nothing particularly exciting or negative.
B00004Z4EG Good for the price. Fast shipping, great value!I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys woodworking or anything that requires steel wool.
B00004Z4EG I use 4/0 steel wool often for many wood related projects; however, lately I have changed directions slightly and applied steel wool to open holes in interior walls where pipes or other building parts interact for the sole purpose to reduce our population of unwanted visitors.Wood often gets the final dusting of steel wool combined with shellac or some other type of finish protector just after using 400 grade sandpaper and it does an excellent job for me.  As soon as this pack arrived I took out one pad and attacked the windows on the SUV to rid the exterior surfaces of summers' bugs and other unwanted products.  4/0 is best because it removes the dead critters, mostly bugs, with ease and little to zero chance of scratching the surface.  The added benefit is real clean windows.  Thanks to our changing weather conditions around here we and several of our neighbors have had outdoor visitors feel as if they were welcome inside.  The key is to eliminate the means in which they can enter.  One of those is the holes where pipes come in from washing machines or water facilities from the wells and on and on.  I pack each entry hole that will not carry electricity with steel wool and the 4/0 is best because if you are a mouse and begin to eat steel you might get an urge for an antacid or stool softener.  After packing the holes I further close them by using expanding foam and now we have not only critter proofed the house but we reduced the amount of air exchange from out to in.Great product and so handy to just keep on hand.
B00004Z4EG Great price for a quality item. I Have bought other wool that came rusted and packaged very poorly. Great product.
B00004Z4EG For only $5 it is a lot of Steelwool. I didn't need that much but now i have a big package laying around my house. Starts fires good.
B00004Z4EG I love this stuff! I used it on a couple of tables that had some nasty deep gashes and this helped to smooth them out. thx.
B00004Z4EG This was a good pack of steel wool lightly packed but it will do what we purchased it for.  Happy with buy.
B00004Z6TW I've used APC products for many years, and in spite of the relatively high price compared to other brands like Tripp Lite, Belkin, etc., I've always been pleased with APC's level of quality.  This particular purchase is my second \"refill\" for a long-lasting BP-500CLR that's gone way past its warranty period and keeps on tickin'.  Though I like Tripp Lite's products in general, their batteries haven't lasted as long as APC's.
B00004Z6TW Not much to say. I put this cartridge into my APC back-up, charged it, connected it to my equipment and all is well. Can't tell about longevity yet.
B00004Z6TW The APC battery is an exact replacement though sadly its made in Vietnam of all places! Personally if Amazon put the country of origin in its product description I would have looked elsewhere bu then maybe thats why they DONT put it in the description!
B00004Z6TW I purchased this because several reviews said that this comes with a prepaid label to dispose of the old battery. It does not. If I had known that, I would have paid a couple extra dollars and bought an original equipment battery from APC rather than this third-party knockoff.
B00004Z6TW We needed a replacement battery for a UPS, looked up the model, found this online.  Replacement was very easy and it has been working fine, no problems.
B00004Z6TW I am writing as a word to those like me who have to replace their APC UPS batteries.  I have a BACKUPS-XS1500 LCD uninteruptable power supply and recently needed to replace the batteries.  I didn't realize until I pulled out the APC batteries and realized there was a brand name below the white APC label that APC had slapped over the sides of the batteries, in essence putting their name on someone else's battery products.  Mine was a company named Vision.  Based on research, I discovered that APC utilizes a variety of battery manufacturers and slapped their labels on them and charges a premium.  With that being said, it is not necessary to buy an APC labeled battery for your UPS.  Find a name brand that you are comfortable with that fits the specifications of your battery.  You can, like I did, pull the label off and see who the true manufacturer is and the specifications.  In my case, I have a dual battery, meaning I have to buy two individual 12 Volt batteries and put them together into my UPS.So it is not necessary to pay a premium for a APC labeled battery, just go with a reasonably priced option that has a name brand and good reviews and you will be fine.
B00004Z6TW This is the second replacement battery I've purchased for my SmartUps SC 420.  The first battery lasted about two years, the replacement about the same, so I'm expecting about two years out of this one.  Always been very happy with the battery replacements and a much cheaper alternative to replacing the whole UPS.
B00004Z6TW I needed to replace a failed battery in a Back-UPS 500 and this was the ticket. I was concerned with buying knock off battery and having it fail quickly, so I spent a few extra bucks for the APC unit. It's been fine for several months now and I hope to get a few years life out of it.
B00004Z6TW Bought this to replace a battery in one of our battery backups for our computer at our work.  Worked perfectly!
B00004Z6TW I somehow added the wrong battery to my cart, and since it's hazardous cannot return it.The one I received was in great condition, and will work with my other Back-UPS (it didn't need a new battery, but I guess I got one now..) These are really easy to swap in and out, so you don't have to buy a whole new unit.
B00004Z6TW I have an old APC UPS that uses this battery, and every 2-3 years, the battery dies.  I always replace it with a genuine APC battery because then I get free mail-in recycling.  I wouldn't know what to do with my old battery otherwise.One way you can tell if it's genuine APC is if it includes instructions on how to send the battery back to APC for recycling.  I purchased my batter from \"Amazon.com LLC\", and it is genuine.  I removed the old battery and put the new one in, and my UPS works great now.  I expect it to last another 2-3 years.
B000050AUB This is one of those items, that make you at first think, eh I have mixed feelings. After your gums get accustomed to the massage, and the intensity of the brushing, you will know that it is one of the single best things you have done to your smile.When flossing, my gums used to bleed, now they don't bleed any more. I had gum lines that were receding, even though some of them were only back 1 to 3 on a scale of 10. I had a wisdom tooth that incurred periodontal disease, The dentist went around it with a metal probe, to release the infection, and gave me a prescription for antibiotics. He explained that it would be healed, but still must be pulled because it would for sure return. I guess once that infection gets down under the tooth, it sets up shop, and returns. I had to go to a dental surgeon and have it removed. After that, I got a scolding from the dental hygienist. She explained that all the the bleeding that I was getting from my gums when flossing was not normal. It was due to bacteria. So I started to scrub more often, and floss, and use an alcohol based mouthwash. (Most of them are)It wasn't until I started to use the Sonicaire toothbrush that I really noticed a change. No more bleeding gums (unless I abuse the floss) My gums have moved down. I had a crown placed on a tooth that was far enough gone, that when the crown was put on, I could take a fingernail, and push the gum up slightly, and feel the top of the crown. Now I push the gum up with my fingernail, and the top of the crown is entirely inaccessable.Why should you get a Sonicaire toothbrush? Consider that most tooth aches come from Gingivitus. That is an irritation of the gum line. Tartar and plaque join forces with bacteria, and wage a war with your gum line. Scrubbing with baking soda and some peroxide used to take care of that for me.(Being careful not to swallow any of it.) Now with Sonicaire, I never get Gingivitus any more. The next level is Periodontal disease as I explained earlier. Once you get that, if it is a crown, or a tooth, they are forced to do bridgework. I don't know if you have checked the prices on bridgework, but forget about that new car. Regular brushing with Sonicaire, with regular dental check ups, flossing, and a good mouthwash, and you can help prevent all of that. Now let's get on to the fun stuff.I can notice a substantial improvement in the color of my teeth. They are white now, instead of manila. (I won't say yellow) Seriously, I smile in the mirror with the light on, just to delight in the new shade of white my teeth have become.On a practical note: I use the Sonicaire in the shower, even though the instructions tell you not to. Immersing the unit, is definitely not advisable. Rinsing it off after every use is neccessary. Therefore I took it upon myself to use it in the shower, being careful to park it on a ledge that is not in the line of any overspray. Then when I am done with my massage, I mean brushing, :-) I give it a quick rinse, holding it straight up, so the business end is not getting force fed. I haven't had any problems with it. I really like using it in the shower, makes me feel like it is a luxury massage for my teeth. I even renew the toothpaste application, to the head, for my lower teeth. The unique thing is that the head is vibrating so fast, that if you would take it out of your mouth in front of the mirror, you would have a clean up job to do afterwords. A zillion little bits of toothpaste would be splattered about. A problem that disappears when using it in the shower.The unit keeps a good charge. About once a week, I put it back int the charger. Interestingly, is that their isn't any of the usual metal contacts associated with a charger. The unit is sealed, as is the base. So when it is in the charger, it somehow moves through the plastic in the base into the charger without any direct metal contact. When the unit loses a charge, it tells you by flashing a light inside the on and off button. Takes the guesswork out of it.I had bought their kit with the multiple heads earlier. I just bought this unit for my mother as a gift.One last benefit that I want to mention, is that it enables you to get a really good brushing in areas of your mouth, that you may not brush as well due to accessability. Since the unit is doing all of the work, you no longer need a long staging area to get a sweeping motion going. You just place the Sonicaire on the spot, and the rapid pulsing, gives that area a great brushing.I have to admit, that when I got the unit at first, I thought, wow this thing is aggressive. I guess that is why the manufacturer programs it to go easy for the first couple of weeks, gradually building up to a full speed. After a while, it feels like normal brushing to you, and a standard brushing with a manual toothbrush seems like a poor excuse for the job.Get this Sonicaire toothbrush. You will be glad you did. Hope this helps.
B000050AUB After I bought one of these and started using it, my dentist noticed how much better my teeth were and made a note on my record that I use a Sonicare. I used to have to go three to four times a year to have tartar removed and now I don't have to go as often. So this toothbrush paid for itself in less than a year. Plus it feels so wonderful after brushing. The charge holds plenty long, the timer is a nice feature to make sure you brush long enough. Buy enough replacement heads, because the brush works better if you replace the heads every few months. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth, and I certainly do it after drinking coffee. My teeth look a lot whiter.
B000050AUB I've always thought I did a good job brushing, but when a relative (who works at a dentist's office) got us one of these, I was amazed. My teeth felt SO much cleaner, and they made a big difference in dental checkups for both of us.I'd highly recommend this to just about anyone - good tooth and gum care is really important, and this tool helps make it easy!
B000050AUB We have 3 of these, and have been pleased since the beginning (about 3 years ago). Your mouth will feel wonderful after each use (though it takes a bit of getting used to, and beginners are warned to use the included damping ring to decrease the intensity for a while). We have had 2 occasions to return one to the factory, but they were replaced under warranty with little fuss (both dead batteries). There have been subtle changes as newer models have come out. I like this latest itineration best, as its tiny green LED on the on/off switch makes an adequate navigational beacon through a dark bathroom. One word of caution: my family will not travel without these things, so while I preach 'pack light', they tote their Sonics everywhere we go. Fortunately, one charge lasts at least a week, so the charging base is only needed on extended trips.
B000050AUB A fantastic toothbrush that really helps your gums. At first it might feel a bit uncomfortable, but you'll get used to it in a week or two. The battery is sufficient for road trips. All in all, I can't see going back to a regular toothbrush. One tip: do not use with toothpaste; gels spread more evenly.
B000050AUB Gimmicky tech stuff drives me crazy, but this product is worth every penny you pay for it.  Although you might be used to scrubbing your teeth (and I admit that can be therapeutic at times), the super-charged foam will actually do a much more thorough job of ridding your teeth of plaque.  My oral hygenist said that use of the Sonicare has made my normally very good-looking gums fabulously heatlhy.  I'm another person that wishes I had had one years ago; it may have helped me prevent the loss of a tooth.My oldest son's orthodontist gave him a Sonicare, because they believe it is the most effective toothbrush for cleaning teeth with braces.  We're buying another for my younger son, as he now has a retainer. The sensation of using it may be a little unusual at first, but you will quickly become used to it.  Believe me, you want this product!
B000050AUB Pros:  Does a great job of cleaning teeth, and it's easy and comfortable to use.However, it's not without problems.  First off, mine has developed cracks around the handle that are *slowly* propogating through the plastic.  Never dropped the thing or treated it roughly - it just started cracking after a month or two.  I'll have to hope they cover it under warranty if it finally falls apart.My main complaint, however, is the lack of easily replaceable batteries (note that the Braun and Interplak are guilty of this as well).  It seems horribly obnoxious - as well as environmentally irresponsible - to charge this much for a product that's going to have to be thrown away after a couple of years when the NiCd's go.  Instead of a ... battery, you're stuck buying another ... toothbrush...yeesh.
B000050AUD The Sonicare toothbrush is really a breakthrough. I've had mine for almost a year (on the advice of my dentist as well as other Sonicare owners), and it works extremely well.Not only does this device make brushing my teeth quicker and more relaxing, but they simply get cleaner. More important, my dentist says the health of my gums (leading cause of tooth loss) is extremely good since I started using the Sonicare.The feature where it beeps every 30 seconds is pretty useless, and the auto-off after 2 minutes is downright annoying (I like to brush for 3-4 minutes).The brush can run for a week between recharges, and the charging stand is small and attractive. The whole thing is easy to keep clean, quite well designed.One caution: you need to replace the brush head every 6 months.... However, it's worth it for better dental and gum health.
B000050AUD I bought this toothbrush system wondering if it really lived up to the hype. At first I noticed that it was too aggressive. My teeth and gums weren't used to it. I thought I had clean teeth, and would brush regularly. After visiting my dentist for a cleaning, the dental assistant razzed me about my gums bleeding when I flossed. She said that was due to bacteria. So I brushed and flossed, and used mouthwash, and that helped. Then I bought the Sonicaire toothbrush, and that made all the difference. Now when I floss, their isn't any blood, or at best an occassional little bit. This system really works.I had a tooth that was other than a few thin shell walls, down to my gumline. The dentist was able to save it, and install a crown. I noticed that I could take a fingernail and pick at the top of the tooth where it met the gum. After using the Sonicaire system, my gums have healed and moved down so much that it is impossible for me to push them out of the way enought to feel that crown top anymore. When gums recede due to plaque and bacteria, that is when we get gingivitus, and even worse, periodontal disease, which results in having to remove the tooth. Do yourself a favor. A stitch in time truly saves nine. Buy this Sonicaire toothbrush system. You can not afford not to. It will save you way more than the purchase price in dental bills.Now when I use it, their isn't even a little bit of discomfort. I even consider it a massage of sorts. I use it in the shower, even though the instructions tell you not to. I am careful not to submerge it, or get it too wet. You need to rinse it off after every use anyhow, so a quick rinse under the shower, keeping it held straight up, works great. I have had it for over 6 months, and the brush is still in like new shape.The kit comes with more than one brush head, which is a savings if you are using it for more than one person in the house. If you are just using it for yourself, one head is enough. It is a savings to buy this kit though, because the multiple heads are a bargain over purchasing them individually. In the long run you will need a new head.Sonicaire programs the unit to start of mild, then increase over the first couple of weeks use to full strength. Now even at full strength I do not experience any discomfort.I have an 88 year old mother who due to mild arthritis, is unable to grasp a regular toothbrush very well. With the Sonicaire, then body is light, yet large, and does all the brushing for you. If  you have a parent like that, this makes a great gift.Even if you are just buying it for yourself, buy it, and have the toughest gums, and brightest teeth on the block. I am sorry that I wasn't able to have one of these for all time. Hope this was helpful.
B000050AUD I purchased this tooth brush about five years or more ago. I have used it continually with the exception of a few in between spurts of just not using it.  Like vacation, moving, etc.  My dentist always ask me what do I do to keep my teeth so free of plaque.  I explained it was my Sonic tooth brush.  She complimented me at every six month visit.  I moved across country and my tooth brush was packed and I use the manual for a while and before long I began to feel pain and bleeding on one side around the gum line on my back teeth.  I found my sonic, charged it and in about a week my teeth and gums were back to normal.  My teeth feel very smooth and clean, somewhat like they feel after the dentist cleans them and they feel cleaner longer after brushing than with a manual tooth brush.  I would recommend that anyone that cares about their teeth to sacrafice and purchase the Sonic Tooth brush.  They want be sorry.  I certainly am not.  Mine has lasted for over five years without any problems.  If this one wear out I certainly hope Sonic stay in business so I can re-buy.....
B000050AUD This is a great toothbrush!The vibration from this toothbrush leaves a lasting tingle in my mouth that I find quite pleasant and somewhat relaxing.Not only are my teeth clean -- feeling as if I'd just returned from the dentist -- I'm able to reach all the way to my back molars and not gag on the toothbrush.  Also, the 2-minute timer beeps and pauses every 30 seconds which helps me concentrate on the task at hand.The power unit comes with three brush heads that should last me for a year.  The rechargeable base and brush handle are sturdy and neither has exposed contacts so there&#65533;s no worry about corrosion or shorting of electricity.  It would be nice, however, if the brush handle had a better seal so that it could withstand a quick rinse under the faucet.The only thing I don't like about this toothbrush is that it seems to set off my salivary glands causing me to drool.  Can't really blame that on the toothbrush, though.Aside from the drool, brushing just shouldn't be this much fun.  It's just not right.  Enjoy!
B000050AUD This toothbrush is well worth the money.  It feels strange at first but you'll be amazed at how clean your teeth are and how healthy your gums look after a few uses.I struggled to get my husband to brush his teeth more than once a day--I was concerned about the health of his gums.  Since purchasing this toothbrush he uses it 2-3 times a day.  You always know that you're brushing for the recommended time, that you're removing plaque, and you're not brushing too hard and damaging enamel.  The super-clean feeling in your mouth encourages you to brush frequently.Our teeth are whiter through the use of this brush alone--no bleach or &quot;whitening&quot; toothpaste needed.  Bad breath is no longer a problem, either, now that our gums are healthier.In addition, the unit has a sleek, modern design that looks good in the bathroom.  The brush heads have a ventilated, plastic cover to protect them from dust, etc.I am going to buy this for everyone in my family next Christmas.  It's that good!
B000050B6B Great new shave after using them. I like how Amazon tells you when you order a product like this the date of the last order.  I had gone a little too long with my old heads, big difference with new.
B000050B6B No I didn't have an object pointed at me when I placed the order but at twice the original price what else can I say.This mimics a collectible price....but I opened the box.
B000050B6B Be sure you have the correct model number wrote down and make sure these are the blades you use and need. I looked for a while and found these blades were the best price I could find. If you can't wait for them to be delivered check for stores in your area for them and see if you can buy them at the price they are without the postage and handling charges. They may be a few bucks more but you will have them in your hands.
B000050B6B I've had many Norelco razors in my 50 years of shaving with all being renewedwith a fresh set of heads after a few years. Every Norelco I owned always failedthe switch so be mindful of that if you want new heads.Switch OK? Then buy new heads and keep on shavin'
B000050B6B These replacement heads are perfect for my Dad's old razor. He said it works just like new. I hope they become available again.
B000050B6B Said it would work for the shaver my husband has and didn't.  Just through it in the trash.  For the price of the heads one can almost buy a new shaver.  So that is what I will continue to do without any compaints from my husband that we should be buying heads.  Wrong.
B000050B6D Anyone who rates these replacement blade heads lower than five stars should be b*tch slapped back to Mongolia.These blades basically turned my old Norelco into a brand new electric shaver! I was *this* close to junking my shaver and buying a nice late-model electric shaver until I came across these 'Made in Holland' replacement blade heads. I don't recall my shaver ever working this well. Thanks Amazon!
B000050B6D The replacement heads ordered on line from Amazon arrived on the day promised.  I have installed the blades and the razor shaves like new.  It is a nine year old Norelco.  Each year I replace the blades and experience a close, even shave--just like it was when the razor was new.
B000050B6D Excellent product but a little pricy, relatively speaking.If you own a rotary shaver, then you're going to have to get new blades at some point.  The high cost of these replacement blades makes me second-guess my decision to purchase a rotary shaver, to begin with!Oh well...I'm stuck having to continue buying these blades, unless somebody develops a means with which to effectively sharpen the old blades. I just can't bring myself to throw away my ($$$) rotary shaver. That thing cost me a hundred bucks!
B000050B6D I have used Norelco and their blades for years and am satisfied with their performance.  The shavers last for years and the blades are easy to install.  Nonetheless, the blades seem particularly expensive and pairing blade to shaver can be confusing. Seriously, how many model numbers for a particular line can one company generate?
B000050B6D Old Norelco is much better than a new one. Research discovered the old one has TWO AA-sized NiCads. Low-end models only have one. More power means the heads spin faster. Battery store replaced them for $20. Replaced the heads, HQ6 which are hard to find. Shaver is as good as new for less than a new high-end shaver. Don't buy a cheap shaver, invest in a good one and spend a little on keeping it in good running order.
B000050B6D works as it should, I have since moved on to shaving cream and a razor as I am not a kid anymore and like a smooth clean shave. with an electric razor I have NEVER had a shave as clean as a razor blade can give.
B000050B6D Works just fine, costs too much. I don't like throwing out razors and try to use them until they are in really bad shape. Replacing the blades instead of throwing the whole unit in the trash for a new one is more ecologically sound, but these blade refills, even on sale, cost almost as much as a cheap shaver.
B000050B6D This Philips Norelco HQ6 Replacement Head was an exact fit replacement for the worn out one on my shaver.  It was easy to install, and brought my shaver back almost to the original shave quality.  It seems to be holding up well.This replacement head was difficult to get locally, and the Amazon price was the best I found anywhere on line.
B000050B6D Our son went to see the opera \"The Barber of Seville\" today with his fourth grade classmates. Not only was it reportedly over 3 hours long, but the singing was in Italian (which is fine, but was not, as promised, in English), it took more than 30 minutes just to get out of the parking garage, and there were no snacks!I mention this not only because I love our son, but also because I was wondering how Figaro (said barber) would have liked these refills for the Norelco Quadra 7 and Quadra Action rechargeable electric razor.  I imagine he would have loved the shaver  (see separate review for the Norelco 6826XL), but that at some point he'd have sung a dramatic aria about the need to semi-regularly change your blades.It's easy to neglect changing the blades, as the Norelco works wonderfully and the deterioration is imperceptible at first. But after about 2 years on the SAME SET OF BLADES the performance is noticeably worse.  This neatly packaged replacement set is easy to use  (but try to keep the two part razor head and blade together as you place them in the shaver), the price seems reasonable, and it shaves again as if it were new: fast, smooth, close.  The box indicates that it replaces blades for models7885/7866/7865/7864/7845/7825/6891/6887/6886/6885/6857/6866/6865/6848/6829/6828/6826XL/7617/7616X,but then confusingly adds, \"Not all Quadra model numbers may be listed.\" It states also \"DOES NOT FIT ANY OTHER NORELCO MODELS  (presumably this means they fit Quadra 7 and Quadra Action Razors only).\"  My one complaint is an environmental/engineering one-why was a big box used for shipping such a small item?The fat lady sings; the review is over. Thank you for your patience.
B000050B6D I purchased these Philips Norelco replacement heads for my husbands electric shaver. They were easy to replace and worked perfectly.
B000050B6D After SEVEN years, my husband decided it was finally time to replace the original blades that came with his Norelco. These work fantastic, as expected. They seem to provide almost as close of a shave as a razor blade. Overall, very pleased.
B000050B6D I have previously used a triple head Norelco razor that was corded so I decided to try a cordless product and got it at a reasonably discounted price in my Gold Box.  I don't really think there should be much adjustment for me because I was already using the old model.  I agree that the shave is very close but I have to really work at it and it takes as long to shave as ever. I have tried to use pre-electric shave and simply wash and dry my face with equal results.  I tried shaving with a cord connected and without the cord and the RPM's of the unit seems to be about the same.  It is exceedingly quiet and is quite smooth over my face after the shave.  Cleaning is simple, just washing it.  I plan to continue to use it for the next several weeks to get a fair trial.  Although it was a little bit more expensive than I would have liked, it seems to be a decent shaver.  I give it 4 stars simply because it doesn't make shaving any faster for me.
B000050B6D I've used these replacement heads twice.  The body and battery still functions well.  I forget how good the new heads are until I begin to get razor burns.  After replacement, the razor is like new...maybe better! A less expensive alternative and environmentally friendly.
B000050B6D I called Norelco and was told this was the head for one of my husbands shavers.  It was not, so it was a waste of money to buy these.  I have returned them but have postage expenses.
B000050B6D I'm a Norelco guy and have been for years since trying a couple of others when I first started to shave.  Past cutter heads have been quite worthy and satisfactory so I don't expect anything different for this order.
B000050B6D These are replacement blades for my razor. They work great and I change them once a year. The price is a little high, but beats buying a new electric razor.
B000050B6Z I shave with a straight razor and have always wanted a hot foam dispencer, so voil&agrave;!Pros: Easy to use, easy to clean, cheap, cheap to refill, reliable, hot foam!Cons: A small one, but you have to warm it up (duh)...it only takes a minute or two.Bottom Line: If you want a hot lathery shave at a VERY affordable price, then look no further. This is it!
B000050B6Z 1) So difficult to get the can inside and lined up to the hole2) Even if you get the can connected, it falls out all the time3) the foam is either always cold or searing hot4) no way to control the temp of the lather5) horrible
B000050B6Z All conairs hot lather machines are a scam. be ware you are not going to get the barber's nice hot lather. You will get luke warm lather very thin in nature. The machine will fail in very short amount of time
B000050B6Z This hot lather machine worked good and lasted a long time.Hot lather makes a shave more comfy, this is easier than messing with hot towels-
B000050B6Z I have had very little problem with this unit. Now & then, when trying to get the lather to come out slowly, you will get a little bit of very hot water in your hand right when the lather first starts to come out. It's not comfortable, but doesn't really burn. The lather, itself, comes out nice and warm and feels very good on the face. Whether it actually helps your shave or not, I have no idea; I haven't really noticed a difference. The great benefit is the nice warm lather on your face.
B000050B6Z Thought my dad might like this, but sent him something else. My hubby is too rigid in how he does stuff to even try it. I may try it someday. So, unless a person who wants to use it themselves orders this, it'll just be in the back of the cabinet.
B000050FDE this is my third Oral-B toothbrush and it's the best one yet, faster, more powerful, works great and lots of features I wasn't expecting.
B000050FDE REPLACED AN OLD ONE OF THE SAME BRAND NAME.I bought this toothbrush to replace one of the same brand name that I had for about 3-4 years.  The old one just broke.  Since I was pleased with it I decided to pick up this one.  One positive thing for doing that, is that it used the same brush ends and I had stock piles of them.  It is nice that I could use these and not have to buy new ones... at [money amount] each.EASY TO CLEAN STORAGE THINGThis one has a nice little storage thing for the tooth brushes.  This at first had me worried as the back of the toothbrushes, no matter how well you rinse and dry them, still drip, water and accumulated toothpaste at times.  Not to worry though.  This storage thing lifts right out and can be easily cleaned.BETTER DESIGNED TOOTHBRUSH HANDLE:The toothbrush handle is also an improvement on its predecessor.  It is slimmer and longer and has a better gripping surface.REALLY FAST BRUSHING BUT TWO SPEEDS AVAILABLE:The one thing that took a while to get used to though was the speed..  This thing is zippy.  Luckily there are two speeds, but even the lowest is much faster than my old one.  However, you get used to it quick.  I also honestly think, it does a slightly better job.  Or maybe I do, due to the more manueverable handle.Nice product, I would buy it all over again.
B000050FDE After using one for 7 years or so the old professional gave out finally.  The NEW one I had to buy at Target (sorry Amazon when your toothbrush is broke asap is more important then price).  I did the full charge last night and let it run down without a brush on and I am charging it back up to full.  Just got done using it again before bed.  This electric toothbrush is better then their last model and more powerful.  I can tell by how clean my teeth are.  Thanks a bunch Oral B for the High Quality Product.
B000050FDE I originally purchased thinking I was going to get a 50% cash back. But that seems to not have worked but I am still pleased to have this now.Follow the 3o-second procedures and it works great.Definitely worth it from normal brushing. My gums bled at first but have now stopped. Floss at least once a day still recommended.Good luck with the Oral-B Toothbrush it won't let you down.Brushing takes a few days to get used to.
B000050FDE This is my first electric toothbrush and I am amazed at how clean my teeth and mouth feel after using this.  I could never go back to a manual brush.  My only complaint is that my brush dies after just five minutes, so I need to keep mine charged at all times.  It's a minor complaint considering how clean my teeth feel after using this.Replacement brushes are a tad expensive, but I find it worth it.
B000050FDE I think I've owned this for five years now and it is still working great.  My only issue is that the brush starts to come apart after maybe 6 months of use, and pinches your lips gums etc, forcing you to change the brush.  Probably should change it anyway, but I don't like it when a company forces things on you this way. This is the first toothbrush I ever owned which has a brush which falls apart and hurts you like this.
B000050FDE I bought this as a gift, and the recipient was quite happy with it.  So far it seems comfortable, easy to use, dependable, and to do the trick it was purchased for.  It was an excellent value.
B000050FDE As time goes on in life we often find out that we've been doing everything all wrong. We look back at our deterioting health and notice that had we made the adjustments then, we would be ding much much better now. When you get a tooth brush like this you can't help but hate your parents a little bit. I grew up with the belief that a medium tooth brush and good hard brushing was the way. Then I started to get yelled at by my dentist for ripping my gums out. I at the time thought that unless you brush like you mean it, your not going to get your teeth clean. Then, I was turned on to soft bristled tooth brushes. I thought that was the way, then a few years later I got a battery operated tooth brush and for a while thought that nothing could top it. Now comes this, it's an amazing blend of genius for good hydgine keepers, and a blend of idiot proof add on's for people like me that have been brushing to hard for their entire lives. The bristles are soft, if holds a charge for well over a week and pressing to hard will shut the brush down as doing so will actually cause more damage than good. The tooth brush itself is nice and form fitting for the average hand, unless your a child it fits perfectly, the charging dock is elegent in design, just set the brush on top and waa-lah charging. The charge indicator is simple. If it's dying, it blinks red. There is no need for an LCD there since I can't look down at it while brushing.My mouth feels cleaner, I'm mad at people for never turning me on to this earlier however better late than never.
B000050FDE If you're as unfortunate as I am and seem to have a talent for producing plaque you will find this Oral B to be a life saver!No more do I have to endure endless scrapings when I go in for my semi-annual dental check because the regular use of this product has greatly reduced the amount of plaque on my teeth.Thank you Oral B!
B000050FDE I've used an Oral B since 1993, and am on my 3rd one. The first one finally \"burned\" out a few years ago, and the 2nd one I somehow left in a motel room, and it conveniently got \"lost\" (hope the maid is enjoying it), as when I called that afternoon, \"nothing had been found\"...These cannot be beat. Like many other reviewers have said, the dentist's ALWAYS notice the difference when people switch to these.Personally, I always brush on high speed until it beeps, then I switch to low speed, and re-brush, and then go onto my gums and tongue before stopping.A Great Tool, from a Reliable Mfg., Not to be Beaten! If you've not used one of these, by all means, GO OUT AND GET YOURSELF ONE, NOW!! You'll NEVER regret it! ~operabruin
B000050FDE B000050FDE: Oral-B Professional Care 1000 Power Toothbrush  Am pleased as punch with this dental device, which puts others to shame.  In fact, the soniCare 1126 corpse that it replaced is patiently waiting for proper disposal.  I don't know if toothbrushes have chemicals in them which would pollute the environment if given half a chance.   I don't recall when the Philips soniCare was first used, but even at first brush, it never performed as well for me as the Oral-B.  Different strokes for different folks.   This Gold Box item leaves my mouth feeling super clean each time I use it, and I particularly like the double-head brushes.  Thank you, Amazon, for making this available to me at an \"irreteethable\" price.
B000050FDE I'm up and out early before the rest of the house and i would have preferred that this be a little quieter. I like the functionality and form, but the noise makes me reluctant to use it when others are sleeping. Likely just my perception, but it's enough to limit it's use for me.
B000050FDE This is my second electric toothbrush.  I upgraded this time based on a recommendation and have to say it lives up to it's description.  When fully charged - it will take you through an extra long vacation without re-charging. I like the smaller brush that allows you to get around bridge work and between teeth, and that it lets you know when you've done 2 minutes worth (started out determined to always do this --- think I'm down to a minute -- but teeth and gums look and feel good.) Only thing I'd like is a bigger head on the main brush, so that my minute was covering more teeth area.
B000050FDE My teeth have never been cleaner. From the first time I used it and licked my teeth to feel how clean they were, I was impressed. I have never done nearly as good a job with a manual brush. And if this model can deliver that level of performance, I don't see the need to spend triple digits on another kind.
B000050FDE I started using this toothbrush on the advice of my sister (thanks, Sis!) and also after reading some studies confirming that an electronic toothbrush that uses both rotary and in-out pulsating motion will improve gum health. My dentist did notice an improvement in tartar build up. He said that he notes when patients use this brush and that it seems to give good results.Plus Points1. This brush has both rotary in and in-out pulsation. This is the combination that is better than rotary-only and that studies show gives better results.2. The replacement heads have an indicator that shows wear (the bristles become white. When the decolorization on the bristles is down to about 1/8 inch, it's time to change the head.)3. There is a timer to let you know you have brushed 2 minutes (recommended brushing time.)4. It does feel like \"after the dentist cleaned\" if you go the whole 2 minutes.Minus Points1. If you don't recharge according to the manufacturer's recommendation initially, you will not have a long battery life.2. The manufacturer doesn't make this entirely clear, but you should run the charge DOWN on the brush, then recharge, for maximum life. If you don't do this, you could experience a short life-span on this toothbrush. This happened to someone I know; the company made good on the guarantee and sent a replacement.3. If you DO let the charge run down, the brush is not so vigorous at the end and it seems a bit wimpy to do a really good job near the tag-end of the battery charge.4. You should go the 2 minutes for effective use, but who likes to stand there, spitting foam and grimacing in the mirror for that length of time?5. You should use it gently or you can scratch your gums.6. The replacement heads are a bit expensive.Despite the minus points, I rate this toothbrush five stars because I love how my teeth feel and it makes flossing afterwards better because I seem to have less tartar buildup. I am considering a second one to keep in my bag at work. I hate to brush with anything else.Highly recommended
B000050FDE I spoke to oral b and found out that this brush is identical 100% to the oral b 7400. Which is more expensive. The only thing the oral b 7400 has is an extra brush. Its a no brainer to buy this one.
B000050FDE I charged it for 18 hours as it requested from the get go. Once I start it up, after about every 15-20 seconds, it hiccups for 1 second.  Not bad of a product.  Feels different since I use less toothpaste now (compared to brushing manually).  I feel like a lazy hygienist now, with the lack of desire to brush my own teeth because the feeling of \"Success!\" and \"Clean!\" isnt' there anymore.  However, I will use this product until it is dead. I also bought it discounted from the amazon gold box.If there were no hiccups, I'd give it a 4. that's the main defect (with mine at least).  I do like the waterproof-ness, but I don't need it since I don't brush in the shower.-MCUpdate: Upping to 4star
B000050FDE My dentist scolded me for thrashing my gums by brushing too hard and for having too much plaque. He insisted I get the Braun Oral-B, which he said was the best of its kind. I'm glad I did. The design has a soft mode for people with sensitive gums and it has cut down my plaque, far better than had I used a conventional toothbrush. Also the device is easy to use and maintain so I'm confident I'll use it consistently. Finally, I must say my teeth feel far more clean and smooth now. The Braun no doubt will have prevented me from getting some serious dental work.
B000050FDE I got this model for only $22 because CVS was clearing out the 1000 from their shelves for the arrival of the newer stock. My previous brush was the Oral B \"Cross Action\" AA battery powered brush. Until I used the 1000, I was satisfied with the Cross-Action. It was a good brush using a single battery and the brush heads were fairly good quality being Oral B.But now there's no going back. Honestly, I would not have purchased it - had it been selling at its former retail cost of over $80, but since my daughter is a manager at a local CVS, I was an early bird for the clearance - and sprang for the $22. So looking here at Amazon to see what others paid and what they think of this model prompted me to write my two cents worth in the form of a review.The motor is comparatively very quiet, yet obviously powerful. The cleaning result is superb, and noticeably improved over my former brush. The brush heads do seem tougher so far as the expected life and the dual action head is my personal fav.  My teeth feel noticeably smoother and gums more massaged. Tongue cleaning with the brush is very thorough as well. A good toothpaste will accent itself using this brush.Personally, I find the timer to be a slight nuisance more than a feature. I agree that over brushing - like applying too much pressure - is bad. But when I'm brushing, I don't like the nanosecond interruption of the motor frequency change - however-minor. But that's just me.Other reviewers commented about the battery, as if it's \"a negative\" feature. Admittedly, it would be better if it was Lithium-Ion, but then its cost would have been even higher.However, being a Ni-MH battery pack - it is an improvement over the older Ni-Cad type. It has more capacity and cannot be over-charged by the included charger. The owners manual is very clear to point this out and even instructs to discharge it fully every (6) months to maintain optimum power, duty cycle, and battery life. I don't think that is a negative, just the proper care for a device using this type of battery. Those interested could consult Wikipedia on NiMH batteries for a better scoop. Personally, I have not noted any degraded operation whatsoever in constantly charging mine all times when not being used, (and I doubt anyone else would either - for years).The only negative I see is the price for the replacement brush heads. Hopefully, being made more aware of the cautions stated against over-pressure and over-brushing will also yield longer brush head life. The pricing seems outrageous. The cost for the better brush heads OTC @CVS was $26 for a(3) pack. Amazon lists them for less, but they are as much or more after shipping is applied. So make 'em last long as you can as you enjoy this great quality toothbrush!
B000050FDE I owned an electric toothbrush briefly while I had braces a few years ago.  It was terrible.  I don't even know what brand it was but I think I gave it to Goodwill.  In the last year or so, my orthodontist and hygienist have told me to get another one.  I finally did January 1.  I wanted the Braun Oral-B 3D Excel Pulsating Toothbrush but got this one instead.  They seemed about the same.  I was apprehensive at first.  I let it charge for 16 hours (as the manual said) and used it the next day.  It's scary how much it vibrates. It seems like it would damage your teeth or gums! But it's so neat though! I hope it helps.  I have a problem with plaque and gum recession (I'm only 24!!!).  But when I had braces I brushed really hard not knowing the damage it would do to my gums.  Now I know, so I guess that's all that matters.  I feel some tartar on my teeth after using this thing but I think that is because I was worried I'd hurt something in there! As I get used to it, I'm sure it'll be much better.  I spent $63 on this, so it better work! Already, I like it better than regular brushing.
B000050FDE Do you have migraines or Meniere's disease or just have a sensitive head? Don't get any of the pulsating Oral B brushes. They will just make you nauseous or trigger a headache.I have used the classic Oral B electric brush for many years. A fantastic simple white design by Braun of Germany - since discontinued after Braun was bought by an American company. Now I have the simple low end non pulsing model. Essentially the same guts and head as the classic but with an ugly, over stylized, blue body.When the battery started to die on my classic model, I picked up a pulsating Oral B. It is really banging away at your teeth and does as good a job as the non pulsatinging. But it vibrates your jaw and skull like, well, a vibrating electric tooth brush! After a month, it was just too much for me. I went back to the dieing battery original, but soon got its replacement as a gift.The verdict: I'm in my 40s and I've had about 6 different dentists (moving from job to job) in 5 different states. One was a professor at a dental college. After each visit, they all proclaim my teeth are in excellent shape. I use the cheapest Oral B electric brush (non pulsating) in the morning and before bed with Colgate Total. I also floss just one time before bed and use the Crest rinse for night time. I get them cleaned every 6-9 months.Save your money and get the cheapest Oral B electric toothbrush. I think it is on sale sometimes for about $10.
B000050FDE When my old Braun Oral-B conked out after 7 years of twice-daily use, there was no question I would replace it with a new Braun.  I'm quite pleased with this model.  It seems that the brushing motion is smoother, quieter and faster than my old faithful, and my teeth feel like they've just had a cleaning at the dentist.  Braun always comes through.  Really couldn't be more impressed or happy with this product.
B000050FDE I have used this for more than two years and very happy. Highly recomend this .Oral-B Professional Care 1000 Power Toothbrush
B000050FDE It's been 8 months since I purchased this item. I've enjoyed Oral-B brushes for a long time and this one ranks right up there with the others I've tried. I like the battery indicator lights, which are great for traveling. The battery holds a charge for a very long time. There are a nice variety of brush heads that will work with this model as well. Good deal!
B000050FDE Compared to a regular tooth brush my teeth feel so much cleaner, and the vibration is enjoyable as well.The battery life is great, however it seems to take a while to fully charge. This is not a problem at all though because you don't need it to be fully charged to use it.The charger base is easy to clean even if dried up tooth paste begins to build up on it.As far as replacement heads, I went with theGeneric Oral-B Dual Clean Compatible Replacement Brush Heads (4 ct.). They work great and are cheaper than the Oral B brand replacements.Highly recommend this powered tooth brush.
B000050FDE I had the older version of this from a couple of years back, and that older one felt stronger - and is still going strong. I got this one for my husband, and I did not like it nearly as much. The water tends to splatter more than my old one, and the vibration is bigger but not deeper.For the price I paid, though, it was fine. I just can't justify giving it 5 stars when it doesn't add up to the quality of its previous versions.
B000050FDE I bought two of these during a Today's Deal and I am so glad I did.....these are really perfect.  The dual head does a fantastic job, the brush is much lighter than my other electric toothbrushes of the past, that have all been hiding under the sink.  Just a few days of brushing with this and you will notice a huge difference in your gums and your teeth.
B000050FDQ I bought this for my husband because he really liked the idea of a self-cleaning razor.  It worked okay for a month or so and then broke.  He sent it in for repair and it came back working properly.  A few months later, it broke again. Again it was fixed.  Props to customer service for this.Since we were already going broke paying for the cleaning solutions, when it broke a third time, we decided it wasn't worth the hassle and bought a different one.
B000050FDQ I bought this shaver about 10 years ago now, from a local store.I'm posting this review more as a testament to Braun's German made shavers, than necessarily as a review on this particular shaver, because you can't buy this model any longer.It's survived 10 years... of morning shaves... of being packed in luggage and thrown on airplanes or taken on trips in a car trunk.  Probably a drop or two.  It still feels SO solid in my hand, not cheap at all.  Shaves wonderfully; I replace the cutter/foil system about every 18-24 months.  Cleaning system still works great.  Every mechanism and button works just as good as new.In short, it's a beautifully engineered product.I will reiterate, this shaver was made in Germany, before Braun started shifting production to China.  Their higher end shavers are still made in Germany.  I have a little bit of experience with a Chinese Braun as well, and it has been OK too, but it's not 10 years old yet.  So YMMV.Hoping to get another 10 years out of it.  :)
B000050FDQ This is the most comfortable razor that I have ever used.  I have tried a variety of razors over the years.  Because of my prominent Adam's apple, it was very hard for me to find an electric shaver that felt comfortable.  The Panasonics and the Norelcos always irritated my neck area.  That was even after using them exclusively for several weeks.  Fortunately for me, I found this Braun.  I have been using this for two years.  So far, it has performed very well.  The Panasonic Wet/Dry gave a closer shave.  But it also irritated my skin the most.  The Norelco that I had before also shaved very close.  But I had a hard time shaving my neck area with it.  So, I finally gave the Braun Syncro a try.  After a while, I started getting the most comfortable shave ever from an electric.The shaver itself would get 5 stars.  However, the cleaning system that came with it is a bit expensive to maintain.  The cleaning cartridges that the cleaning system uses can get expensive.  I suggested to Braun that perhaps they should sell a reusable plastic cartridge, along with a liter (or 2) of the cleaning fluid in bulk bottle.  The consumer could simply empty the plastic cartridge and then refill with fluid.  That would save the consumer quite a lot.  The cleaning system does a good job of cleaning, lubricating, and recharging the razor.
B000050FDQ The Braun Synchro System line consists of several models: 7570, 7546, 7526, and 7505. The top of the line is, naturally, the 7570. I suggest you go to [...] to see the spec comparison, as this site does a good job of showing you the differences. In a nutshell, they ALL have the same motor and cut exactly the same. The differences are in the number of indicators (the 7570 has an LCD screen), some additional chrome trim, and the inclusion of the cleaning system (the 7505 comes without it).I chose the 7526. At the time I bought it, there was quite a price difference between the 7526 and the higher 7546 and 7570 models. The 7526 comes with the cleaning system, while the 7505 does not. Other than that, the 7526 simply has only one LED indicator to show the remaining charge, and no decorative chrome trim on the head. Quite frankly, I see no need to get the 7570 in order to see exactly how much charge I have left, how long the cleaning system has been running, or how many hours I've spent shaving! All models will show a flashing red light when the charge is low. At that point you have two shaves left. Simply plug it into the socket when you're done and in about an hour or two you are fully charged. How hard is that?Although I bought the 7526, the 7570 shaver is essentially the same unit, so this review will apply.Details on the shaver itself: The Synchro System has a new high speed motor, and I think it is the fastest one for a shaver under $200. I find I get a very close shave, when using traditional foil shaver techniques (see Epinions.com website). Also, a single charge seems adequate enough to operate the shaver for two weeks. The motor and battery are light weight, so this shaver is not heavy, and it fits nicely in your hand. Three usage settings are available: 1) pivoting head, 2) locked head, and 3) trimmer extension. I use all three at various times--once again, Braun thought this out very well. It is also fairly rugged, but the plastic can crack if dropped from 4' or more onto a hard tile surface.The cleaning system: I find this device very ingenious, for a variety of reasons. First, it really does clean the shaver well. Second, it isn't overbearingly loud. And third, it has indicators to show when cleaning and charging are done. The fourth is revenue. Braun was very clever about this. If men are only going to spend money once every two years on the foil and cutter block, how could they make more money? Well, this cleaning system is the key. If the cleaner is used the way Braun recommends, you end up replacing the cleaning cartridge every month. The smart thing to do is buy the \"value pack\", which brings the cost down to about $5 per cartridge. How do you know when to change it? Well, the cleaning system will tell you. It detects when there is a high amount of particles in the solution, or if the solution is too low to flow through, and will flash the red cartridge light while simply not running until you replace the cartridge. The cleaner unit itself is slightly big (about 12\" tall x 5\" round), so you may have a little difficulty finding a place for it. And don't think of bringing it with you when traveling! (You don't really need to clean everyday anyway).But, I found a trick that Braun will despise me for. You can minimize the use of the cleaning solution and save big $$$. How do you do this? Well first of all, after each shave I dump my \"whisker debris\" down the sink, like you would normally do with the Flex Integral. It doesn't take long--simply pop off the foil, tap it in the sink, blow on both sides of the cutter block, replace the foil, and you're done in 10 seconds. This reduces the number of particles in the cleaning solution. So, why use the cleaning system at all, you may ask? It does do an excellent job of cleaning the cutter block, and whisker dust that is stuck on it and within the head and foil holder. A tedious task, even once or twice a week. When do I use the cleaning system? Well, usually whenever the shaver needs to be recharged. At this point, I take out the cartridge from my drawer, remove the top plugs, and slide it into the cleaner. Then I slide in the shaver and let the cleaner do its work. When the cleaning and charging is done, I remove the cleaning cartridge, reseal it with the plastic plugs, and put it away. This way the solution level does not get low from evaporation! Clever, eh? The only catch is that if you try to charge the shaver while mounted in the cleaner without the cartridge, it will not work. But you can always plug it in directly, without the cleaner. Anyway, that's my trick for getting around one this somewhat minor drawback. Some have said it's nice to have a \"clean\" shaver to use each time, but I find the cleaning process works well enough to use once per charge (just dump the whisker debris after each shave).If price is no object, get the 7570. Otherwise, I recommend getting the 7526 if you find it priced low enough below the 7546 and 7570. NOTE: I paid $139 for my 7526 in 2000.
B000050FDQ I have used this shaver for nearly 8 months and I love it! This product was given to me as a gift to replace my old electric shaver that wasn't doing the job. Now, I can truly say that the Braun gives me the closest shave of any electric shaver I have used. Say goodbye to your blades!I have sensitive skin, but the Braun doesn't irritate like some electrics can. It is very quiet and easy to operate. It is comfortable to hold, too. Cleaning is a cinch....but with the automatic charge and cleaning system, you don't even have to agonize over getting the cutters super-clean. Just let the machine do the job for you every few weeks to get it good-as-new.This electric shaver is so good that I have trouble finding anything to criticize. One drawback is that the entire unit (cleaning/charging base) takes up quite a bit of counter space. But, that is a minor complaint for a product this exceptional. I would definitely buy this product again and will recommend it to anyone interested in a new electric shaver.
B000050FDQ There is a newer offering from braun which I also have. The 7526 razor has been around for several years now and is by far the best one ever made. I have had mine for well over 7 years now and it still works like a champ! I have had to replace the foil and blade twice and the replacements are for sale on amazon. I accidently plugged the cord into only one slot on a power strip and it ruined the power cord so I thought I would \"upgrade\" to the newest version. The newer razor did not shave as good as my trusty old one. So I purchased a power cord and I have since packed the new one away in the attic. I'll never give up this razor! It holds a great charge and I am still using the original battery.
B000050FDQ OK.I'd like to give a small background.  I was a long time blade-only user.  Gillette's Mach 3 Turbo gave me the absolute closest shave I'd ever gotten when combined with Gillette Edge shaving gel.  My biggest problem - the blades price.  $15 for 4 tiny lil blades?  WAYYY too overpriced.  I must have spent about $120 on blades alone.I'd tried the rotary type and other of the in-line type of electric shavers.  The rotary kept snagging my hairs, and the inline didn't cut at all.  So I was a little apprehensive about going back.I'm an African American whose facial hair grows rapidly.  I find I have to shave twice a day.  As a working man, I often don't have time (and am too lazy) for that.  So I picked this up at Rite-Aid (who has it for $30 cheaper than Amazon).My first impression was that it felt very well put together, and smelled very nice.I need to put this up for the African Americans out there, because in order for this shaver to earn its keep, there are some things you need to do first, or it will not work.First, you need the right electric pre-shave cream.  I use Williams &quot;Lectric&quot; Pre Shave cream.  It makes the hairs very easy to shave.Second, you MUST shave with a razor the very first time.  Especially if you're prone to razor bumps.  The blade is designed to help get rid of the bumps.  If there's bumps, the foil will not cut close at all.  After you do the first shave with a razor, then use this for maintenance, and I guarantee you that it will do its job.Third, DO NOT wash your face beforehand; wash it after.  if you wash your face beforehand, the hairs soften and get harder to cut.  Since we have curly facial hair, it will naturally aim for your face instead of straight out.Fourth, after shaving, wash your face with a good face wash, like Clearasil or something.  IT will clear off the dirt, oil, pre-shave, hairs, and everything else.Fifth, finish everything off with a good aftershave.Once you've done all of that, use the razor as a routine.  I use it twice a day, I clean it once every two days.  There's no need to use the cleaner EVERY day; that's how you run out of fluid fast.  In fact, I just use a compressed air can (keyboard cleaner) to clean between the blades.  Works just fine for me.I have about 5 more steps to my routine.  Here's what I do (to make sure my face is the ultimate snooth it can be):- preshave lotion- shave with electric shaver- wash with Clearasil Daily Face Wash- quick Stridex pad over shaved area (dries out any remaining oil)- all over astringent (I use Sea Breeze) until there's no dirt on the cotton ball- all over Clarifying Toner (makes sure my skin tone remains consistent, I use Clean &amp; Clear)- aftershave (I use Gillette)I know it's a lot, but my face looks strides better when I go the distance like that.  I could always half it and just do the minimum, but my face doesn't look anywhere near as good as when I do all of it.  Besides, it takes me all of 15 minutes.
B000050FDQ From my experience this shaver best serves its purpose as an \"I'm late for work and gotta shave quick\" shaver.  The shave closeness on my face is no doubt the best I've experienced with an electric shaver but the neck leaves much to be desired.  The cleaning ability is the strongest feature of the Synro.  Overall good shaver for occaisional use but not strong enough to replace the blade for every day use.
B000050FDQ I had been a Braun user years ago, but switched to a Norelco a few years ago because I felt the old Braun was too irritating. I never felt the Norelco shaved as closely, and maybe that's why it was less irritating. Be that as it may, I recently switched to the new generation of self-cleaning Brauns and I am absolutely thrilled!The shave I get now is almost as close as a blade, but because the self-cleaning mechanism also lubricates the blades, I am getting *none* of the irritation I used to get. In addition, the handy base not only contains the cleaning solution and performs the lubrication, it also handles battery maintenance by monitoring your usage pattern and adjusting the charging schedule accordingly, including periodic and fully automatic complete battery discharge & recharge, which will result in longer battery life and longer cordless cycles.About the only 2 things I don't care for are the very bright blue light on the base which is even a bit too bright as a bathroom nightlight (I'll get used to that, I'm sure) & the ever-present, light machine oil odor the cleaning solution imparts to the bathroom in general and to the razor in particular.By the way, the 7526 model is a good bit cheaper than the newer 7680, but lacks only its LCD display, which I find little use for personally.
B000050FDQ This is the third Braun shaver I've owned and it lives up to the reputation. It gives a great shave, and I love having a clean shaver after every use!
B000050FDT I've had three Braun razors and never had a foil tear on me until I bought this replacement set. It tore after about two weeks (Also, the plastic piece that retracts the Interface trimmer broke two weeks later). Since two other reviewers have had the same problem, I think it is possible that Braun got a bad batch of foils. I suggest you avoid the replacement set and just buy a new 3612 razor ($29 at Target).
B000050FDT I've used Braun razors for over 25 years, and while this model isn't as good as some of the older simpler models, it still works fine. It's great to be able to purchase screens and cutting blocks on Amazon as it's hard to find these in local drug stores. Thanks for providing such great service and just for being there Amazon!By the way, Braun has a great, simple little battery-powered travel shaver that I now use as my main shaver, and then I use my older model for the side trimmer. The little guy is only about $15 and does a great job, and even has its own rotating screen cover. Very neat.
B000050FDT This razor has been pretty crappy to me.  I got it as a Christmas gift about 1 1/2 years ago.  After about 1 year, the foil got a tear in it, so I paid $26 and got the replacement pack (turns out Braun doesn't sell just the foil anymore).  About 6 months after I bought the replcement, the foil got another tear in it.  Now it nicks me every time I use it.  It does a nice job, but it is crap for $30, spend a little extra and get a better razor.
B000050FDT The manufacturers of electric shavers appear to be taking pages out of the playbook used by makers of printers, which are often priced cheaper than the print cartridges themselves.  Once they've got you as a customer, they figure the red ink will soon be the customer's, not theirs.  Purchasing another screen (my 3rd or 4th in two years) for a shaver that cost me only 20% more than the flimsy foil itself strikes me as exhorbitant if not exploitive.  (The least Braun could do is make the foil available as a separate item rather than bundling it with the cutter assembly.)  I'd try a Norelco or Remington, but I think they're all manufactured in China for the same U.S. company (Gillette?).  I may bloody my face for a few more days before throwing in the towel--or trying a Panasonic.
B000050FDT This replacement system is easy to install and returns the razor to its original cutting capabilities.  Holes may wear in the old sheath making it pinch and grab.  This replacement system cures that quickly and easily.  An excellent product all around.
B000050FDU These replacement heads for a Braun shaver are effective and worth the money.  Supplier provided the heads right on time.  Have been using them in my electric razor and quickly noticed an improvement in the shave provided.  Would defintely buy they again and from this seller.
B000050FDU First I must say that I can't believe my Braun 5000 model rechargeable razor still charges after 15 years (yes, 15!). I have a light but full-face beard and I use my razor for daily maintenance only. When my foil started to show holes I replaced it with this kit that included the cutting blades as well. For 20 bucks I have a new shaver! Works like new and is quiet as new.
B000050FDU I have a Braun shaver that is 2 years old, and the foil head had some small breaks.  It slowly became less and less effective.  Just a few weeks ago, I purchased this replacement kit, and lo and behold....my shave now acts like it is new.  One or two passes gives me a close shave.The blade and foil head are very easy to replace - so do yourself a favor and buy this.
B000050FDU This foil/cutterblock appear to be factory produced and shave just like the original blades did. Be aware that when you find these blades on Amazon there is a line just a little ways down the page that says \"There is a newer version of this item\". That supposed \"newer version\" is cheaper but it is not factory and does not shave as well. I know because I bought it.
B000050FDU I've used many, many electric razors over the years, and like my relatively inexpensive (no such thing in the electric razor world) Braun.  These heads have always lasted a year or more, and I've had 4 or 5 so far (do the math and you'll see the quality of the razor itself).  And I'm about to buy one more set before I expect to finally retire and replace my shaver next year.
B000050FDU These replacement cutters are for Braun shavers. I have purchased many of them for a few different models of electric shaver over the years. I always find the replacements to be hit and miss sharp or dull. Braun needs to do some improvement on these blocks to get them all cutting evenly.
B000050FDU hubby had a braun 5770. I did a lot a reading and was not sure if this would be a good fit but it works great according to him.  The packaging was not the same as what is in the photo so I was a little worried but it works fine.
B000050FDX I have used Braun razors for years. I have never replaced the foil before. My foil began to wear out so that it had holes and the sharp edges would cut my face. I do not know if they are making the foils thinner. In any case, it was an easy fix.
B000050FDX The Braun 7000 series is a great razor.  This new replacement foil head seems to have a more random hole pattern and perhaps a larger open to covered ratio.  This results in a better shave for me especially on neck hair.  Good stuff.
B000050FDX I have been shaving with Braun electric shavers for 20 years or so. Loved most of them (especially an old, credit card sized one), but I particularly love my current 7000 series. Smooth, with no hair pulling and I never got any cuts, whether using it wet or dry. Buy one the first chance you get.
B000050FDX My shaver is 5 years old or older. Still these folks were able to get the replacement parts, Shaver is working great again.Thank you
B000050FDX This replacement pack used to work with Braun Series 7 (799CC model) and I've ordered it multiple times. I used this one because it was better than their other advertised replacement pack. Sometime in about the last year and a half, this part has changed (but the name of the item has stayed the same) and it no longer will fit the razor. So, not pleased with this of course...
B000050FDX What a great savings!  The in-store price at a local \"super\" store was $29.99--Amazon's price is $19.99.  Thanks for the great deal!!!
B000050FDX Ordered this replacement for my Braun shaver and I'm more than pleased with the results. Would buy this again when needed.
B000050FDX This is the replacement foil and cutter for the Braun Syncro line of men's electric razors.  Braun recommends that you replace the set about once per year.  I am a gentle user and can get slightly more usage out of mine.  Your foil and cutter may also last longer if you lubricate your razor with something like Remington's lubricant.  The Syncro's cleaning system will also lubricate the blades for you; however, the cost of replacement cleaning cartridges make that an expensive option.Basically, you do not want to wait until you have a hole in the foil to replace the set.  A hole in the foil can result in your face getting a cut from the oscillating blades beneath.  So please, change your foil and cutter set regularly.
B000050FDX Although the part numbers have changed over the years, this foil / blade combination fits my Braun shaver. I typically get two or three years of use out of these blades. This new set made the shaver feel like brand new again. I always store the shaver in the charger / cleaning base. The programed cleaning probably addes to the longevity of the blades.Changing the blades is super simple. Pry off the foil by the plastic base. Pull on the coiled cutter cartridge. Snap in the new cartridge, and snap the foil over that. Takes all of two minutes even when I haven't done this for a long time.Braun Clean & Renew Refills (3 Pack)
B000050FDX Blades seem to outlive the screens and foils (at least on the one I have). Therefore, it would be better if they included an extra set of those with the package. All in all, the product matches the description and performs as promised.
B000050FDX I read the reviews about how bad the 8000 Series cutters and foils were to I bought this one.  It works perfectly in my Braun 8585 shaver.  After two weeks and it's still working wonderfully.  Get this cutter and foil for your 8000 Series shaver.
B000050FDX These are genuine Braun replacement parts. I have been buying them for years from Amazon. The vendor is reliable and usually ships in a timely manner.
B000050FDX Changing the tires on the car certainly doesn't make a new car... but in the case of a new shaving head for this Braun shaver, it brings shaving back to the efficiency and speed that the shaver was when I first bought it 10 years ago.
B000050FDX I've had various Braun razors since I was in bootcamp almost 15 years ago and my company commander required my face to be cleanshaven at all times.  This meant I had to shave 4 times a day.  The toll that took on my face with even a good blade razor was awful, and I only survived by eventually switching over to a Braun rechargable that shaved almost as close as a blade but with far less damage.I've been a solid Braun customer ever since. Unfortunately, while consumer magazines tout electric razors as a money-saving tool, Gillette (the owner of the Braun brand for several years) has done a marvelous job migrating Braun customers to buy disposable replacement parts.  The cleaning system that comes with most new Brauns is a great way to get an annuity stream from customers who mistakenly thought they could buy a Braun and be done with spending money.While the value of the cleaning system replacements is sketchy, the 7000FC replacement combo isn't.  After anywhere between 6 and 12 months of use, the foil on a Braun typically gets one or two small holes.  These end up giving you nasty, painful small cuts.  The cutter too wears down a bit.  I notice when I replace both shaving my entire face takes probably 30% less time and is generally closer.  Well worth buying.One other note.  This product is a great reason to sign up for Amazon Prime.  Repeated free two day shipping on a product at a substantial discount to stores - I don't know how Amazon makes money on these transactions, but I'm glad they're letting us do them!
B000050FDX I should have done this long ago. I'll change them out every year from now on. It's like having a completely new razor. I think i have a 7050 or something like that. Replacement parts worked perfectly.
B000050FDX I have purchased these replacements for my 7526 twice now. once in 2005 and recently in Dec 2008. I have gotten the correct part each time. The reviews that state that this will not fit are old and it seems as if the problem has been resolved.I am glad I decided to go the rout of replacing the blade and foil instead of buying a new razor. the 7526 is the best razor that I have had. Those new razors are expensive so I plan on using this one until dies.
B000050FDX My husband has used electric shavers all his adult life. He says that this razor (Braun) is the best he's ever used. The cleaning and charging is simple and replacing this shield was also simple.
B000050FDX I bought my husband a Braun 7680 (BRAUN 7680 Syncro Pro Shaving System with Clean & Charge Base) in 2004 and he's now on his 3rd replacement combo. Along with theBraun Clean & Renew Refills (3 Pack), it keeps his razor like new. It's nice to get this at such an affordable price with convenient delivery.
B000050FDX I put a recurring reminder on my Google Calendar every 18 months to replace the cutter block and I am always glad I change it as I can tell the difference with the new blade and screen.  Results: A smoother, closer shave.The one I just got even seems to be a little more sturdy than the previous one, with the blades being slightly thicker, and the block more cushioned.
B000050FDX It was a bit touch and go to make sure I was ordering the correct replacement......but it was the right one for my husband's Braun shaver.  Made it just like new again.  Happy husband!
B000050FDX I gave this item a bad ratings because it is NOT the claimed model listed as being sold!  This is the newer (and by many opinions poorer) design with blades oriented horizontally under the foil.  I cannot find the older vertical style block for my 8000-series anymore, and saw a review for that line stating the 7000-series fit, and that most of the 7000 series were the old style.  Disappointed with Braun for changing the design without offering alternatives (an electric shaver is quite the investment), and the seller for not updating information- giving me false hope of getting the old style block/blades.  I'll keep and use these, but would have enjoyed seeing if the old kind cut better/last longer.
B000050FDX If you've got a Braun 7000 series shaver, you've got to replace the screen and blade, and this is what you need. It's best to change them at least once a year... look for the best price... When I found it on Amazon, it was the best price with free shipping and no tax... but check around on the web!
B000050FDX Nice performance difference when you replace these regulary. They are inexpensive and do a good job.
B000050FDX Easy to replace and these parts make my electric work so much better. Took me all of 5 minutes to pop the old ones out and replace them (just don't forget which ones are the old and new like i did) will keep my razor working for a long time and at a much cheaper price than buying a new one.
B000050FDX I searched and searched everywhere for a foil to fit my husband's Braun 7000 shaver.  I thought we'd have to chuck the razor at first until I went on Amazon and found exactly what we needed.  The product was delivered within two days and it fit perfectly.  I can't say enough about Amazon.  They are AWESOME!
B000050FDY Have been using these Braun Clean & Renew Refills for several years now.  They do a good job of helping to clean the razor (after you get rid of the hair debris).  Used to purchase them at various stores especially if I could find them on sale, which was almost never.  I have watched their prices continue to go up & up.  Then one day I found them on Amazon at their Subscribe & Save area at a cheaper price, especially because this package comes with 3 refills which is a money saver.  The only negative comment I will make is that once opened, each refill only last about 30 days -- sure wish Braun could figure out a way to make them last a little longer.
B000050FDY Have bought several of these and never had a problem.  Have used them in my old DOA Braun and my new Braun.
B000050FDY Not sure what I can say about this except that it works without any problems. What more can you ask for?
B000050FDY What's to review.  It is a box of four refills.  They weren't leaking so I guess that's about all there is to say.
B000050FDY I bought these to keep a supply on hand. They are identical to what I used to buy locally. Work the same, etc. just more convenient to have on hand and not have to wait for local store to restock.
B000050FDY Sure, you can run your shaver head under the faucet to clean out the whiskers.  The alcohol in these cartridges also disinfect your shaver foil and blades.  That's important since you are shaving so close with the Braun you are bound to get unnoticeable micro cuts that might harbor harmful bacteria.  The auto clean function works surprisingly well also.  I tested it by not shaving for three days and then shaved and stuck it on auto clean.  After the cycle was done, I pulled the head and inspected.  Spotless!  That is very impressive.  The Braun engineers deserve kudos for their innovations and making the world's best shaver.
B000050FDY This is a must for my husband Braun electric shaver. It fits into a special slot in the shaver holder and will clean the shaver when needed and does a good job cleaning the razer. It is very easy to remove and install a clean refill. Highly recommend.
B000050FDY I regularly order these Braun cartridges, as my husband has two razors that use them. These refills work perfectly and clean very well. The 4-count pack is so very convenient, and works great on Amazon auto-ship. Price is good - product is good. Highly recommended.
B000050FDY I use this with a Braun 8000 series activator (8585 I think). They are expensive (so is the shaver) but the system does work.  The first one lasted over 5 months, using it every 2 to 3 days on average.  No evaporation loss that I could tell.  You can add a small amount of alcohol to extend it but I am not sure that is within warrantee, etc.  I did shake the shaver blade out before using the cleaner, so that made it clean and fresh.  However, when I finished the cartridge there was a very fine screen on the intake side so it may not have been necessary.  One thing to note is that you cannot take this on a plane - even if you check luggage.I am sensitive to smells, but the lemon scent was not a problem even though I could smell it when the freshly cleaned razor was right under my nose.
B000050FDY Very easy to use cleaning solution. It contains alcohol and you don't have to worry about its installation, discard or amount used each time. There are indicators on the Braun cleaner itself telling you when it's low. Change once a month.
B000050FDY Braun kind of &#34;forces&#34; you to buy these refills.  They aren't excessively expensive, but can add up if you are using your shaver daily and clean it daily.  Subscribe and save is the only way to go.
B000050FDY Not much to say. Must have it. Does a great job. You can buy it in bulk (for a year at a time) and only costs like 3-5 bucks a month to own and operate. Go buy a stack of them.
B000050FDY Exactly as advertised. Basically the same cartridge that the unit came with, just the tags looked slightly different on the container. Still, works great and I plan on ordering more when the time comes!
B000050FDY As the razor uses these cleaners on an on going basis, try to stock up on the refills so I always have at least one on hand.
B000050FDY SIMPLE & RIGHT TO THE POINT. IT IS A MARRIAGE WELL MADE BETWEEN CLEANER & SHAVER.  WORKS AWESOME. SAVES ME TIME CLEANING THE SYSTEM.  DO NOT HESITATE, BUY IT.ANTHONY
B000050FDY This product works great with my 790cc shaver.  The price for these refills is a really good deal.  Recommend for yourself or for a gift for someone that has a Braun razor.
B000050FDY the braun clean and renew refill really work, my braun shaver works like a charm, I get a close shave and no irritation on my face
B000050FDY I am using refill number 2 of the 3 refills that came in the kit.I felt that refill #1 did not last long enough. I talk fromexperience as I have been using Brauns cleaning system for more than a year.Refill number 2 is lasting much longer.
B000050FDY Arrived quickly, packaged well, as described.Good price and actually easier then driving to walmart just to find out they are out of stock.Good Seller and Product - Highly Recommended!
B000050FDY I have had this razor for a good 6 yrs or more now. Replaced the blades and screen twice and this cartridge about every 6 weeks. ITs like a new razor every morning! The auto ship is great, a lot cheaper than I can get it locally. Even at the big W!
B000050FDY If you're a Braun user, then you know these.  What you MAY not know is that you can get these on &#34;subscribe and save&#34;.  Absolutely perfect timing from Amazon - about the time you're using the last one, the new box shows up.  DEFINITELY the way to go.
B000050FDY I would have to say the is the best price I have ever seen for these.  I would recommend buying a few of these at the same time to qualify for the free shipping.  This will enable you to keep the best price available.
B000050FDY I have been using my Braun shaver for a number of years.  I like the cleaning process very much.  My problem is that I have not been able to find these refills in any of the popular stores.  Finallly I did a search and found that good old, reliable Amazon carries these refills.  And what a surprise; a 3-pack.  Excellent product and fabulous Amazon.
B000050FDY These refills for the Braun Shaver make everything almost maintenance free.  Fantastic!  I would recommend these refills and the Braun Saver to everyone.
B000050FDY These are original quality replacements.  When I first received my system I would only use the self clean function occasionally because I wanted to be frugal with the cleaning solution.  The more I have experimented the more I agree with others that a lot of the fluid is lost due to evaporation whether you use it or not, so just use it.  I tap my shaver's screen daily to clean it and use this about once a week.  I get several months out of each refill that way.  If you're not going to run it at least weekly, then remove the cartridge and cap it between uses for cleaning.  Although at that point you have to ask yourself why you even bothered buying into the clean and renew system.
B000050FDY At first I thought that a self-cleaning razor was gimmicky, but after owning for several years now I think that this function is highly useful and that it keeps the expensive razor and blades in decent condition.  My one complaint about the refills is that because they are alcohol based product, it evaporates, so if you shave infrequently and therefore clean infrequently, the product does not last for very long.  The idea of removing the cartridge and capping is decent, but seems like more of an hassle than it's worth.
B000050FDY It took me a while to realize that one has to keep these closed when not in use (a few days between cleaning) otherwise it evaporates. Naively, I assumed that whoever designed the cleaner for my braun shaver thought of it already. But they did not.OK, that part can be dealt with - just keep your original cover, and put it back on every time after use.But what surprised me the most was that my cleaner says that the refill is empty when it is not. It is more then half full.Now I am motivated to figure out how to refill these on my own with 99% pure alcohol...
B000050FDY First of all, I shave every day, and I use these refill packs to clean my razor every day.  It was about two months before my cleaning/charging stand told me that I needed to replace the solution.  Now I had thought of about a dozen ways that I could save money on these cartridges including resealing them between uses and/or just refilling old cartridges.  However, after two months of use, I pulled my old cartridge out to find that it really did clean the dang razor in between uses.  The leftover solution was brown and had obviously been used even though it still smelled good.  I tried rinsing it out to no avail, so I just tossed it out and put in a new cartridge.Now I think that's certainly telling us something.  These bad boys work.  I bought a self-cleaning razor simply because I hate cleaning them, and I think that this one really fits the bill.  When I bought my razor, I did the math to determine that even a high end Braun electric would be, in the long run, more cost effective than using a blade.  That was based on using one of these cleaning solutions every month.  I'm quite happy that I can get by for two months on one before the stand tells me to change it out, and like I stated, I shave every day.
B000050FDY these do a great job at keeping your razor clean, but they are kind of expensive. I've read many places you can just use alcohol instead and refill them.
B000050FDY This refill makes it easy for you to clean your razor and keep it working perfectly.
B000050FDY These work with both my Braun's.  I have an older one and decided I would buy a new model instead of replacing the heads.  The first one was not their top of the line, the second unit I decided to go all out as the first one had been great.  I know it is these cleaner kits that go into the base station for both that make a huge difference.  When I was traveling 200+ days a year and I'd get home (and the device would be begging for an intense cleaning) the cleaning made the device like new.  Just a great system...not on the cheap side as it is an added disposable cost, but it makes a big difference on the effectiveness of the shaver.  If you have a unit that takes these it is worth keeping them fresh and ready to go to get the real benefit out of your wonderful shaver.  if not, get one with your next shaver...it's worth it!
B000050FDY I've been a user of Braun electric shavers for over 5 years. I recently upgraded to a new model and I have been noticing that the Clean & Renew cartridges have a shorter life span, from about 3 months to less than 2 months, not sure if it has to do with the new shaver using more cleaning product or that Braun changed the formula and it now has a higher evaporation point. I keep monitoring and researching around to see if I'm the only one, but so far I give it only 3 stars because of thisBut the Frustrarion Free Pack is great, it greatly reduces the amount of useless cardboard and excess material. Good job there!
B000050FDY Does the job. Can't complain and it is so nice to have them show up at my door. I do wonder how good of a clean my razor gets at the end of one of these canisters but there really isn't an alternative.
B000050FDY These worked great for my 790cc shaver. I don't use the alcohol cleaning function much. I wash thoroughly with water after every use, and do an economic clean once or maybe twice a week. One of these end up lasting me 3-4 months easy; I didn't have any evaporation issues like other people have mentioned, not sure why that is. Amazon \"subscribe and save\" is a great way to save money on this product, since it does seem rather pricey for just some alcohol mixture. They're probably refillable if you can figure out how not to make a mess out of it; although I'd sooner dish out the 10$ a year for these in convenience.
B000050FDY Works as expected. This is a continual purchase. Glad I have prime so I don't have to wait for delivery when I run out
B000050FDY These keep my razor clean for each use. Each one lasts about a month. Amazon.com is the best place to buy these. Good price. If you sign up for recurring shipments, you can save EVEN MORE! ...and I know I will continue to need them as long as I have this razor.
B000050FDY These are necessary for cleaning my razor and it is much cheaper getting them here than getting them at the store.
B000050FDY This is the replacement cleaning cartridge for Braun's line of automatic cleaning stand for their electric razors.  This cartridge will fit even the early model Syncros, all the way to the latest Pulsonics.I have not tried any of the newer Braun models, as my 7-year-old Syncro is still going strong.  However, be assured that they all use the same cleaning cartridge, even though the newer models have an improved cleaning stand.The cleaning system works great.  It cleans, dries, and lubricates the razor.  However, bear in mind that the cleaner is alcohol-based.  Meaning it will eventually evaporate.  It starts to evaporate as soon as you open the seal.  Each cartridge will last approximately one month.  So your cost to keep your razor clean and lubricated, automatically, works out to about five dollars every month.  That's not so bad, considering that shaving with a blade will cost you money in hot water use, shaving cream, and replacement blades.  I would say that perhaps the electric razor might come out cheaper.  You can be like me and simply clean your razor manually.  That's even more cost-effective.  But still, it is nice to be able to simply use your razor, place it in the cleaning stand, and then have it ready for you the next day, with no effort on your part.If you have a Braun cleaning system and you want to use it, this is your only option.  So it really doesn't make a difference whether I recommend it or not (I do).  As should be the case, you've chosen your system based on the quality of shave it gives you.
B000050FDY These refills fit my cleaner perfectly. Be careful when pulling the snap as this can sometimes cause spillage.  Disposal is extremely easy.
B000050FDY Great price and convenient!  I have also recently started reusing/refilling these items (note that the manufacturer says 'not to'). After the cartridge is out I clean it out by running water through it to empty inside contents. Then I refill with isopropyl alcohol+ 10 ml of glycerin. It works like a charm and costs about 25cents versus $3-5 each refill!
B000050FDY It's the same cartridge that came with the razor - no frills packaging.  I tried using just alcohol, but the filter at the bottom that strains your hair does clog, and is never the same after you try to clean it.  This is the best bang for the buck that I have found thus far.
B000050FDY Did not come in a box also states that it's Lemonfresh.It's not.Will not be buying it again.You have a pictures of something you are selling then you send something different to the buyer in my book.You are not telling the truth.
B000050FDY I've been using the Braun cartridges for years with no complaints. The new packaging from Amazon is a nice improvement - the four cartridges are packed in a single box that is shipped as-is. Less cardboard waste than the old packaging, and a better price per cartridge.To make the cartridges last longer, re-use the plastic tab that covers the openings to keep the cartridge sealed when not in use. I run my series 7 through a cleaning cycle about once a week or so, and can get months of use out of a cartridge as long as it's kept capped to prevent evaporation.
B000050FDY I got these Clean and Renew refills for my Braun shaver.  They work.  What more can I say?  This was the best price I could find at the time of purchase, but I recommend you shop around, including locally.  Prices for this item vary greatly between retailers.
B000050FDY Not much to say about this cleaner really. It smells great and cleans my razor.The problem I really have is that it evaporates fast . But its because of the cleaner not the solution..
B000050FDY The 3-pack cleaning cartridges have a good price.  It seems like the shipping cost is unreasonable but when you consider the cost of gas to travel for the product it probably comes out in the wash.
B000050FDY The clean and renew system works very well, at least for the shaver part of the razor.  It does not remove longer hairs from the trimmer.  It does seem to keep the blades sharper for a longer period of time, and to improve the \"feel\" of the shave.  Each refill appears to last about a month, and the system seems to sense the total time the shaver is used and adjust the length of the cleaning.  About once a week the system does a \"heavy\" cleaning.  The system obviously has a \"cost\" associated with the refills, 
B000050FDY A great product.  I have used for years.  Always cleans my Braun Razor in great shape.Keeps it clean, Fresh and working great!
B000050FDY These cartridges are somewhat pricey. This fluid keeps my Braun razor working perfectly. I think it is now about five years old, and works as well as it did the first day. The razor was expensive at the time, so slightly expensive cleaning cartridges are to be expected. Given the grunge that's in the bottom of these cartridges at the end of their life, I'd never try to replace the fluid myself. I think the whole idea of saving a few pennies on an expensive shaver like this is a false economy.
B000050FDY These work great in my husbands shaver cleaner. Keeps his shaver head clean, you can actually see all it cleans off when you remove the old refill
B000050FDY This product is used to clean and lubricate your Braun electric razors. They are reasonably priced and last a good amount of time. They have a lemon-alcohol kind of scent to them which I have grown to really like. These really work too. Sometimes when I don't get a chance to order extras and don't clean my razor for a few days I can really feel the difference. Shaving is much more painful because the razor starts to pull your hair more instead of clipping it.Don't get too complacent through. I would still recommend occasionally taking a brush and air can to the razor to get it extra clean.
B000050FDY Braun's cleaning system is efficient and effective and saves you from manually cleaning your shaver every day. You just have to decide if it's worth paying about $5 per month to have your shaver cleaned automatically for you. For me, it is. I take a tiny bit of pleasure every day in clicking the \"on\" button after shaving and walking away, knowing the shaver will be clean and ready to go when I need it. When I travel, I don't bring the cleaning unit, so I use a brush to manually clean the shaver every day, which (a) takes a few minutes, and (b) isn't as effective as the cleaning unit. So it's four stars, withholding one star just for the price.
B000050FDY Got these refills for my shaver. They may be a bit pricey due to some peoples outlook on it, however I see them as well priced and buy them in a 4 pack which easily lasts a years time. I do suggest taking the pack out and capping it then only charging every few uses rather than every use. This will make it last longer and fight evaporation.
B000050FDY they are expensive but it is what it is. If you want to save money take it out after each clean and put the lid back on so it dont evaporate.
B000050FDY It's \"Buyer Beware!\" time at Amazon.com. I bought a Braun electric razor from Amazon, and figured that buying cleaner cartridge refills at the same time would by a smart idea. Unfortunately, I clicked on the item from another vendor, \"Presents4You\", instead of Amazon.com. Did the \"One-Click Ordering\" thing, and when reviewing my order, noted that the cleaner would be shipped separately from the razor. \"Hmmmm\", I said, that wasn't very economical. Then came the big surprise. The cost of the cleaner was approx. $19. The cost of shipping and handling was $23 bucks! Yep, the dirty rats had emplaced an electronic pickpocket. I discovered that my only recourse for cancelling this attempt at online thievery was to send an email to the vendor, which I did within seconds of seeing this blatant scam. No response, but also no notice that the stuff was being shipped, so I figured that all was good. I also had ordered a supply of cleaner through Amazon.com...less than half the price, and it was shipped with my razor.  A week after my razor and cleaner arrived, I received a small package via UPS. To my disgust, it contained the unwanted cleaner cartridges...and of course, there was no invoice or return instructions. When my credit card statement showed up the following week, there was the charge for $43. I've attempted to file a claim through Amazon.com, but unlike the rest of their processes, which are user friendly and reliable, this particular process is difficult, and keeps getting rejected for \"technical problems.\"The lesson for those of you who read this pitiful tale of woe? Be VERY careful when selecting accessories for your Braun 360 series razor! (By the way, the razor isn't as great as it was cracked up to be, but at least I paid a fair price for it!)
B000050FDY I switched back to Braun recently, and found that these were much easier to replace than my old Panasonic.  The braun shaver is also a lot easier to use.  I had no problem at all with the packaging since it was frustration free and loading it into the base worked as expected.
B000050FDY This product is a must with the Braun Series 8000 Shaver (and other models).I use it all the time.
B000050FDY I like to keep my razor clean and go through these quite often. They leave the razor so fresh and so clean.
B000050FDY My husband loves this product. Keeps the razor clean, fresh and helps give a wonderful clean shave every time. Easy to use and Amazon has the best price on this that we have found.
B000050FDY These clean and renew refills are needed if you have a Braun shaver with clean and renew system.  Pricey but do work well to keep the shaver clean and smelling refreshed.  Buy them here and save over the local retailer.
B000050FDY This is designed for a specific Braun shaver/cleaner system and is convenient and works very well; simply insert and use.  I find when it reads \"low\" I just add some isopropyl alcohol and it lasts longer. This is a very good value for 3, but is still $5+ each. Though this little box arrived packaged very poorly in a large, smashed, under-protected box, the 5 stars is for the quality product, convenience, and ease of use. Very easy to insert, use, and cleans and lubricates a really nice shaver. I am a long time Norelco fan yet I prefer my Braun shaver and cleaning system to my Norelco XL.
B000050FDY Good Price as I shopped around for cheapest way to get these refills with shipping...cannot find it cheaper anywhere, and this includes going shopping at stores.  When making purchase DEFINITELY get the three-pack at minimum..and getting several is the way to go.  In fact I have seen on Amazon a single refill for the same price as THREE... DUH!?
B000050FDY People whine about cleaning cartridges for Braun razors but they really enhance the shave and are pretty cheap when you consider that you only buy one blade cassette a year.  Buying a six pack is way cheaper.
B000050FDY Much easier (and much less costly) to just remove the top of the shaver and tap it slightly to empty the whiskers. Rinse under faucet if desired. Shaver does not always charge when sitting on the device. Have to remove it from the stand and hook it up to the charge cord. This is an idea whose time has not arrived. Went back to my Panasonic ES8003 which takes up far less space, is easier to clean and gives a better shave.
B000050FDY Not really much to say. They do a good job of cleaning your electric razor and give it a fresh, sterile smell. No issues with it.
B000050FDY Product seems to be an exact replacement for my shaver. Definitely improved performance as compared to what I had been using as it was quite dirty and need to be replaced.
B000050FDY First of three must have had a defect.  It leaked all over and wasted 2/3 of the solution.  Second one seems to be working well.
B000050FDY I absolutely love these cleaners.  I had some older razors that didn't have the built in cleaning like the Braun does and there is a huge difference to their performance over even a short period of time.  The 4 pack I got was at a good price and I will definitely get more when they run out.  Currently the 1st of the pack has lasted a couple of months with a cleaning every week and the indicator only just changed from full to halfway on the solution.
B000050FDY I bought the Braun shaver and those were recommended with it so I got them but it turns out that they are for self cleaning shavers only.
B000050FDY I LOVE THE SELF CLEANING FEATURE TO MY BRAUN ELECTRIC RAZOR AND WITH THESE REPLACEMENT CARTRIDGES IT JUST MAKES IT THAT MUCH EASIER.
B000050FDY My oldest son used my old Braun shaver since I upgraded.  He loves it and this cleaning system allows for all the blades to be cleaned and ready to go again and again.  Note my son only shaves once a week, he is only 15....
B000050FDY I received a Braun shaver for Xmas last year and looked around for refills to keep the shaver clean.  We even thought of refilling ourselves but after the first try, this was not the ideal solution to using the refills.  We found these at Walmart for a good price but then when those refills were almost gone, I searched for a better price.  The Amazon automatic supply system for refilling these ended up being the best price anywhere and, with free shipping and scheduled shipments, this is one less thing we have to concern ourselves with.  Great product -- excellent value.
B000050FDY My husband is the one that likes this. I buy ahead and he never runs out! I bought 4 this last time and they were packaged great.
B000050FDY The convenience of not having to search for these cleaning refills coupled with a very competitive price make for a slam dunk when you consider it delivered to your door.
B000050FDY I buy these and often. I always clean my braun grazer and this is a must have. I don't want itchy face because I didn't keep my razor clean.
B000050FDY I have been very pleased with my Braun shaver but not with the expense of the refills that are used with the cleaning and recharging station. Have tried several of the alternatives that I have googled, but none are as effective as the Braun refills. Came across the 3 pack on amazon.com at a price that made the need to try and jerry rig something that wasn't as effective as the original unpractical.  Great price and a true value thanks!
B000050FDY This is a pretty straightforward item. Although it doesn't last quite as long as it should (with the price I paid for my shaver), the product itself and ease of installation is excellent.
B000050FDY I have been using this now for about 7 years and it is great.  First it keeps the razor clean and lubricated, so it never gets that bogged down feel or sound, second it has a nice fresh scent not the old stale cut hair smell that electric razors tend to pick up after periods of use.  It is my perception, I don't know if it is an actual fact that my blades tend to last longer before I need to replace them.  I love these cartridges, mine also last longer than the product description often not having to change them but every 2-3 months.
B000050FDY Decent product, a little expensive, the alcohol liquid does evaporate so one has to replace these on a regular basis. But a decent product for the price.
B000050FDY I've had my Braun self-clean shaver for years. These cartridges last a month (each) and with Subscribe & Save I don't even have to remember to order them.
B000050FDY Easy to install and replace.  Seems to last only so long.  Requires replacing a lot more often than I expected.Guess I'm just used to manually removing the hairs instead of some fancy auto cleaning system.  I tried to do that but it wasn't coming apart for me so its a requirement with this electric shaver.A lot of hair builds up in the bottom and because really dirt once used up.  So it works as advertised.
B000050FDY I'm rating this 5 stars because it works great. I'm like many people that try to use their Braun cleaner fiuld for too long. I've added water and rubbing alochol, but it just doesn't feel as good when cleaned. I stocked up on these from Amazon to always have freash cleaning fluid in the house. I don't pay sales tax and shipping is FREE when purchasing items over $25 combined. If you want to keep your Braun razor in great shape and get a clean, smooth and fresh shave, get this and change timely.
B000050FDY Only for Braun electric razors- lasts about a month (in my case anyway - several years \"observation too.) The \"unit\" lets you know (wait for the RED light!) when to do it too.
B000050FDY This product has been around for years, and works with the Braun auto-clean razors. They leave the razor clean, fresh smelling, and ready to use. I do wish they would last longer and that there were some way to recycle them.
B000050FDY It does what it's supposed to do - clean and sanitize my Braun razor.  One refill seems to last 2 months.  And that's shaving about 6 days a week.  I don't really know how it works, but it does.
B000050FDY Every few years, I break down and buy some of these.  I have 2 homes and 2 Braun units that use them.  In between, the denatured alcohol in them evaporates (in Colorado, EVERYTHING evaporates quickly), so I simply fill them back up.  When the stuff gets dirty, I empty it, rinse the cartridge and then refill it.
B000050FDY I use up maybe one of these every 6-8 weeks, so ordering with the automatic repeat and 15% discount is a no-brainer, and much cheaper than buying locally :)
B000050FDY It evaporates quickly and seems complicated when an alternate procedure is also mentioned in the razor's instructions.  Run the shaving head under tap water and ocassionally put a few drops of oil on the cutting foils.
B000050FDY He hasn't had to use these yet but said they're a great idea. He's very happy with them. It's easier to have these on hand instead of waiting when to order them when they need it.
B000050FDY Good and pretty and nice with price.It's worth to buy and I recommend it.Thanks and buy it for yourself.
B000050FDY I would have given this product 5 stars but I have to admit they are quite expensive especially since I replace them every 1.5 months. That being said, the cleaner works seemlessly with my shaver. It provides a fresh and clean shave every morning.
B000050FDY This is one of my favorite things about the Braun series 7. Those drain quite fast if you don't close the lid on the top, so DO NOT THROW IT AWAY! If you close the lid often, this should last you around a month or so, since the alcohol doesn't evaporate!
B000050FDY Now that Amazon has lowered the price to less than $4 each, this is a very good deal.  Better than you can get at Target, Walmart, etc.I think these refills make the Braun Syncro shaving system the best out there.  Nothing like a fresh, lemony, sanitary shave every morning.  I have noticed an improvement in my complexion since going to this system.So far my refills have been lasting 5-6 weeks each, which helps to increase the value and lower the cost.
B000050FDY I purchased this through subscribe and save for use with my Braun 790 system. I am very happy with the shaver, but I really like how it automatically cleans and smells fresh every time I use it. This item does ship slower than other subscribe and save items because the contents are flammable, which is understandable. They must ship it by ground shipping, so just keep that in mind.
B000050FDY this cleans your shaver very nicely does the job well I recommend it great value for the price of 4 pack
B000050FDY Great product, easy to install and is cheap.  No need for me to try to combine a cocktail of fluids to get the same results, nor do i need to settle for the imitations they sell online.  Buy this item, you can't go wrong.
B000050FDY This product keep my braun clean and ready to go!  Easy to use and mess free! So go ahead and try it!
B000050FDY If you have a Braun razor, this is the only product you can use in the cleaner/recharger.  It's somewhat overpriced.
B000050FDY This is the same you will get in the store. Only a better price and you don't have to deal with going to the store. Win win
B000050FDY The price is good and it is very convenient not to have search all over some store to find them when needed.
B000050FDY I have started ordering the Braun Clean & Renew Cartridge Refills through Amazon since it is easier and cheaper than buying at most drugstores. This package comes with 4 of the cartridge refills so you want have to worry about running low.
B000050FDY These products help maintain your razor running at peak level.  You will notice a closer and better shave using this product.
B000050FDY Product works as I expected, and the price for four of these is way better than you can get in the supermarket.
B000050FDY it's pricey but what options do you really have? my razor always seems clean and it smells fresh, so boom.
B000050FDY Have had a Braun for many years now and would typically buy the 2 pack boxes at the local store.  Found these on-line and couldn't be happier.  Having a bunch of extras is perfect for that time when your cleaner light turns red and you need that thing cleaned for tomorrow...
B000050FDY Braun cleaning cartridges work great and as well as the ones that came with my shaver. They are much cheaper than the ones at local stores.
B000050FDY I have been using this product for close to a year now with my Braun electric razor.  The product works very well in cleaning and refreshing my razor.  I use it after every shave.  It has helped keep my razor sharp and non greasy. I like the fact it isn't loaded with a bunch of toxic ingredients yet it gets the facial hair and grease out perfectly.  The product lasts over 30 days for me. It also has a pleasant fragrance so when you use your razor again it has a nice fresh clean and not overbearing fragrance to it. This product will help my razor last a very long time. The price was good. The product arrived two days before estimated delivery date in perfect condition. It was packed in a Braun package so they ust have just grabbed it off the shelf and sealed and shipped it. All in all the price was good.  I love the subscription option.  It saves you a nice amount of change over time.
B000050FDY Great concept, though a little pricey. Necessary evil if you have a Braun razor using the clean and renew system.
B000050FDY You can't beat these, they work well and clean your razor for you.  I enjoy the citrus scent it leaves behind, or at least I think it is citrus.  They are a bit on the pricey side, but what are you going to do.  The razor offers to great a shave to ditch it because the cost of a cleaning cartridgeA good secret to make this thing last long is buy a cheap bottle of alcohol at a pharmacy, cvs sells it for a dollar.  If you want buy some witch hazel as well, its about the same cost.  Pour the alcohol in the cartridge and if you want add a touch of witch hazel for the smell.  It works great, I do it all the time and have owned the same razor for 4 years.  Its saves me a ton money especially during the summer months when the solvent pretty much just evaporates at 4 times the speed.  Just keep an eye on the hair build in the cartrigde, you can work a cartridge for 3 times its normal life.  More if you empty the hair out before cleaning it.
B000050FDY I buy these on Amazon because they cost less than they do at any of the large local stores.  I shave every other day and set the razor to clean after every shave and I find these last quite a while, long enought that I can not reall the last time I put one in, it must have been about two months ago, it is showing the low level light now.  Given this usage I think I go through about three packs a year, not bad to have a nice shave when I want and keep the blad running smooth.
B000050FDY Those of us who shave have to \"face\" it.... shavers and razors all have repeated costs.  A normal razor requires new blades, shaving cream, and after-shave (sometimes pre-shave).  People have gotten used to the idea that electric shavers should have fewer consumables (especially given the cost).  However, electric shavers have greatly improved in recent years, and the new Brauns are about the greatest shavers on the market today.  Part of the way they achieve such a close cut is that they do not \"gunk up\" with skin cells and oil the way other shavers do.  I guess you could clean another shaver daily, but the Clean and Renew is about the best way I have seen to maintain a consistently close shave.  I accept the monthly cost of these cartridges the way one would buy shaving cream, shampoo, or any other toiletry.  They do a nice job and smell quite pleasant.  Only issue is that the smell is not designed to go right on your face.  If you remove the shaver mid-cycle and try to use it, it is not a pleasant experience.  But one the liquid dries, the shaver has a pleasant aroma.  Recommended!
B000050FDY The cartridges work perfectly and having four gives me a reserve supply - I never remember to reorder until one runs dry.  But the cover flaps are difficult to open and I generally splash some on the sink.I am very happy with the job that the cartridges do.
B000050FDY I've used Braun shavers for donkey's years ever since I got one for Christmas years ago. I won't ever go back to a blade even if it does shave more closely, I just can't stand to think that I'm just a sneeze away from a free face peel.Before Braun came up with this cash cow I was cleaning my Braun with a toothbrush every 2-3 shaves. I still do that about once a month because even though the fluid cleans the cutting blade you still get hair detritus left behind in cracks, outside of the foil assembly and even around the two screws under the cutting block and other places. So once in a while, I'll get out my trusty toothbrush again and give the whole shaver a thorough cleaning over.This fluid is not cheap so I try to prolong the life span of it by \"pre-cleaning\" my shaver. I always open up the shaver and tap away the loose hair cuttings after every shave. This way, the cleaner fluid stays cleaner longer. And everyone is right, I don't think there's any way of preventing the fluid from evaporating, LOL, I think Braun made sure of that. Just make sure you don't park your cleaner in a hot area.Taking the advice of some the other reviewers, when I'm done with the cleaning, I remove the cleaning fluid and cap it to prevent further evaporation. The instructions say the fluid should normally last 1 month. By removing the cleaning fluid and capping it, I'm able to have it last 6 weeks even with cleaning the shaver after every use. But I would not recommend using it longer than that because dead bacteria and other things I'd rather not think about is going to remain in the cleaner fluid reservoir, and the cleaner fluid gets more concentrated and dirty. As another reviewer says, it's about $5 per month, which is not bad to have your shaver smelling good and clean. And it's certainly good for Braun!
B000050FDY I think I have my subscribe and save set to 6 months which is perfect. It seems once I load the last cartridge I'm getting an email from amazon telling me the next set is on its way. Its cheaper this way and less hastle.As for the product, its exactly what you need if you have a Clean and Renew razor. There really is nothing else to say about that.
B000050FDY These are a great thing for cleaning my shaver but now my electric shaver is not working, so now I got 2 more of these unit's I can't use, but that's the way I had to buy, in packs of three, so now the two other unit's are just sitting in my wall cabinate...
B000050FDY I have this razor, and love it and the cleaning system. But does Amazon take us for fools? They are selling this three-pack for more per unit ($4.33 per) than the two-pack ($3.99 per). Hopefully they'll lower this price instead of raising the other one...
B000050FDY I've our jaded replacement cartridges before and they were usually from my local RiteAid and it was 2 in a box of replacements for like $25 so this was totally worth the money and I got more cartridges!
B000050FDY I like a clean shaver, but this is an expensive and environmentally irresponsible way to accomplish the task.  The cartridges should be refillable, with minimal additional plastic.
B000050FDY They are required for the Braun shaver.  I didn't realize this when I purchased the shaver for my husband as a Christmas gift.
B000050FDY I used Braun razors for years. I used to think they were the best, but I got tired of their shoddy cleaning bases and pricey solutions. I've since switched to the Norelco 3d and that razor is no joke. Best save ever, by a mile. And their cleaning solution is easier to find locally than Braun's and costs less too.
B000050FDY I like the fact that this item comes in bulk, saves me some $$$Keeps hubby's shaver clean, so I don't have to clean it!
B000050FDY My husband loves this razor.  He bought the first refills for it from Rite Aid for $7 and change each plus tax, without asking me to shop around for him (sigh).  Amazon runs them three for $12.99 including super saver shipping.  I looked around and can't find them any cheaper than this.  If someone else can, I wish they would let me know.
B000050FDY Getting these in the mail for this price was so much better than running around in Wal Mart trying to get someone to open the case and get one out for me.
B000050FDY Great product for keeping the shaver clean! It's easy to use and i do recommend using it. I'm glad its easy to buy on Amazon.
B000050FDY I bought these for my friend, who needed refills for his Braun shaver system...I told him that he'd be better off getting them through me because I can get it in 2 days with my Prime Membership--and they'd be cheaper than the drugstore prices.I was right about the drugstore price comparison.However--when they didn't show up in 2 days, I called Amazon.  It turns out that the shippers require that these be sent regular-speed (something about Hazardous Materials), so it took 10 days to get here.  You cannot order these with the 2 day shipping.As far as the quality--they are the refills that are designed for the unit, and work just perfectly as expected.The Braun Shaver Systems rule :)  According to my friend, at least ;)
B000050FDY This is the only way to purchase the Braun Clean & Renew Cartridge Refills and save money at the same time. Check it out!
B000050FDY This fluid allows a braun self cleaning razor to stay both clean and lubricated so your shave is great until the blade goes dull.
B000050FDY My husband has had his Braun razor for about three years, and I have been ordering these cartridges for him that entire time.  He usually runs the cleaning cycle after every use and shaves about five times a week, but these still last a really long time for him.The new frustration-free packaging is also nice and helps cuts down on waste.Yes, these are pricey, but they do an excellent job of keeping his shaver clean and fuzz-free.
B000050FDY The liquid cleaner in these cartridges keep the Braun shaver in great shape.  My husband has had shaver for several years now and can attribute longevity to Braun Clean.
B000050FDY I love purchasing these little packets to keep my Braun Contour shaver clean and maintenance-free. I replace the refill packet every two months or so.
B000050FDY The good news is that since these cleaning refill cartridges are made by the manufacturer, they are an exact fit, and they work just the way the original cartridge does.  However, there are a couple of things to think about:Braun's manual says to run the cleaning cycle every day.  In reality, cleaning it every other day works just as well; I can't detect any difference between every-day and every-other-day cleaning.  As one reviewer notes, the cleaning liquid evaporates whether or not you run the cycle, but the simple fact is that the cartridge will run out sooner if you run the cleaning cycle every day.You could just clean the Braun with the little cleaning brush.  But what's the point of buying a shaver with an automatic cleaning system, then not using it?There are two bits of bad news.  First is the cost.  These things are very pricey; if you clean every day, and if a cartridge lasts about 30 cleanings, you'll spend about $60 per year.  That's just the way it goes.  You could easily pour the cheap or even home-brew cleaner of your choice into the empty cartridge, but that would be a VERY bad idea.  Whatever you put in won't have the lubricants that the factory liquid does, and that will cause your replaceable but expensive cutter head to wear out faster.  In addition, some cleaners would probably damage the machine.Another bit of bad news is the mess.  You have to pry off two plastic lids then slide the brim-full cartridge into the cleaning base.  It is VERY difficult to do so without spilling some of the fluid.Having said all of that, though, the fact is that if you want to use the Braun shaver to its full potential, you have to buy these cartridges.  Life is like that sometimes...
B000050FDY Cleaned my shaver just as described. Great price. Too bad we can't get Obama and his kind to do as they promised.
B000050FDY i love Braun Syncro Shaver System Clean & Renew Refills and fit as expected.very good.i love it so much.i love braun's.
B000050FDY I've been using my Braun shaver and the refills for almost a year and a half. Like others, I thought the refills might last longer by cleaning my razor every other use. I eventually realized that the refill didn't last any longer, so now I use the cleaning function after each use. I get a fresh shaver for each use and feel as though I'm getting my money's worth from the refills. One note...I always save the cap/top of the refill. If you're planning on being away from your cleaning unit for several days or more, you should cap the refill. You're refill will last longer as you won't lose any fluid to evaporation.
B000050FDY Refits for Braun shaver.  Quick delivery and they smell well.  Each container lasts me a month.  If you clean shaver each day you may be to extend it up to 6 weeks.
B000050FDY My husband is pleased with the refills -- they work well. He really likes the razor -- very much!
B000050FDY Product was received undamaged, all cartridges were sealed and completely full.  The cartridges installed without incident and functioned properly.  The solution had the same fragrance as the previous store bought cartridge and appeared to perform as well.I recommend this product and would purchase again.
B000050FDY I find that cleaning the Braun shaver in the cleaning base with this solution just a couple of times a week is enough.  If you snap the cap back on the cartridge between uses, you can slow down the evaporation and make the cartridge last at least two months.  The bright blue solution will slowly turn gray from the accumulated whisker debris.  When it gets ugly enough, and when the level of liquid starts to get low from evaporation during use, you'll use your own judgement about when to start a new one.
B000050FDY I have been using these now for almost 10 years.  Every now and then I will go 2 months without buying more because of the price.  Let me tell you from experience that they do increase the shavers ability to shave closer and faster.  I think it must have something to do with the lubrication it provides the blades and internals of the shaving head.  For the best price though, buying them from Amazon and using subscribe and save 9on the 3 pack0 will get you the best price available.  So if you don't mind taking more time and working a bit more to get every hair and make it really close you can do without these (but you still MUST open the head and clean the whiskers out every now and then) or just spend the few bucks through S&S like I mentioned and have a quick easy close shave.
B000050FDY These aren't very cheap.  Like I read on other reviews, it's best to keep the &#34;lid&#34; and take the solution out and cap it when not in use.  This should add some life to each cartridge and save you some pennies.
B000050FDY just one of those everyday things that Amazon makes so much easier to keep up with. Works great, comes on a regular basis so I remember to take good care of the razor
B000050FDY I've been using a Braun shaver and these cleaning cartridges for over two years.  They are worth the money---the shaver is clean and glides over my face for each shave.For what it is worth, I'll add a comment that the Braun 8985 Series 5 shaver itself is one of the best-engineered products I have ever encountered. I'm always finding flaws in electronics, etc.  The Braun seems to defy me!!Some have complained about the price of the cartridges.  They are worth it as I have said.  You can keep the shaver clean by following directions to \"vibrate\" the hair clippings out and then use a brush---I've done this on trips of up to one month with great success, but that isn't like using the cleaner mechanism with liquid.
B000050FDY Not much else to say about these, but they keep my shaver clean.  Don't see any alternative to these so I keep buying.
B000050FDY OEM refills for Braun Cleaner / Charger.  They do a good job of keeping my razor clean, I usually clean it once a week.  Can't beat the price and convenience using Subscribe & Save.  Highly recommended!  Lasts a long time!
B000050FDY Works well and is designed exactly for the razor I have.  Gives the shaver a clean, fresh smell. Fits nicely in the holder as expected.
B000050FDY So these are a must have for the super smart man that saved up and got the best shaver in the world.Do we have to take a major hit on the wallet? Maybe. What's a Fiver in costs every 6-10 weeks, huh?I think I can swing it this year, but if hard times come and that kid gets re elected, if the greedy NYC & DC folk keep making gas & utilities costs higher, and we get hammered even worse--Then I heard you can refill these with 2-5 drops of lemon juice and a top off with cheap pharmacy isotropic rubbing alcohol to save a spot of cash. Manually clean and mechanically clean on alternating days or weeks if you want to be a frugal type. Consult youTube in a big way for tips on this ...It's important to not dispose of the cap, recap after cleaning cycles, and avoid evaporation or fast waste of the product.Do what I say, and you will stretch your cash from a 30 day reload to a 60-180 day reload.
B000050FDY You can by a lot of blades for what it costs to use this system.
B000050FDY Works great to keep my Braun fresh. I think Braun is trying to make a bunch of money on this by suggesting this be used daily, I use it once a week along with charging my cordless razor and have not noticed a difference in the quality of the shave from my Bruan 5 series. I estimate I get about 5 months of use out of one cartridge by rising all the hair off my razor before using and by putting the lid back on the solution when not using it.
B000050FDY It's exactly what i had when i bought the product. Works great and cleans my razor just right. Very happy with the purchase.
B000050FDY I ordered 6 of these, and the 1st one installed very easily. The whole unit seems well designed, and I only run the cleaner when it requires total cleaning.
B000050FDY Love the bulk pricing.  Perfect replacement.  Cheaper than buying locally with sales tax and more $$ per unit
B000050FDY These are pretty good refills and they last a good amount of time. The cost seems to be increasing since I first began using them, but they seem to clean the shaver and leaves a clean, refreshing scent.  I also like how this can be used in a variety of Braun models.
B000050FDY This solution works great at cleaning the razor, and we love the convenience of being able to buy them in bulk online so that we never run out and don't have to go chasing them down at a store.
B000050FDY My husband loves the razor this refill goes with.  Refill does an excellent job cleaning the razor each day.  When we travel we send one of the refills ahead of us so my hubby can use the razor.  The cost of these refills is well worth the cleanliness they give to the razor.
B000050FDY I have owned the  Braun Syncro for over two years now and I still love it as much as the day I bought it. The Clean & Renew cartridges are wonderfully convenient as they both clean and lubricate the shaver head in one step (the residual lubricant can be felt if you run your finger over the shaver head after each cleaning). The cleaning also leaves a fresh lemon scent.Now, the convenience comes at a price. The price of the Clean & Renew cartridges is definitely a concern for a lot of people, including myself. There are, however, a few things you can do to economize:(1) remove the cartridge and cap it after each cleaning to prevent the loss of the highly volatile alcohol component, or (2) if that's too much of a hassle, top of the cartridge with 91-99% isopropyl alcohol when the fluid runs low. (3) don't run the shaver through the cleaning cycle after *every* shave; do it only after several shaves (note: Braun advises that the cartridge be replaced after 30 cleaning cycles or 6-8 weeks WCF). (4) if you're really strapped for cash, you always have the option of cleaning the shaver head under running tap water! Just remember to lube the shaver head periodically with amachine oil.I absolute love these Clean & Renew cartridges! They will help to keep your Braun Synchro at its optimal performance to give you a shave that's just about as close as one you get from a blade!
B000050FDY If you have used the automatic cleaner for your Braun electric shaver you already know that the solution must periodically be replaced due to evaporation and use. This is a great process and such an easy way to clean and maintain your electric shaver. Furthermore, the daily cleaning makes for a smooth shave every morning.
B000050FDY My husband ordered this when he ordered his second Braun shaver, the Series 7-790cc. He says it easy-to-use and does a good job keeping the shaver in good shape (important since it does double duty, he shares the shaver with our teenaged son). Recommended.
B000050FDY There isn't a whole lot to say about these. I don't think there is any other type of refill you can get for your Braun razor cleaner/charger. I have never had an issue with these. They come in a cardboard box and not much other packaging. Very convenient.
B000050FDY Smells nice and fresh and keeps the razor clean.  Easy to install.  Fits and works as good as the original.
B000050FDY this braun razor is the best ever and the refills will last me 3 years to help keep the razor in tip top shape..before i bought the razor i always used blades to get a close shave BUT NOW this new razor does it all thank you
B000050FDY If you're looking for these then you must already know what they're for. The cleaning system works well and $4-$5 per month isn't too bad.
B000050FDY Unfortunately, if you own a Braun shaver, which give a great shave, you need this cleaner fluid. The prices here are better than I've found anywhere else so I keep coming back.
B000050FDY You need this refill Cartridge to keep your Braun shaver going and keep it clean for you. I will recommend anyone to try.
B000050FDY I have the Braun 8585 razor; see my review there for my thoughts on that.I do love the cleaning fluid despite what I think about the razor.  It works great - I've opened the razor after a cleaning cycle and the inside is spotless.  The smell is pleasant too.Best of all, it lasts.  One cartridge lasts me 3 months.  I only clean my razor when the \"normal\" light is on, or every 2-3 shaves.  The cost to clean my razor works out to less than $20/year.  That's a bargain to me.  No more brushes or hot running water!  Now if only the razor did a better job...
B000050FDY I bought my Braun razor with the full expectation of having to shell out some extra cash on the cleaning cartridge refills every once in a while. I like the cleaning function and I use the cleaning function after every shave. It's a great shaving system and I've been very happy with it so I don't see a reason for messing with it to save a few bucks by trying to make my own cleaning solution. The few times I've had to clean the razor with water (i.e. I was travelling) I noticed that my shave wasn't as close and smooth as when I used the cleaning system.I do clean as much hair from the razor before docking it to clean it in the hopes that the solution will last longer. I'm also going to consider resealing the cartridge between shaves since evaporation is a very big problem in reducing the life of the cartridges (thanks to other reviewers for suggesting that).
B000050FDY These cleaner cells keep the razor lubricated, from jamming between razor head change-outs, and are the best price i have found for them anywhere.
B000050FDY What could more convenient and economical than getting a pack of three Braun clean and renew refills every three months at a terrific price.No other retail store can match this deal.I clean my Braun razor daily and it is a pleasure to start the day using a clean and well lubricated shaver.
B000050FDY Get one of these, then get some 90% isopropyl alcohol from your pharmacy for pennies, then keep refilling it. Of course, you should not follow my advice since it is against what Braun recommends, so please ignore my silly suggestion. It appears that my shavers never read Braun's warnings because they just keep getting clean, keep smelling good, and keep working despite my illegal activities.
B000050FDY wonderful product. Works well. Leaves the cleaning to someone else. Self clean. I highly recommend this product. It actually works
B000050FDY gift
B000050FDY Having switched from a long time Braun user to a Norelco Sensotouch 3D I still have my 790cc Braun. When P&G; bought out Braun they discontinued the foil and cutter block with a generic that pales in comparison to Braun Optifoil. I switched to the Norelco and the cleaning system system is a marvel.However I still prefer my old Braun and was lucky enough to have bought extra foils prior to them being phased out. The Braun clean and renew system is still in my opinion the best there is. The solution strips the blades and foil of all gunk, oils and whiskers - it's like a brand new razor every morning.This is a great deal on a 4 pack of refills. Plus if you have a Prime membership you get Free two day shippin to boot. The frustration free packaging is a real plus and cuts down on waste - I choose it whenever it's available.
B000050FDY I have the Braun 9595 (my first \"real electric razor\"). At first I was a little bummed out that I'd have to spend $15 on these \"refills\" that I would probably need every few weeks. Well, I was wrong on my assumptions to say the least!1. The shaver gets super clean and smells great after a cleaning session.2. The cleaning solution also lubricates the shaver thus increasing life.3. The solution lasts about 2x as long as I thought it would.I started using the shaver around March 7. I shave 2 times a day thanks to a super heavy beard that grows super fast. I have a 6 oclock shadow at 10:00am... So, I tried to use the cleaning solution once a day but ended up using it twice a day (I shave in the morning and at night). Just today (April 9 2008) the low light came on. That means 1 cleaning cartridge lasts a little over a month with 2 cleanings per day for me.One thing I do that may help the life is after every single shave I take off the head - blow out the shaver and put the head under the faucet for 2-3 seconds. I know, why do this when you have a dedicated cleaning system, right? Well, for a $220 shaver, I'll do whatever I want. lol. Washing out the shaver head may have extended the life of the solution - I've seen this in other reviews as well.Sign up for the subscription and the price will go down 15%. I set it to 3 months (about when I'll need more refills). Compare that to buying razor blades every month for $20 and shaving cream every few months - this is a savings.
B000050FDY These cleaners do a decent job of cleaning the razor but after a lot of use it is stuck on there and requires manual scrubbing to clean them so I took a star of for that.  The other star missing is because they are expensive and they evaporate. Since they do this, I plug the cap back onto the container once it is done cleaning, raise the shaver up and just wait until the next time I need it.  I find doing this extends the life of one of these to probably double the time.  If it looks really clogged and dirty I just use it until I think it is not useful anymore.  It's a tough call, I want the razor cleaned once and a while but these things break the bank over a year of use so trying to cut back where I can.
B000050FDY The product appears to be correct but the box is different on the two boxes I ordered.  They are both the same part number.  When the order quantity of an item is two or more, the warehouse should make sure the delivered product looks identical.  I would never buy the same item with different packages at a local store, and Amazon should be more careful when pulling orders because this practice causes doubt that the product is identical.  I have had this same result on other Amazon shipments where the quantity of an item was more than one. Old vs. new stock packages are often different.  Some manufacturers even totally change the product while keeping the part number the same (no revision letter change).
B000050FDY Guys if you have a thick beard that is prone ingrown hairs, this product may be your solution. By cleaning and lubricating my Braun shaver with this solution, I have significantly reduced painful razor bumps. While the shave isn't as close as premium blades, the loss of pain is well worth the shortcoming.Two tips: 1) I  recommend cleaning the hair particles out of the shaver manually so as to get the most out of the solution. Occasionally, I will even clean the foil and block with ethyl alcohol before placing the saving2) Prevent evaporation -- consistently leaving the saver in the stand will help preserve the volatile solution more effectively.  If you live in an extremely arid climate and are extremely frugal, covering the whole stand with 2 gallon zip lock bag might help.
B000050FDY Love the razor and these refills do the trick. The price is right and I'll buy these again. I avoid non-OEMs or generic refills.
B000050FDY Exactly what you find in the store for quite a bit less.  All braun owners know that you need to replace this close to once a month so to have regular shipments is critical and for the price. . you cannot beat this deal!!
B000050FDY There is nothing like the smell and feel of a newly cleaned electric razor.  I know they say to clean it when the yellow light comes on but this happens every 3 days.  I do not like leaving the whole unit out so I take the cleaning base out every Sunday, once a week.the solution does a very good job of cleaning it and it smells fresh on the next shave.  I only use it once a week and the solution lasts longer, it does not evaporate.  I estimate this 4 pack will last about one year.
B000050FDY This cleaner refill is the only one offered for the Braun shavers.  The options are whether you want 2, 3 or more refills at one time.  They last about 2 months each (I used them once a week) because they are alcohol-based and evaporation takes a toll on the fluid.  The cartridges fit in the cleaner that comes with the razors and they do clean and lubricate the cutting surfaces.
B000050FDY I am pleased that this does exactly what it is supposed to do...and my shaver is always in tip-top condition being cleaned with this solution automatically.  That said, I really find it COMPLETELY unnecessary for Braun to require you to buy an entire new plastic pack to go with every refill.  I would be far more satisfied cleaning out the old one and refilling it with new solution from a simple canister. I suppose the problem here is that this solution isn't the most environmentally friendly stuff ever...and while I'm all for destroying the world one tossed plastic pack at a time and such...I find it illogical and irritating to be getting charged for all this extra packaging every single time.  I wouldn't mind the environmentalists getting uppity about this and demanding an improved solution and/or packaging scenario even if it inconveniences me for a few years of legal battles and then research...but I'd really like to see more thought put into this (as opposed to the technically legal, yet astoundingly stupid, means this represents).  I would rather pay the same price for something representing a higher order of thought even if the solution and materials cost me more than this plastic-packaged monstrosity.
B000050FDY If you have any inkling you might not like the shaver .... because they won't let you return itFunny that it is save enough to mail to us but not save to mail back to them !!!!Very Bad PR for Braun Products !!!
B000050FDY This is the only type of refill that works with my Braun shaver. I found the best price and bought accordingly.
B000050FDY This product does a good job of cleaning razor. Product is over priced in general and use every other cleaning. Other times just clean head in water.
B000050FDY I hav ebeen a Braun user for years and I have always used this product/cartridge for the cleaning station for my shaver. bulk and the discount, was a plus.
B000050FDY I purchased a four pack of these with my new razor because these are more expensive almost everywhere else that I have looked for them locally.
B000050FDY If you search around, you can find the best price when you buy these in bulk. These work great with the Braun Shaver system... and you've got to have them... so buy a pack at the best price! I found them on Amazon at different prices (and the best price was here with free shipping and no tax)... but I've also found them elsewhere on the web for less at other times... check before you buy!
B000050FDY New shaver any time you want. Great stuff. Smells good. Cheap and fast ship from Amazon. Well done Braun!
B000050FDY Great deal and great packaging. After each use, I make sure to seal up the cartridge and keep it separate from the cleaning unit. This avoids the evaporation problem and they last longer. Only take a few seconds to do this each time and I only use the cleaning unit about every 10 shaves anyways.
B000050FDY It's good to be able to get this product in bulk to help reduce the cost.Since this is made by a Braun approved source in Ireland you be sureit won't harm your razor.
B000050FDY I purchased 2 of the 4 counts because it was the best deal. They seem to work just fine. The only thing I see that is not the same as the ones I get local is they are not in a braun box and the lable is not the same other wise they seem to work fine.
B000050FDY I needed these refills for my Braun shaver.  Product works fine but I am disappointed in the shaver, which was very expensive.  Maybe I have the wrong facial hair.
B000050FDY Does a good job of cleaning, but is a little expensive for the amount of time that it last. Walmart does carry this product for refills.
B000050FDY Easy-to-use and keeps my series 7 Braun in tip top condition. Take good care of my series 7. Help save on your investment
B000050FDY YOU CAN THREE FOR LESS THAN THE PRICE OF TWO. KEEP YOUR SHAVER CLEAN AND OILED. SMELL GREAT TOO.
B000050FDY I like the fresh smell and clean feel the Braun refills provide. I wish they would not evaporate so fast. I have noticed that when I return the razor to the cleaner each time, it lasts longer than if I leave the razor out.
B000050FDY Great for your Braun Clean and Renew Shaver.  A must have if you have this shaver. Great that it comes in a four pack
B000050FDY Balk at the concept of paying for these refills all the time, but the bottom line is that this is a really good system to care for a quality electronic. I don't mind buying these at all, I know that my shaver will be clean and tip top every time I use it, and with no effort. I enjoy throwing the spent ones away and seeing all the junk in them that I know is not in my shaver.
B000050FDY This is a very sanitary shaving system. I have used these for 6 years. I used to get nasty ingrown hairs that would get infected, this has helped significantly. If you have the same problem, try not to touch your face with your hands immediately after shaving, that with Braun shavers has made a big difference for me. Extend the life by recapping them and storing them outside your charger.
B000050FDY I hate having to buy these, because you are essentially paying for a piece of filter material and some alcohol. Still, once your shaver goes through the cleaning cycle, it comes out feeling brand new, and shaves like new as well. The liquid contains a lemon scent and some lubricant for the razor, and the end result is almost worth the high price.To get a better deal, use the Amazon subscribe and save option, I get mine shipped every 6 months, and save 15%.
B000050FDY I buy this product with the 'Subscribe & Save' Amazon feature.  It beats going to the store and having someone unlock a case where this product is stored.  And, I save money too.
B000050FDY If you have a Braun Electric Razor with Cleaning Station, these are a must to keep it clean and fully charged with no trouble.
B000050FDY Excellent product and good price. Bought for my husband who uses this system and he loves the cleaning system. Good buy.
B000050FDY Overpriced for what it is but I have been buying it for my razor cleaning system for a long time just out of convenience.Pretty sure it is the same type cleaning fluid my barber uses for his combs and razor heads but difficult to tell since they don't tell you what is in in. I like it anyway !
B000050FDY These go on sale from time to time, you can save quite a bit if you buy them in bulk when they're on sale.
B000050FDY There's not too much to say about these...they do what they're supposed to!  I clean my razor using the self-cleaning system nearly every day and it really amazes me how clean the razor comes out.  Not only is it clean, but it's lubricated and smells nice.  It truly does feel like you're using a brand new razor every day.  There are lots of reviews on here complaining that the stuff doesn't last long enough, but I find that they last about a month if you use them fairly regularly, and that's about what I'd expect from them.  Sure, you can only use them once a week, seal them in between uses, and make them last a lot longer.  But, I don't find them overpriced and I like that my razor is clean and fresh every day.  It's much faster than thoroughly cleaning the razor yourself, and works better than just using a brush and water.
B000050FDY You open your Braun cleaning station, slide out the old cartridge and slide in one of these.  Next time you dock/charge your razor, it's cleaning like new. Holy crap batman! Amazing.I wish these were a bit cheaper.  Seriously.  $20 for 4 plastic containers manufactured by children in China, filled with alcohol, coloring, and some other solvent.  It actually seems like a waste. Why not just sell big bottles with the cleaner that we could pour into the container that comes with the razor?
B000050FDY I've been using a Braun Syncro shaver system for quite some time, and have always used the Clean & Renew refills to keep my shaver clean, lubricated, and ready to go for the next shave.  Cleaning with these isn't a necessity, but it does take away the chore of having to do it myself.The cost of these, in my opinion, is worth the price for a smooth shave every time without any fuss of having to take the shaver apart to clean it, or having to remember to make sure to lubricate the blades as frequently - plus the lemon scent is a nice added bonus!
B000050FDY Though one can do it yourself with some Rubbing Alcohol, and scent/lubricant packs, the price is fair enough.  I took a look at the 4 pack and it's less costly than the break down of either the 12 pack or 6 pack shown on Amazon, so I bought 3 packs of the 4 refills, and saved a fair amount.
B000050FDY These cartridges are easy to use and they keep my razor clean and smelling fresh; buying the cartridges this way reduces considerably the amount of packaging
B000050FDY The big difference about buying the refills at Amazon is that I save a lot of money.  So if you have a Braun clean and rinse cartridge shaver you'd be very smart to purchase them in the four count box from Amazon!
B000050FDY Supposedly this keeps the blades clean and sharp. It sure seems to work. But after about 1-1.5 months, the fluid seems to stop working regardless of how many times you've used it to clean the razor.So plan on buying more than a few of these. For certain it really cleans the razor and so far the blades are only about half as dull as they normally would be. So a big plus, but I really don't like having to buy all these accessories and you can't travel with these as they are flammable. I wonder how just plain alcohol would work instead as it'd be a lot cheaper. Just bring an empty container and fill it with alcohol?I'd like it if these refills weren't flammable so I could take them on the plane and also if they were cheaper, and lasted longer than a month.
B000050FDY I have used this product for years. I don't have a heavy beard, and sometimes I shave in the shower, so I usually don't clean my shaver with this product more than once or twice a week and it works fine. I can definitely feel the difference after my shaver has been cleaned using this product.I agree that using this product is not inexpensive over time, but to me this is just a cost of maintenance (like periodically changing the oil in my car). Also, if my shaver has had heavy use without using this product (like when I go away on vacation for a week), I use a brush to clean out the shaver before using this product.
B000050FDY I use the Amazon Subscribe and Save for these Clean & Renew refills. With the S&S; discount, the price is about $3 cheaper per refill than the local stores.In terms of needing these, well, I've yet to take my shaver on a trip of a week or so and not have it tell me to clean it after 4 shaves. This is with running water over the blade and grill.I shave every other day and clean the shaver every time, as long as I'm home. Every time I pick it up, at home, it does as good a job as it did when I first bought it. When I travel and don't clean it so the light goes out, the shave takes much longer and isn't as close.So you save money in the long run going electric, until they figure out ways to ensure you still have to buy something from them, much the way the replaceable blade shavers do. If you can get over that and want to have a close shave, as close as it can get to the brand new feeling, then purchase these. I recommend the subscribe and save option as well, and just put it on a 6 month schedule. That's how mine is set and using the clean function every shave (every other day), the cartridges seem to last about 6 weeks or more.
B000050FDY Sure, one could mix up some mineral oil, alcohol, and water and it'd probably work, but this is convenient and it works so well with the Braun cleaner that I'm sold on it. I use the periodic shipment from Amazon to save money and make sure I always have some on hand. If you like a clean razor, this is a good product to use.
B000050FDY The ability to buy these in a three pack with free shipping is a great deal.  You don't have any choice if you have the Braun razor that uses these, but this sure makes it convenient and a fair price.
B000050FDY This is probably one of the best improvement for maintaining ones electric shaver.  I have mine now for more than 5 years cleaning it with the solution  and together with replacing the cutter block every 12-18 months (depending on how much facial hair it cuts), my shaver is still working like it is brand new.  I don't need to clean the shaver every day.  I clean it once a week and it is good to go.
B000050FDY First of all...I have never used a electric shaver before I got my Braun Pulsonic last year.  I have never had to worry about cleaning solutions etc etc...  I am not AFFILIATED with Braun in any way.  Just a consumer.People are complaining about spending $5 a month on these cartridges....while I understand that it seems like robbery..it is NOT!The cleaning cartridges not only clean the shaver but also add much needed lubricants to the shaving heads.  This process alone increases the lifetime of the blades and the electric shaver.I spent a ton on razor blades and shaving cream in the past...so these cartridges are of no significant cost to me.Last but not least...if you dont want to run the razor through a cleaning cycle daily, you dont have to.  Do it every 2-3 days and one cartridge will last you over a month....easily.  Last one I had was used for about 48 days...yes I counted.Thanks
B000050FDY They work as designed.  They are a better buy here than at wallmart.I need seven more stupid words to finish this.
B000050FDY I have been using these for several years now.  I wish they would last longer than they do for there is a bit that evaporates over time.  But, it does a nice job cleaning the shaver.  It is recommended to NOT refill these with alcohol, although i often check these and when they are around 2/3's full, i will add some alcohol and fill it back up.  I do it only the one time and this makes them go further.I did that once when the unit was about 1/4 full... and it actually made it more difficult to get my shaver clean.  However, at 2/3's full or 3/4's full... and then adding some alcohol... that works well and i get an extra 2 week'ish.Thanks.
B000050FDY I no longer have the shaver which requires these since this liquid eventually starts to eat away at the shaver itself.  I replaced the shaver with a Panasonic that uses water/soap based cleaning solution instead of chemicals.
B000050FDY These are Braun refill cartridges that come in a brown box.  Nothing fancy but that's not what I was looking for in this product.  I've used Braun shavers for about 12 years now and like 
B000050FDY Each cartridge lasts a little longer than a month and is necessary to keep the foil and blades clean and sharp for a first-class shave every morning.
B000050FDY Hubby loves his shaver and this cleaning option.  Cartridges last a reasonable amount of time with daily use and are easy to replace.
B000050FDY These are the same ones I have to pay about $12 for at Wal-Mart.  If you use these a lot like I do, it's the best value.
B000050FDY One pack will last you a year if you close it back up after use and only clean once or twice a week.I can't see leaving the lid open 24/7 as the thing would evaporate and the clean cycle only takes about 5 or 6 minutes to run.
B000050FDY The Braun cartridge refills keep my shaver clean and lubricated, without me having to do a thing. Just shave and then put your shaver in the Braun cleaning device and let the cleaner do the rest. The cartridges do get a bit pricey though, so I would suggest shopping around for the best price.
B000050FDY They work well in cleaning my series 7 electric razor. Only problem is they don't seem to last very long. Although I knew that before buying the razor.
B000050FDY This works well and functions as it is supposed too. I dont have much expectations however. Cleans better than just washing the blades
B000050FDY Not much that I can say other than the price of these is much better on Amazon so I get them here. The product works great and keeps my razor in top condition. The only thing I have noticed is that once a razor is a few years old I think the product starts to wear the painting / coating on the plastic. Mine razor has started to discolor a little as well as bubble / peel near the area the cleaner hits. Really this is a non-issue, most razors I have had that cost well over $200 dont even seem to last that long, just figured I would mention it. Not much you can do really, you have to clean the razors and these cartridges are what most require in some form.
B000050FDY What a wonderful product! No more cleaning my razor by hand, and no more razor burn! I'm so glad my wife bought the Braun razor with the self cleaning station for me last year for Fathers Day. I've never had it so good :-)I don't have dense beard growth, but I still have to shave once a day, so the cartridges last me a long time. I've used two since Fathers Day, for what's that's worth.
B000050FDY My husband loves his Braun shaver and these refills clean the shaver spotless. It's the only way to look acceptable without having to use the wet shaver every morning for him.
B000050FDY I love this cleaning system, it works well and seems to be reliable. Subscribing on the refills makes the price even better.
B000050FDY this is a must if you have the braun razor, I like this better then the one that comes with the shaver. this stuff has a nice lemony smell to it
B000050FDY Braun Clean & Renew Refills (3 Pack)This is the best cleaning product to buy, if you own one of the great Braun Shavers.  This does the best job of cleaning and also Lubricating all the parts, not to mention the \"Blades\" so they coninue to provide you with a wonderfuly close shave for as long as possible (because replacing the blades and the screen is not cheep).The fact that Amazon is offering this Cleaning and Lubricating Cartrige in a three pack, that as far as I know (and boy have I looked) is not sold in Retail Stores, is an even greater deal, but on top of that, they sell this three pack for only a few dollars more than the Two Packs everyone else sells.So Thank You Amazon, for finding and offering us a great deal on this product.  I look forward to finding more savings like this on items we all need in our daily lives. Then many more people will join and buy from Amazon, as you continue to show these Big Box Stores that they can not continue to rape the American public on necessities, because someone like Amazon will always step up and share there savings onto their customers.  This is how this country will become what it once was.  Thanks Again Amazon.....
B000050FDY A very pleasant scent and it works quite well at cleaning my Braun razor. So far, the razor has lasted me five years of daily use. Quite impressive. The only thing I will mention is that this is composed primarily of alcohol and it does evaporate.  I don't clean my razor everyday but probably should because I am not saving much when one considers the evaporation.
B000050FDY I usually refill my own with a combiation of rubbing alcohol and witch hazel but at around $3 each this was a no brainer.
B000050FDY These are the refills for the Braun 7000 series, easy to put in and necessary to clean my shaver so these are awesome and important to me lol.
B000050FDY I LOVE my electric razor... I have a fairly thick beard and dark hair, this is the first electric razor I've ever owned that I could use everyday.  I used to have to blade shave about every other day to look halfway clean shaven.  The self-cleaning function of the razor is one of those things that I just kind of felt like ok...  it's there, but had absolutely no influence on my decision to purchase.  That said... this stuff is just too expensive.  If you use the self cleaning function all the time you are looking at probably $50 to $60 a year just to clean your razor.  I wish, as others who have reviewed this, that they would package up the fluid and let you just refill the plastic cartridges.  It's probably the only negative I see with this razor after a couple years of use.  I will say though that it does do the job nicely.  I've run out of liquid and used the razor for a few days without cleaning and I could feel a difference.  Hence the title of my review, it's the price that prompted me to give 3 stars, not the performance.  It does it's job nicely.  Thanks for taking the time to read my review.
B000050FDY I finally found this at a better price than I could have at the local wal mart. I do try to stretch it out with one or two doses of rubbing alcohol.
B000050FDY I am not a daily shaver so I only replace the refills every 8-9 weeks. Even after that period of time, there is still 1/3 of the liquids left but for hygienic reasons you would probably want to change the refill anyway. I think the refills are reasonably priced and keeps the blades all clean for the next round.
B000050FDY What is there to not like.  Good price and clean lubricated razer.  It would not let me just tell my opinion without adding more words
B000050FDY The Braun Clean & Renew system is a great way to rejuvenate your electric razor, especially given that my last razor had a tendency to be hard to clean by hand.  The problem with owning a Clean & Renew (or \"Clean & Charge\") system is that refills like this cost yet more money for a razor you already bought the Clean & Charge system for, and for which you also know that you'll be buying blades and foils.Here then are the best ways to save money when you're buying Clean & Renew refills:- This product can be bought two ways:  as a pack of three or a pack of two. The price of each changes from time to time.  When you need to buy more, take a moment's basic math to figure out the best price per unit.  Sometimes the per-unit price of three is a better deal than the price for just two, and vice versa.- You don't need to use this system every day, or even every week.  I bought my system from a Braun store that also did repairs and the owner (who also owned a 7526 like mine) told me he uses the cleaner every two weeks.  He also said...- When using your Braun razor daily, take 10 seconds when you're done and run it with the foil clicked loose (but still attached).  The blade inside will shake like a wet dog and drop loose particles into your trash or sink...meaning less build-up when you go to put it in the clean and charge...and the fluild lasts longer- When you're not using the clean & charge system, pop open the Clean & Charge base, slide out the Clean & Renew refill, and put the cap back on it.  This will keep the alcohol from evaporating and the fluid will last longer.- This product is often eligible for free Super Saver shipping if you buy more than $25.  Either buy two three-packs and get free shipping, or buy these when you need to buy a blade and/or foil replacement (which are also often eligible for free Super Saver Shipping).  It doesn't make sense to pay $5 to ship a $10 or $15 item.  I typically buy a set of these when I'm on my last one, and usually only when I happen to be buying something else that'll push me over the limit and save me some money.I like the Braun Clean & Charge system, and my Braun 7526.  I don't like being nickel-and-dimed on all the bits and pieces that keep it working as well as it does.  With a little planning, I get the most bang for my buck out of these bundles.
B000050FDY I purchased my Bruan shaver with clean system about 8 years ago.  I use to be able to go to Walmart and purchase the refills, but here lately Walmart has not had them in stock.  So I had to go online to find them and of course Amazon did.  Not only was the refills cheaper, but instead of getting a 2 refill pack I was able to get a 3 refill pack cheaper than what Walmart sold with only 2 in their package.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who own a Braun shaver with a cleaning system.
B000050FDY Not a bad value for this quantity. Beats having to run out to a store to find these especially in larger than a two pack.
B000050FE0 Seems accurate. Requires ears not be clogged with wax and requires some care in aiming so the eardrum is seen by the sensor, not just the lining of the ear canal. A look at illustrations of the anatomy of the ear might be a good idea. Not suitable for rectal use.
B000050FE0 We've had the Braun Thermoscan for several years now. It does have some really nice features.The probe cover detector is nice, ensuring that the probe stays clean. The probe cover ejectoris also nice - so you don't have to pry the covers off.My problem is not that this isn't a good thermometer, but I've never been able to take anaccurate temp with this. Not that it's off a wee bit sometimes, but I never get a good temp.How can I tell? Because you can tell when a child is hot, and I usually get temps below 98.Our younger teen daughter is the only one who can ever get an accurate temp with this, so Iknow we don't have a defective model - unfortunately, no it's just me!  LOL  I have the sameproblem with a temporal thermometer - so I know the problem is with me!I'd very much like to find a thermometer that's quick, easy to use - even for someone whoisn't good at getting gadgets to work for them, and isn't a mouth or rectal thermometer.If anyone has any ideas for me!
B000050FE0 Braun IRT 4520 Ear Thermometer is an excellent device for taking temperatures, especially in small children and infants. Most families have an oral thermometer and some use other types, like rectal or those that are placed under the armpit. These other thermometers are generally ok with certain age groups but when it comes to the very young, an ear thermometer is the best option. And the Braun IRT 4520 is one of the best on the market.This thermometer gives accurate results in about 30 to 45 seconds. They way it accomplishes its task is by using infrared technology to measure the level of heat generated by the eardrum and other tissue. Some may question the ear as an accurate place to measure ones' body temperature but according to many medical experts, the ear actually provides greater accuracy than oral and other types of thermometers.Of all the pluses with this device, the most important among them is the ease of use. Babies generally don't like anything placed inside their ears but they don't resist this type of thermometer like they do others. I had tried using the armpit style thermometer but the squirming and crying was too much. With this, there is still a little bit of annoyance for both your baby and you but it is nothing compared to the aggravation caused by other types of thermometers.On occasion, this thermometer may have a problem producing an accurate measurement and when it does, it will let you know on the display panel. For example, if the tip isn't inserted properly in the ear, you will get the error code \"POS\", indicating that the positioning is not secure. If the surrounding air is too hot or too cold (needs to be between 50 and 104 degrees Fahrenheit), you will get the \"Err\" error message. If a person's temperature is far too high or too low, (outside the 93.2 to 108 degrees Fahrenheit range) you will get \"HI\" or \"LO\". If this happens, don't panic- chances are you didn't insert the thermometer correctly or the filter isn't clean. Replace the filter if necessary and try again.One of the many nice things about this device is that it comes complete with batteries. This may not seem like a big deal but it is no fun when you buy a new electronic device, race home, and discover you forgot the batteries. Braun knows that when people buy a thermometer, it is usually because they need to use it immediately. They don't want the unexpected surprise of having no batteries. Braun includes these for your convenience. And the fact that the batteries are ordinary AA is also convenient because this type of battery is easy to find.Yet another plus with this thermometer is that it stores the last temperature in memory. This temperature will display when you turn the unit on, allowing you to see the last reading and compare it to the reading you are about to take. This is nice because it takes the guesswork out of the task. Often, a pediatrician will ask if you know the previous temperature so that he/she can make comparisons and check progress in the case of illness. With this device, it is right there, on the panel when you turn it on. And when you take a new temperature, the reading remains on the screen for sixty seconds for your convenience.Could this thermometer be improved in any way? Well, I can only think of a few minor things. One would be a gripping surface- perhaps a small section around the middle with a rubber covering to help consumers hold the device more firmly in place. Another possible improvement would be a lighted display panel, just in case you need to use the thermometer in a dark place. These and other changes could make the thermometer even more appealing, but they are minor and shouldn't count for much in a buying decision.To keep things as sanitary as possible, it is important to always replace the lens filter before each use. This is a small plastic cap that fits over the tip of the measuring device and it needs to be replaced after each use. These replacement filters can be purchased in most drug stores and on- line at a cost of less then ten dollars for a pack of forty. This is an added cost for owning this type of thermometer. But any type of thermometer is going to include its share of cleaning/sanitation costs so, again, this shouldn't have too much affect on one's decision to buy.Overall, this thermometer has proven itself a godsend for me and my family. The ease of use, the memory storage of the last temperature reading, and the long battery life (about two years or 1000 measurements) make this a must have for anyone with babies or toddlers. It eliminates much of the fussiness and frustration common with other thermometers and even though it carries a hefty price tag, it is worth the extra cost.
B000050FE0 I prefer this ear thermometer to my other one. The need for a lens filter may turn off some buyers, but I like it for the fact that they keep the lens clean and ready to use. The case the thermometer snaps into holds the filters for easy to reach convenience.The thermometer gets accurate readings quickly and easily. It only takes a second. My other ear thermometer took longer and I could never aim it just right. The other one also doesn't have a lens filter, which made it more inconvenient because I always had to make sure it was clean and then hunt down the alcohol to clean it with.This thermometer is tops in my book. I highly recommend it.
B000050FE0 My wife purchased this digital thermometer after pouring herself over hours of research and reading. Being an audiophile and a Registered Nurse, she's one of those people that reads the manual on everything first, never makes an impulse purchase and often times calls the company directly via the phone numbers listed on the packaging (which she usually copies down in the store).I had purchased a different thermometer for her as birthday present, but that's a whole other story. Needless to say the Braun Thermoscan Thermometer was her preferred choice. The reasons are thus:1.The readings this device give are the most accurate for any ear thermometer on the market at any price. This should be the most important reason - all - the time.2.The sterile caps are a necessity and even if you're only using the device on one child you should do everything in your power to cut down on ear infections.3.The reading it takes occurs very quickly.4.The beep is more for me than it is for her, which she thinks is a must. Removing the device early is a common mistake.5.The 'ease of use' makes taking an ear reading a simple matter. Easier than oral, rectal or armpit and a world of difference over the newer Temporal Thermometers.6.The storage of 1000 readings which is a blessing when you have to look back at the data, and some of us do.My son likes this thing so much he quickly figured out how to stick it in his own ear a few times and press the button and wait for the beep, which caused my wife to scowl and panic, but of course I just thought my son was gifted like all foolish parents out there.The cost of the small plastic filters is incredibly minimal as is the actual cost of the device itself. Sure, you can go to Target or Wal-Maze and buy yourself another cheapie, but then you'll be back exactly where you are now sometime later ... looking for a dependable and accurate ear Thermometer.This is currently the best.... ...
B000050FE2 These fit myBraun Thermoscan Ear Thermometer with ExacTemp Technologyperfectly. The box of 20 fits right in the case for storage.
B000050FE2 I like using these filters on my thermometer.  They are extremely easy to use and dispose of properly.  I would recommend them
B000050FE2 The Thermoscan brand filters come in a little box that fits into my Thermoscan case.  It's so easy and convenient to use.  The filters fit my Thermoscan with ease.  I have no problems.
B000050FE2 Works well.  Great price!  keeps it sanitary and helps to give accurate readings.  Everywhere else you get it at, you will pay at least double what you would pay here.
B000050FE2 I USE THE BRAUN LENS FILTERS FOR MY EAR THERMOMETER.REPLACING EACH TIME WE USE THE EAR THERMOMETER.A GREAT BUY.
B000050FE2 These are great replacements. If I am sick or someone in the house is we reuse the same one for that person to make these last longer. But for different people we toss out the old one and use a new one.Very happy with the Braun thermometer and these are cheap enough to buy.Keep in mind these aren't meant for children so when you toss them out please dispose of them properly so little kids don't swallow them.
B000050FF0 This is great when you come home for a long day of work to sit down and relax. But the major problem is that it automatically turns off after 45 minutes and you need to wait about 7-10 minutes before the messager returns to its normal operation. I was expecting more from a $30 messager. This is a great product if you don't mind a quick message, but unfortunately you can't have it up to a full hour.
B000050FF0 I wish I had listened to the other negative reviews. But since I had a great promotion coupon (got it for almost free), I decided to ignore them and try it out for myself - now I wish I hadn't!It definitely is NOT a massager, just a vibrating machine. Now I must confess that I wasn't 'fooled' or 'tricked' or anything, I knew it would vibrate. I just figured that with so many positive reviews I might like the vibrating action. Trust me, if you're not sure whether you'll like a vibrating machine at your foot, chances are you WON'T.Since I can't return this product due to the promotion, I've learned how to 'tolerate' the vibrations by putting only portions of my foot on the machine at a time. For instance, I just use the ball of my foot or the toes only - then the vibrations don't feel so bad. Still, who wants to learn how to 'tolerate' a product!As for the infra-red heat - I think most other reviews said the same thing, it's lukewarm at best. I seriously doubt it could keep you warm in winter.So unless you actually like vibrating machines at your feet (or if you get it for practically free like I did) I would strongly recommend that you NOT waste your money with this product.
B000050FF0 best for the buck!  the IF heat feature is nice, the foot massage is good....have to spend alot more to get a better foot machine
B000050FF0 The problems with this unit are:1. The electric cord is about a foot too short.2. The vibrator is underpowered. You'll use the device on the high setting all the time, and still not get the relief you need.3. The unit is so light, that it moves around on a smooth floor (it's okay on a rug).Overall, the impression is one of cheapness.
B000050FF0 I have a number of Homedics products from the full body massager to handheld, to a neck thing and love all of them.  They are great.  While at Goodwill on $1 Thursdays, I picked up this foot massager for $1.  It works great.  All the good and bad stuff about this from the reviews - it vibrates too much, moves all over the floor, etc.  Yes, it does all those.The heat works great.  The vibration works great, though, I would keep the vibration thing on for probably more than 5-10 min.  I feel my whole body vibrating.  Anyway, I keep this under my desk with a big towel under it to keep it from slipping too much.  For $1?  I couldn't even get a $1 burger from McDonald's for less expensive.Great buy and find for me.
B000050FF0 If you are looking for a dual purpose item, this will serve you well as a foot massager and foot warmer. When I first placed this under my desk, it rattled around a bit and scared my cat, who ran terrified down the hall. But, don't fear...once you place a towel or carpet under the unit, it is fine and very quite. You just hear a gentle hum.You will be amazed at how light your legs feel after just a few minutes. All the controls can be turned on and off with your toes! That alone is a great feature. This unit has special \"Toe-Tap\" features. You can turn on the lo/hi vibration intensity button with your big toe of your left foot. The Heat on/off button can be pressed with your right big toe and then the massage on/off button is easy to turn on with your heel. You can also turn the lo/hi and on/off button with your heelThe unit feels warmer when you turn the massage function off and could be used in those cold days of winter when you just don't feel like wearing slippers. Once you turn off the infrared heat function, you will still feel the heat for quite a while.The massage platform has raised accunodles (raised bumps in the plastic) for the stimulation of the soles of your feet.The instructions recommend only using this unit for about 15 minutes or less. I found 3 minutes was a good amount of time and produced the desired light leg feeling. This is a unit you use while seated and standing on it can cause damage. They also recommend using the unit with \"socked feet\" and never with shoes.The perfect gift for anyone who sits at their desk for most of the day or for those friends who stand all day and just want to come home, sit on the couch and relax.This unit will fit nicely under your bed (or some couches) or you might just want to keep it permanently under your desk!~The Rebecca Review
B000050FF0 For the price, this product isn't that bad, but don't expect too much from it.  The \"massage\" basically amounts to it vibrating a lot, which can feel somewhat nice, but not as much as I had expected.  As a runner, I've tried many different foot massagers and this one is on the slightly below average end.  The unit also doesn't put off much heat at all.  You can get more heat from sticking your feet near a light bulb.However, being able to control the product with my toes was fairly nice, and I do use it occasionally.  I just don't think it should have been labeled as a\"Pro Ultra.\"  There's nothing really \"ultra\" about it.
B000050FF0 A much needed treat for the part of all oue bodies that gets the most hammering! Fits neatly under your computer desk so what massage and warm your toots while browsing at amazon?It's well worth the investment and it is a health investment since it taps into reflexology principles which aim to treat your entire body. major organs and the works, from the soles of your feet.
B000050FF4 I used to stay in hotels 4 nights of the week when working out of town. Nothing worse for good sleep than noise, a strange place, and jetlag. If you get a smoking room or a stale-smelling room, it can be really be pretty bad. I used to put the television on a non-channel for the white noise (blocks traffic, elevators and voices a bit) and burn scented candles for the odors.The Homedics device is a lot better than burning a candle and having the TV on all night. I love the woodlands sounds and aromatherapy sure works for me (and certainly gets rid of that &quot;hotel&quot; smell as well.)If you travel or know someone who has to be on the road, this is a great thing to take with. And if you have a fussy baby, sometimes it can help (although I lent one recently to a friend with a colicky kid but he still preferred to be in a car, driven round and round and round and....)
B000050FF4 used it and finally wore it out a few years later and just lately threw it awaw.  turns itself off
B000050FF4 This is a nice way to keep a small room smelling pleasant, even if you don't subscribe to the whole aromatherapy thing. The sound generator is just marginal, with some sounds less than relaxing and the lack of a functional volume control a problem.I think scented candles and an environmental CD that you like would be better, though as a package deal and at this price, it's not too shabby.
B000050FF4 The sounds on this machine provide the perfect white noise for our 6 month old, who is an incredibly light sleeper.  It really helps her sleep better.  The aroma beads also come in handy to cover up the 'diaper' smell when necessary.  It is very easy to use and has been running with no problems for over a year.
B000050FF4 I bought this for my aroma-therapy and natural sounds addicted wife.  It is a now a paper-weight.  the sounds are not very natural and the smells are well...smelly.
B000050FF4 The idea sounded good, but the machine doesn't. First of all, the sounds are poorly done in that they repeat on a very short loop and do not sound natural, especially: brook and spring rain. The ocean is a recording of one wave that repeats with a drip at the end which is more annoying than relaxing. The white noise option sounds like a TV that has been left on while the station went off the air.Secondly, the machine will only run for either 15, 30 or 60 minutes then shuts off automaticly. For someone who needs to have the noise run the entire time they sleep, this machine is useless.Thirdly, the aroma option is noisy to run and drowns out the selected sounds. The basket where you put the aroma beads vibrates and rattles which is another annoyance when trying to fall asleep. The scent is barely detectable unless you have the machine right under your nose. I even tried soaking a pad with essential oil, that works better than the scent beads that comes with the machine.I did give this two stars because if someone only wants the machine to run for 1 hour, and only wants to listen to white noise then this will work as long as you don't want the scent to go along with the noise. It does have volume adjustment, but I prefer just to leave the thing turned off. It was not expensive, but I do feel I wasted my money.My suggestion is to get a CD of ocean waves or nature sounds instead and to soak a cotton ball in essential oil and place it in a dish. It would be cheaper and would work better.
B000050FF4 I bought this based on other user's reviews and I am not unhappy.  This is a little noisy in the aroma mode but using the combo of aroma and ocean waves puts me out before the 60 minute timer shuts the unit off.  It works!
B000052WN3 Aleve helps me for my back pain but doesn't seem to help with most common everyday things like headaches.I alternate between Tyenol and Aleve. When one stops working, I switch back to the other. This is just about the same as Tyenol. Aleve may be a little bit better but it is more expensive.I would recommend this if you take Tyenol and it has stopped helping because your body has become adjusted to it. Aleve seems to be harder on the stomach so be sure to take with food.Another reviewer said it helped with her menstrual pains but it doesn't help me with mine. This does help me better than Tyenol with lower back pain.
B000052WN3 Of all the other over the counter remedies, I find Aleve the most effective pain treatment for my arthritic knees.
B000052WN3 I was amazed at how little I paid for this quantity. If you have arthritis, and you need an anti inflammatory, this is the one to buy.
B000052WN3 I get some monster migraines at times and this is the only thing that seems to work the best and the fastest. They work every time and within half an hour of taking it.
B000052WN3 Aleve is a good for pain and I was told it is not a blood thinner.  Very good buy and good service.
B000052WN3 Works almost as well as the commercial says it does. I discovered that taking 2 at bedtime instead of one every 12 hours worked the best for me.
B000052WN3 I like the Aleve product and this value size offering is great. Be warned: this comes in a rather large container. It won't be convenient to carry in a purse or pack in a suitcase. But, it is a great value if you like Aleve.
B000052WN3 This product definite helps with the pain.  Using 2  daily relieves pain as needed.  It is a choice produce.  I  recommend it.
B000052WN3 I am a long time Advil user.  I wanted to give Aleve a try because it's supposed to be longer-lasting.  It actually is longer lasting, therefore i give it 2 stars.  But the pain relief, for me at least, has been minimal.  I'm going back to Advil.  Four 200mg Advil will completely knock out my migraines.  The Aleve i used couldn't even diminish my knee pain or back pain.  At least not by the amount i was expecting.  For those interested in the size of the pills, the caplets are pretty small and easy to swallow, as are the pills.Update:  I decided to give these another try.  I've been having severe stomach cramps which i thought were due to the gelatin i was drinking.  Wrong!  I stopped the gelatin and cramps and pain continued.  Then i realized it might be the Aleve.  I only took one single pill a day, for maybe a week or less.  The cramps and pain i felt were very strong.  I'm once again returning to Advil or Motrin, neither of which ever gave me problems and also gave me much better pain relief.If you would like to read people's problems with Aleve, you can go here (Amazon please remove this link if this is inappropriate to publish here):  [...]Update #2..... It took six weeks for my stomach pain to go away.  There are many people who have had severe reactions to these pills.  I would not ever touch these again and I would advise others to stick with either Advil or Tylenol instead.
B000052WN3 Had tried the bottle of 100 and it worked so I bought some more and this is okay so far.
B000052WN3 I take Aleve twice per day. When I see my supply dwindling, I order more. Save money on the product, gas, and time.
B000052WN3 A great meta-analysis found this to be of less cardiovascular risk than any other NSAID, either prescription, or non.  While not without gastrointestinal risks, etc., a small amount of this over-the-counter, high quality product will relieve pain for many hours.  It may also be risky and may cause kidney problems if used over the long term.There appears to be little risk associated with short term risk if you follow the label directions.  Be sure to read the ENTIRE label and follow the directions carefully, and discuss any risks that you might have with your qualified medical professional.With long term use you should always follow up with your primary care provider who can prescribe medical blood tests to check for any problems that could develop: This is why this product comes in two strengths and one of them is prescription only.Many pharmacists have recommended this to patients, telling them that this is the most effective over the counter pain reliever as well.  While this information should not substitute for professional medical advice, this is a product that I keep on my shelf and use according to label directions.I like that it is made in Germany, and the tablets seem to be of very high quality.  I only trust Bayer brand, and I am certainly willing to pay a little more for the best product available in terms of quality, safety, and perceived very high quality assurance standards.
B000052WN3 The pricing on this was very good.  I will be purchasing this again in the future.  Thanks for the good deal.
B000052WN3 great price you get 270 for about the same price that you would pay for 90 if you bought three of the 30 per bottle.
B000052WN3 I have arthritis in my knees and I swear by Aleve for it. I've been taking Aleve for my arthritis for years. Without it, I am so stiff I walk like Frankenstein's monster.
B000052WN3 I only take Alleve -  best thing ever and seems to work for me and not others like Tylenol, etc. - great price
B000052WN3 Aleve is the only thing that works for my hangovers.  Trust me, I drink plenty and keep this near the bed.  2 Aleve and a bottle of water and I'm good to go.
B000052WN3 I get much more relief from this product and have it on hand all the time.  I don't need it often andthis price was so unreal-I have paid more for a bottle of 100 at my drug store.
B000052WN3 CAUTION: READ LABEL DIRECTIONS CAREFULLY BEFORE USING!!!Once again I am using Aleve with great results for a nasty lower back pain I get after sleeping all night and getting out of bed in the morning with a very stiff lower back. I'm getting older! The positive effects last about ten to twelve hours so I'm not popping pills every four hours; this is much more convenient and it makes me feel like I'm taking less medication. I should also mention that in the past, Aleve helped me many times when I had shoulder pain caused by a rotator cuff injury. The Aleve caplets contain no aspirin which is great for anyone who can't take aspirin because it causes them stomach trouble; and the caplets are not \"horse pills\" which can be difficult to swallow, either.Aleve also helps with minor aches and pains including headaches, menstrual cramps, muscular aches and it can temporarily reduce a fever, too. However, there are important cautionary notes on the package and the bottle--be certain to read those carefully so you don't take this product at the wrong time or for some reason that would make an alternative pain killer a better choice for you.Use these pills before any expiration date stamped on the outside, thin cardboard paper packaging. After that date throw these out and get a new bottle.I highly recommend Aleve for those of us who want an aspirin substitute; this is an excellent product!
B000052WN3 Works great on my fibromyalgia and arthritis. I use it along with another pain med and together they really help me get through my days.
B000052WN3 I basically refuse to take Acetaminophen whenever possible due to the health risks, so this is a great alternative to that for mild pain relief (headaches, etc).It's non-prescription, and won't work as well as prescription, but for mild pain it does the job.And none of the health concerns as with Acetaminophen!!!
B000052WN3 I give this product 3 stars because it is what it says it is.  If you like Aleve, it works.
B000052WN3 Works so well for cramps!  I used to take advil / ibuprfen... my doctor would perscribe naproxen... this is exactly what I was perscribed.  So now, a day or so before I'm expectng cramps... or when cramps are there... this just creates a good buffer to alleviate the discomfort!Has also been good for alleviating joint pain!
B000052WN3 I added this item to my monthly sub and save items.  I am up to around 20 items now with some coming every month and some coming every four months like this item.  The expiration date is two years out so I know I have received a good product.  As far as price it is just a little cheaper than store bought but since I can not shop in stores very easily ,extreme low vision, this fits the bill.
B000052WN3 I use this sparingly and when I do use it, it is effective and long lasting.  The price was right and I find this product is worth every penny, especially during cold and flu season.
B000052WN3 Somewhat effective pain killer.
B000052WN3 I go to Aleve when I experience a sprained back. It usually works & helps me out, certainly more than aspirin.
B000052WN3 I usually buy Aleve in a store, but didn't feel like going. Yes, I had to wait a few days, but it wasn't an emergency. I save a few pennies so I'm happy.
B000052WN3 My wife loves these but for some reason the mess up my heart medicine. I do like how you only need one for 12 hours.
B000052WN3 NICE BOTTLE, PRETTY PILL, NICE NAME, TOO BAD THEY DON'T WORK, HAD A PAIN IN SHOULDER BACK AREA, TOOK ALEVE WAITED 2 HRS. STILL HURTIN,
B000052WN3 I believe in this product, as well as my family, who all suffer with headaches. The price was excellent, pkg arrived quickly...no complaints!!
B000052WNY I chew one, sometimes two, at night before bed in the hopes that it will prevent a heart attack during the night. I read somewhere that the optimum time to take it is at 10 pm to prevent an attack in the wee hours.
B000052WNY Your Description:Even if it were perched on a spoonful of sugar, most aspirin tablets do not go down easily. But they do if they're chewable and cherry flavored. We bet Mary Poppins herself would have switched to these low-dose tablets if they'd been available when she was caring for the Banks family. In fact, Mr. Banks himself might have taken them, as they're designed for adults, too, especially those on a doctor-recommended daily regimen of aspirin.Funny you should mention that... Dick Van Dyke (the chimney sweep in Mary Poppins) lost his 13 year old granddaughter to Reye's syndrome after being given 'baby' aspirin!!  NO spoonful of sugar there!Further more, Bayer does NOT make this product anymore.  In 2007 the aspirin manufacturer's agreed to discontinue Childrens Aspirin due to Reye's Syndrome!  They will send you Bayer 81mg 'baby' aspirin - which will soon go the way of children's aspirin!  Why?This aspirin product is NOT for children under the age of 19!!This product is NOT used for children's headaches!! This product is NOT used for fever, teething, or any other symptoms in children without a Doctor's supervision!!This product has been proven to trigger Reye's syndrome a deadly and often fatal disease in children! Please learn more about aspirin and children at [...]!Please learn more at The National Reye's Syndrome Foundation's website!
B000052WNY I purchased these for my dad because he has to take them daily.  I now use them myself because they work so well.
B000052WNY I love the taste of these chewable low-dose aspirin from Bayer.  If you have difficulty swallowing pills and need to take a daily low-dose aspirin, these are for you!  Most of what you find in stores is orange flavored and I much prefer these cherry ones.  Each box contains enough for a whole month plus a few extra (yes, I have been known to drop one in the heater/air vent or even down the bathroom sink).
B000052WNY Bayer has good brand name recognition and makes quality products. This low dose aspirin is no exception. The cherry flavor is a nice alternative to orange.
B000052WNY If you're on an aspirin regimen, like myself, then you'll love these. It brings me back to my childhood and for something to do that its got to be good. Tastes great and you can tell they're Bayer. Love em.
B000052WNY My husband has been told by his doctor to take a low dosage aspirin daily. You can't beat this price anywhere.
B000052WNY I have a standard collie.  I give her this product when she hurts her leg or is under the weather.  She weighs about 55 lbs.  I sneak it in her food.  You can tell she is better in about an hour.  The pain is alleviated.
B000052WQJ I use this for everything; back pain, sore muscles, sprains, it works great on them all! It doesn't smell great, but not any worse than icy hot or something like that and you don't have to get it all over your hands to apply it. It feels sort of cool when you put it on, but warms up a la icy hot after a bit...but it really does help the soreness go away! I carry it in my purse for those moments when my back acts up and I need instant relief- definitely a great buy!
B000052WQJ The relief from pain in my feet and in my lower back comes after a few minutes of applying. It does has a medicine smell, but is not near as strong of a smell as most sports creams and ice/heat rubs. The 4 oz. bottle of Absorbine will last you a long time even with daily use. The defect I find is in the foam applicator, which causes too much to come out and run. I have to be careful when applying to my lower back or it easily can run down my buttcrack, which feels like hot lava.
B000052WQJ This product is a great pain reliever and has a nice smell. No offensive to clients I work with. Helps me with the pain of water retention in the legs.
B000052WQJ Being from Canada, I learned that this product was hard to come by in the USA pharmacies and was ordering it online through Amazon. Although this is not the 'extra strength' product, if you have never use Absorbine Jr. before then what are you waiting for?  Once you have used this all natural product you will find yourself using nothing else. I have a lower back pain issue that flares up every once in a while and using Absorbine Jr. always helps subside the pain.
B000052WQJ I didn't find that this worked very well for my arthritis (osteo), but it DOES work wonderfully on mosquito bites, especially if you use it on the bites as soon as you notice them. To me, it's worth it's weight in gold for just that reason. I purchasedAbsorbine Jr Pain Relieving Liquid, Original, with No-Mess Applicator - 4 fl oz, then theAbsorbine Jr Pain Relieving Liquid, Original - 16 fl ozto refill the bottle. I will purchase again next summer when those pesky critters come back.My husband doesn't like the smell, but I don't mind it at all ... and I don't care since it works!  :D
B000052WQJ I loved this, it has wormwood that helps with fungus problems and other skin irritations.  I used it in my youth 50 some years ago on a horse with saddle sores that would not heal.  the next day healing has started!  ole time remedies made from real plants work when synthetics only cause another problem!!!
B000052WQJ Dad's arthritis is kickin' in and he asked me to find some of the Absorbine Jr. Couldn't find it in local stores. Once again, Amazon and their partners to the rescue.It's helping his hands not hurt so much ;-}yay
B000052WQJ I bought this product today because it was recommended by my mother.  I got a spider bite on my temple and it caused quite a bit of swelling. So much that I couldn't wear my glasses because the head of the bit where the venom comes out was right where the band rides on my glasses.  The bite was causing pain and the Absorbine Jr. has helped.  It stings a bit on the wound but that is followed by relief and the relief lasted for a couple hours.My mom uses it for mosquito bites and says it's really good stuff.  I have to agree.
B000052WQJ This came very quickly, which is always a perk for me.  Does it work? Yes? It really helps sore, stiff muscles. When I have don't to much, I rub it on.  Better smell then be gay, but they both work. I like this form better myself, but that's just me.
B000052WQJ I have been using this liquid for years. The no-mess applicator is definitely the way to go. Absolutely a wonderful product.
B000052WQJ This is great for itches.  Poison ivy and bites.  But I can't find it in the store anymore.  So happy to find it on Amazon.  It relieves itching and dries up poison ivy.
B000052WQJ Will purchase again later.  Good for sore muscles.  This is an old product, remember my grandmother having it in her cupboard.
B000052WQJ i really like this and it helps my aches. it comes out fast so you need to apply it carefully. easy to use, works great.
B000052WQJ Its pretty good, its a lot like icy hot.  I guess I thought it would be stronger though.  Im using it on a sprained neck thats very painful so I didnt expect it to knock this kind of pain out completely but it helps ease the tension a bit.  My only complaint is it REALLY stinks.  Someone across the room from me at work asked me if I was eating a tunafish sandwich..lol.  It smells like tuna and kinda like rubber a little.  The smell makes me nausea after 3 days of use.  I never want to smell it again if my neck EVER heals...
B000052WQJ Absorbine Jr. is one of best \"old fashioned\", now, sadly little known products on market.I do use several \"legacy\" type products still including Absorbine Jr, Cornhusker's LotionPfizer Consumer Healthcare Corn Huskers Lotion 7 Oz&Corn Huskers Heavy Duty Oil-Free Hand Treatment Lotion 7 fl oz (207 ml)and Bag BalmBag Balm Antiseptic, 10 ozWhile not quite as effective on muscle aches to me as some other products like Icy Hot, it is still good and is fantastic on athlete's foot problems (burns like hades, but clears up mine in 2-3 days) and works extremely well on insect bites and plant sticker punctures and irritations.  Kids may howl and complain as it can BURN on broken skin / abrasions, but it works better than most of today's fancy (and expensive) products and does not have an perfumes or fragrances added.  It acts, works and SMELLS like a \"medicine\".
B000052WQJ Works for all kinds of stuff, wet use it on bug bites, but also use it add a repellant, we put it on our get and ankles when going outside in the evenings, keeps the mosquitoes away!
B000052WQJ My husband hates having to get smelly cream on his hand and try to reach his shoulder or lower back to apply the stuff.  He loves the roll on because he doesn't get it on his hand and it works good. The smell doesn't last too long either.
B000052WWV Many years ago, but about this time of year, I was in the hospital.  In addition to the reason that made me an inpatient, I had developed quite a red, itchy rash \"down there.\"  The (male) nurse gave me a little dose-cup of cream and a wooden coffee stick and suggested I apply it to myself after showering.  Recognizing the familiar smell and thickness of the cream as some version of Monistat, I asked, \"Why this?  I don't have a vagina.\"  The nurse, who was not easily shocked, replied \"Similar condition.  Hot, wet, anaerobic (oxygen-free).  Just use it.\"I did, and it worked--to a point.  But why, I asked myself, hadn't someone thought of taking one of the many athletic powders on the market and making Miconazole Nitrate (as in Monistat) its active ingredient?  That would combine a proven antifungal agent with the dryness and absorbent quality of an athletic powder. Several years later I was delighted to find this Zeabsorb type AF on drugstore shelves, and it has been a mainstay for my torrid zone every since.It's a simple combination but it works well for me: the powder dries, and the Miconazole Nitrate fights fungus.  It works great against my crotch rotch or any impending versions thereof.  It also keeps my summer armpits from getting \"withery,\" if you should be annoyed by that condition.  Since it is a fine enough powder to fight friction, it is refreshing and comfortable on the guy bits themselves, especially worn with summer cotton. Personally, it's just okay on my feet, not much better than original Desenex or even Gold Bond green label, but for simplicity's sake it has become my all-over, take-with powder. (Note that it is marketed as a remedy against athlete's foot.)  Be sure, when you buy this, to look for the wasp-waisted plastic bottle with the green strip in the middle; other reviewers have stressed that similar-looking products don't work as well.  Not everyone will warm to the smell, which is basically locker-room medicinal, slightly sweet.  Certainly it has the advantages of not smelling of kid stuff like baby powders, nor like menthol, but not SO macho people can smell you half a block away.  \"Get me some of that s--- that don't stink,\" said Kevin Costner's baseball player in the movie BULL DURHAM, and perhaps he had something like Zeabsorb in mind.Typically, Zeabsorb AF is not cheap, with a price at the premium end of mass-distribution powders.  I ordered the two-pack for sale here at Amazon, for a savings of about 25 percent per bottle compared to my local Walmart, roughly 40 percent less than at Walgreen's.  The bottles were shrink-wrapped together, put in a clear protective bag, and then boxed with air bladders--flawless.  I am sorry some reviewers here had problems with different versions of Zeabsorb than they bargained for, or poor packaging; hopefully those problems have been addressed.  Certainly I am pleased with my experience.  Also, thus far, this is NOT an add-on item, a plus with me.If you haven't tried Zeabsorb AF yet, I recommend it, but I do realize the choice of an antifungal powder like this is somewhat subjective.  Personally, I know of no good substitute for the powder for personal use, and the price at Amazon as of now can't be beat.  Five stars!
B000052WWV These is excellent powder and have come in very handy and was delivered on time as stated in very good shape with no defects.
B000052WWV I've had several issues with my skin, and this product has worked better than all of the other over-the-counter and prescription products I've tried. I have this on subscribe and save now. I use it in conjunction with the PediFix FungaSoap.
B000052WWV I love to running, but don't want a toenail infection or fungus. I use this between changing out my odor eaters especially in the summer and I have never had a problem.
B000052WWV Nice and absorbentDoes not smell badFeels nice on skin, nice as can use for any skin site on the nody
B000052WWV I have chronic athletes foot since I was a kid. I put this in my shoes before I do anything especially when I exercise. Its expensive but it is worth it.
B000052WWV I worked at ups for many years, and wearing the same workboots everyday isnt so great when your feet sweat.  I have since left ups and can afford to alternate what shoes I wear everyday to work.  My feet still sweat, but ordinary foot powders didnt help remove athletes foot.  I read reviews on this, and bought a 2 pack here on amazon.  Within a week or two, my athletes foot completely disappeared and the skin on my feet looks and feels wonderful.  No more tingling, no dry cracked skin.Pros: best antifungal foot powder I have used.  I tried a vast mix of products from drugstores and none had the lasting effect of this one.  I have run through my two bottles and am hesitant to switch to the regular zeasorb. Its not much cheaper, but with the rate I go through these bottles, the 2$ price difference helps.Cons: The price.  I used to get generic foot powders for $1.  They helped with foot sweating problems, but didnt cure athletes foot.  For the price of this, I put it directly on my feet but I cant justify coating the inside of my shoes with this.  I still use my generic powders I have on hand to put in my shoes after wearing.  This cured my athletes foot problems, but doesnt help so much with moisture.  I still switch socks midday.Great product I will continue to use until I manage to find one that deals with moisture better.
B000052WWV Several years ago my dermatologist recommended Zeasorb and I have been using it ever since.  It has become more a necessity now due to my weight gain following radiation and chemo treatment for late-stage cancer.  The powder is helpful in keeping the moist areas of my skin as dry as possible and free from itch.  The 2.5 oz. size being sold now is probably as a result of TSA's size requirements.  I was used to buying the 11.5 oz. size in the past.  The 2.5 oz. size is more convenient for travel.
B000052WWV The only reason I am giving this 4 stars is because the product label is misleading.  It's just not for athlete's foot, it's also good for jock itch.  My derm told me that there's no difference between this powder and the one that's labeled &#34;jock itch&#34;.  It's deceiving because the prices are different, whether intentionally or not, it does not matter, consumers shouldn't have to deal with the confusion.  This product gets the job done quickly and easily.  I can't find a better medical powder out there.
B000052WWV The answer to your problem especially in you live in a humid climate!  Powder really works, no strong odor.  Well worth the $.
B000052WWV All zeasorbs are the same.  This brand is cheaper than the one that cvs sells - not sure in comparison to walmart
B000052WWV Was recommending by Dr, i put it in my shoes as often as i can remember and seems to work very well.
B000052WWV You see results almost immediately with this product.  I'm very happy with it, and I highly recommend it to others.
B000052WWV This product works.  Used 2x daily to clear up rash and keep the skin dry, and problem solved.  It works better than any cream or ointment I've tried.  Highly recommend, particularly if you've tried other remedies without success.
B000052WWV If you're an athlete, this is great for putting between the toes to keep away athlete's foot.If you're a plus-size person, this is great for dusting those areas with bits of skin that touch (where things can otherwise get sweaty, especially in humid weather)-- to keep away fungal infections.Zeasorb is a corn-starch based powder.  Unlike talc, I understand corn starch is easier on your skin.  While I understand they also make a product without fungus-killer Miconazole Nitrate 2%, I like this one because it keeps the fungus away.Only thing is, you might want to alternate them and I am going to try that-- I understand Miconazole Nitrate isn't meant to be used continually.It would also be great if these products were easier to apply.  I've never liked the whole \"shake things into your hand and tap yourself\" application method.  Can't we move beyond that in the 21st Century?It's pretty basic, there's no real scent, which is how I like it, and it does the job well.  Try it!And consider the \"subscribe and save\" option, which is a winner in my book.
B000052WWV I have a lot of trouble with jock itch and hate the spray on powders.  I don't know why anyone would want to use them.  Tinactin and Zeasorb are the only ones I use.
B000052WWV This powder is a must for me. It keeps me dry and feeling fresh and clean. Being a larger woman we need to keep those areas that tend to be a bit moist (IE: under my breasts) dry and rash free ... this product does just that!  In fact, it clears a rash in a day or so.
B000052WWV I used this powder after every shower on certain parts of my body. Works great. My doctor told me to use it and it works great.
B000052WWV This works for many  reasons so you can't go wrong.  Use for feet and many others parts of the body that need to be kept dry.  This small container lasts a long time due to the very fine powder.
B000052WWV Dermatologist recommended this but it is kind of pricey.  So it was great to find it a little bit cheaper with the add-on free shipping.
B000052WWV Really works. Nothing else on market like this. No strong smell no burning. Just works the way it is supposed to
B000052WWV I'm very athletic so I started using this product to prevent heat rashes on my private parts and my inner thighs which were occuring often. This product works very well. I use it daily for preventative care.
B000052WWV I cured my very very stubborn jock itch using this and anti fungal cream, I used this because it dries up the skin which helps kill the fungus .
B000052WWV I love this powder. I don't know why I couldn't find this any sooner. I bought these a few months back and I can't tell you enough how this helps me throughout the day and at night. Keeps me dry and comfortable. Definitely will buy again and again.
B000052WWV If you live in a hot, humid area then this is a must have for you. This stops fungal infections from happening - at least it works for our family. We are highly active and live in an area that is sub-tropical. This means we are almost always damp (thanks to the humidity). This powder can be used all over your body and isn't just for feet.
B000052WWV This powder is great for not only feet, but also any spot that gets moist and stays moist in a humid climate.  Ask any athlete who wears work out clothes!  It is much cheaper, and better, than any other brand I have purchased.
B000052X6F I have hot air heating and it dries things out in the winner. Before I started using this product, I would wake up with very dry mucus in my nose, and if I blow my nose the mucus was bloody.I have tried several approach to reduce the dryness.Ayr Gel put inside the nostril before sleep really did the job. I also use Ayr SalineAyr Saline Nasal Mist, 1.69-Ounce Spray Bottles (Pack of 6)during the day if I feel a bit dry.Ayr Gel inside the nostril works better then room humidifiers which did not solve my problem and cleaning them was a lot of work.  I don't have any tingling or any other feeling. It has no odor.  My nose just feels moist and fresh. It is also reasonably priced compared to other products.Ali Julia review
B000052X6F After 8 months with a sinus infection that had seemed to have turned my nose a permanent shade of red, my doctor recommended this over-the-counter cream and my red nose (and sinus infection, with the help of antibiotics) are gone!
B000052X6F This stuff burns and then you sneeze flinging the gel out of your nose. The best thing is just to pack vaseline up your nose.
B000052X6F Very good product would recommend just ordering with Christmas rush all types of packages in the mail. My order came in a envelope manila that is with small boxes of gel inside. Two boxes were crushed on one side. Took the other two out and cleaned them up. Contacted Ayr and they wanted pictures of crushed boxes that were in the trash. They stated in a email that they were sorry and would replace ASAP. HAS BEEN OVER TWO WEEKS AGO. They know Amazon is reading there response so they make it look great in guess. Would NOT ORDER FROM THEM AGAIN.
B000052X6F my dr.gave free samples because of crust and sores in my nose from oxygen use,this is great no more sore's or crust,best of all no more pain.
B000052X6F I have chronic anemia and am periodically on oxygen, and have developed nearly daily nosebleeds. My hematologist gave me a sample of Ayr because I was in so much pain from the cracking and irritation, I could hardly touch my nose. After a few days using it, my nostrils were actually *flexible* without being too painful again! I still get nosebleeds but if I keep up with using the Ayr as needed, I don't have the burning dryness, it doesn't hurt to touch the sides of my nose and I can blow my nose (believe me, that's an achievement).I purchased theAyr Saline Nasal Gel Moisturizing Swabs With Soothing Aloe, 20-Count Swabsto tuck in my purse when I'm out, since this is Wisconsin and it's drier than a bone here in the winter.This is better than the entire pile of saline-only mists, treatments and sprays I've been advised to use.
B000052X6F I am a disabled patient on 24/7 oxygen and use CPAP at night.  Also on multiple medications.  This leads to congestion and dry nasal/sinuspassages.  Ayr helps relieve such issues.  Recommend to anyone.
B000052X6F As my husband and I have gotten older we have had increasing nasal dryness during the winter.  For a few years we have been using Boroleum at bedtime.  The Boroleum is quite helpful -- but it is viscous and smells awful.  It is basically petrolatum and camphor.  Really do not want to be using it during the day.  My husband discovered this Ayr saline nasal gel -- it is very light, liquid, and unscented.  We find we need to use it several times a day but it has become indispensable.  If I forget to reapply it my nose quickly becomes dry and painful.  It almost doesn't seem possible that this simple and inexpensive salve could work so well.  We have bought so many tubes of this and it is now one of our subscribe and save items.  We are always stocking several tubes as we never want to run out of it.
B000052X6F I suffer from a very dry nose because of mess I'm taking. This really helps moisten things up. I've used it for about a month and the swelling inside has gone down and I can use it several times a day. At night  I use something  with sesame oil which lasts longer. I would recommend this product.
B000052X6F Both my daughter and I have a problem with dry noses and use this product, often multiple times a day, especially in winter.  We keep tubes around the house and in the cars.  The product is very soothing and last much longer than sprays, including Ayr spray.  Highly recommended.
B000052X6F It's winter. That means my nostrils dry up, even with a humidifier running.I apply Ayr Saline Nasal Gel several times a day and my problem with \"dryness\" is resolved.I've been using it for a couple of weeks now since the actual onset of our Chicago winter and am pleased with the relief it provides. My nostrils aren't dry and I don't have any crusts or the other ugly things that happen with wintry dry noses.This is great stuff.Jerry
B000052X6F This works to help moisterize your nose but it contains 2 types of parabens which are bad for you and possibly cause cancer I'm not even sure why these are needed since the only main ingreidtant is aloe and water. One might just use aloe juice. There are other things you can use in place of this and they might be better off than putting parabens in your nose.
B000052X6F I live in Arizona where everything is dried out and most people here have trouble with nose bleeds.  Since I am on warfarin, this has caused problems for me with an excessive nosebleed.  Now I use this in my nostrils about six times a day.
B000052X6F This was a multi-box deal. The expiration was far enough away in years that I will easily use them all. I suffer from dry bleeding sinuses in the winter. My doctor recommended vasaline; that was a one time nightmare. I tried a generic of this from CVS and liked it, and then found this product for less than the generic. It helps ease the pain of dry nasal passages, help stop the nasal prescription spray from giving me nose bleeds, and coupled with netti pot, saline rinse, and two vaporizers, my nose has been happy and sinus infection free for two months. I will buy more for sure!
B000052X6F I use this stuff 2 times a day and it seems to keep away the nose bleeds. Much cheaper than buying a whole house humidifier. ($2000).
