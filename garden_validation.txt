B00002N674 Good USA company that stands behind their products. I have had to warranty two hoses and they send replacements right out to you. I had one burst after awhile, you could see it buldge for weeks before it went so no suprises. The other one was winter related as I am bad and leave them out most of the time. Highly reccomend. Note the hundred footer is heavy and like wresting an anaconda when its time to put away, but it does have a far reach.
B00002N674 This is a high quality 8 ply hose. I have had good luck with Gilmour hoses in the past. A good choice in hoses.
B00002N674 It's probably one of the best hoses I've ever had.Pro's:- It's good enough for most front yards, or small back yards.- It has enough flow (and with the right head) to water plants 25ft away from the nozzle, and water your garden.- It's light weight, and flexible (it does not pose as much of a problem unrolling this hose with kinks as with other hoses I've owned)- The hose is flexible, yet strong. I haven't cut the outside yet.- This hose has been in full sunlight for more than 3 months, and the rubber hasn't cracked yet! I believe it's good quality rubber.cons:- Like with every hose, keeping it outside in the sunshine, the water warms up and starts smelling.My dog don't want to drink from the water coming from this hose.- The hose is only in one color (I wished it was a little less visible in the gardenOtherwise this hose is an excellent garden tool!I bought 2 of them, one 25ft for my front garden, and 50ft for my rear garden.3-4months and still in excellent condition!
B00002N674 I probably should have bought something a bit more flexible and less rugged since I constantly coil/uncoil it for washing cars, but that's my fault not a product fault.
B00002N674 I bought three of these 5/8-inch Flexogen hoses--50, 75, and 100 feet--for different areas of yard around the house.  After a season of use they've proven to be good hoses.  Of course, it's very favorable that they don't leak.  But what particularly impresses me about them is their notably light weight and flexibility, which make them a lot easier to handle than my previous hoses.  The flexibility diminishes in cold weather, but a garden hose is less useful then anyway.They're not especially prone to kinking, but they're not kink-proof, either, nor do they claim to be.  They kink a lot less than one of my old hoses and more than a couple of others, but the latter were fairly stiff, so there was a trade-off.Bottom line:  this was a good purchase.
B00002N674 I aqm impressed with the cost and quality of this product, Also impressed on the fast shipment by Amazon as I received it in 4 days, Has not kinked and a great hose as I had one before which I left in the yard during all seasons and even ran across driveway, But it lasted 5 good years through all the abuse,  I would recommend this to anyone, Thanks
B00002N67P After using this hose I will never go back to small diameter garden hoses.  The water flows with much more force, which is especially useful when using the jet nozzle.  Most garden hoses are only 1/2\" diameter, and some premium hoses are 5/8\", but this is 3/4\".There is a significant water pressure loss with regular hoses because the smaller diameter means that more of the water is in contact with the walls, plus it flows at higher velocity further increasing the friction.  You'd be amazed looking at the charts, just how much pressure is lost with the cheap standard hoses.  For example:I'm looking at a plastic pipe friction head loss chart.  At 5 gallons per minute, the pressure friction head loss per 100 ft is 5.3 ft for a 3/4\" pipe (same size as this hose).  For a 1/2\" (regular hose size) pipe the head loss is 20.7 ft - that's 4x less height that the water can travel merely because of friction from the smaller inside diameter!I also noticed, this hose also has less tendency to kink.
B00002N67P This is one tough hose and it is thick and stiff.The connections are strong and the hose is industrial strength.I bought this to use with my pressure washer because it is 8 ply and 3/4 inch wide.My old hose was just rubber and it was flexing and twisting and there is no way this hose is going to do that.The hose is warrantied for life and unless there is a problem with a leak i don't think i will ever need to use it.The local big box stores do not sell a 3/4 50 foot hose and my pressure washer will not operate with anything longer than 50 feet.The price and delivery were great and Amazon is the best around if there is ever a concern.
B00002N67P I'll buy more of these come  Spring. Holding up very well to the extreme heat and cold of Idaho.  A bit on the heavy side, but that is what makes them last so well.
B00002N67P So far so good! I have not really had the time to test out the hose as it is cold weather time right now. I bought this Gilmour hose based on all the recommendations. I am looking forward to not having to wrestle the hose to use it.
B00002N67P Hey Gilmore I have been buying your hoses for years and only your hoses. You stand behind your product and provide great customer support..  But I am only giving you 4 stars  because this hose and the 100 footer I bought  a few months back seem to kink more than my older Flexogens not sure why ?
B00002N67Q This is a good quality hose that I use to connect to my &#34;Scarecrow&#34; so as to keep the deer away from my plants. It sits in the sun all day long and so far shows no sign of degradation.
B00002N67Q I bought a cheap hose that didn't hold the pressure after 2 days.  This bad boy hold the pressure and doesn't leak.  Its not even expanding.  Great quality hose.  I will be keeping them in mind when I need more length.
B00002N67Q I was worried about getting a short one, but this serves my need just fine, as it accompanied by a longer and more troublesome one.  I leave the sprinkler on it instead of switching heads - so much easier.  slightly stiff to lay out, but if it weren't, I am sure it would kink.  I got it with the gilmore brass 2-way hose connector - an excellent pair for me
B00002N67Q For everything I need for my lawn and garden work I try to find a Gilmour product.  They just can't be beat for the price and/or guarantee.  This hose is typical of a Gilmour item.  It is a strong and supple hose and like most other Gilmour products, comes with a lifetime guarantee.  I have cut hoses with my mower and they still replace them.  Quite a company!
B00002N67Q It's been outside in the hot (South Florida) sunshine 24/7, and still flexible. No crackles, and remains in great shape!A real bargain!
B00002N67Q I've always been one of those people that bought the cheapest kind of hose whenever I needed one.  I don't do much in the way of gardening, nor wash my car that often.  So investing in a really good quality hose didn't make that sense to me.  The only flaw in that logic is cheap hoses have a habit of breaking and leaking just sitting there on the reel, whether you use them or not.  So in the long run you don't save much.  That, and the fact that cheap hoses also make you feel like you are wrestling a snake when using them for they are so stiff and kink like crazy.  When I decided to buy a better hose I came across this one and liked it immediately.  It's very well made and just about as flexible a hose you can buy without going for one of those new fangled shrinking hoses.  (I'm not sold on the long term quality of those).  This thing is a pleasure to use, as well as making it much simpler a task of rolling it up when you're done.  It kinda reminds me of what my cheap hose felt like when it was sitting out stretched in the sun for a while.  It would feel much softer and more flexible.  Something this does with or without sun.  Though its true that getting that flexibility carries with it a little more weight in the hose itself, its such a pleasure to use that I feel the trade off is well worth it.  It only takes a short time to get used to it being a little heavier anyway, and I love being able to roll it up on the reel when done so easily.  A top notch hose that carries a generous amount of quality, convenience, all for a fair price that I highly recommend... : )
B00002N67Q I've been in the Landscape Industry for over 60 years and have owned my own company for 23 years. One of the odder phenomenons I've experienced is that client's will spend $1,000 on a garden sculpture or $100 for a bottle of wine for a garden party but then they turn into Scrooge McDuck when it comes to sinking ANY SUM OF MONEY into the items required to properly care for the garden!Gimmicks abound in any industry but it seems that in the Green Industry, a Fool and Their Money is Guaranteed to Be Parted! Curly hoses, shrinky hoses, pink & purple hoses...the very item that delivers Life Giving Water is dismissed and ignored and people insist on spending the LEAST amount of money on a hose. Aside from the very important matter of a hose needing double walls to withstand the constant P.S.I. (pounds per square inch), a good hose also needs to have solid brass couplings, and have enough plys to avoid kinking.THIS hose delivers! Yes, there is heft to it's weight...that's what you NEED from a quality hose! And, it refuses to kink, even when you try to kink it as a test. I've bought Gilmour hoses for clients and my own company's use for over 17 years and NEVER needed to replace a single one! The 25 foot length is excellent to extend a longer hose for occasional use, rather than dragging that extra length around your property 24/7. Also, for very small Urban Gardens, rarely do you need more than 15 feet of hose so the 25' length is perfect for city gardens or roof top decks.Here are some tips from someone that works for a living with garden hoses:1) Use a cheap rope that you pick up at the Dollar Store to get the MAXIMUM LENGTH of hose you need. Mark that length down. Then, using the same rope, measure the NORMAL LENGTH that you will need on a daily/weekly basis. If the difference is more than 10 feet, BUY TWO OR MORE HOSES! Yes, I know that sounds insane but hear me out.If on a daily basis, you only need a 50' hose to reach your 40' garden, WHY are you buying a 100' hose to drag around? If you only need that additional 25 or 50 feet for the few times you wash your car or windows or fill a pool, buy some quick-connects and the extention hose length that you'll only use rarely. Hoses come in 10', 25', 50', 75', 100' and 150' length; ONLY buy the shortest length you need 90% of the time and then an additional hose to attach when needed.2) To coil your hose easily whether you store it on the ground or on a hose wheel, turn OFF THE WATER and keep the nozzle OPEN to drain the pounds and pounds of water that are trapped inside the hose! If you hate getting dirty hands, use garden gloves to coil it up and using the natural curl of the hose, just continue to coil it, turning the hose as needed.3) During the Summer, attach a PLASTIC SHUT OFF VALVE to both ends of the hose: the one connected to your home's spigot and also to the nozzle of choice. WHY? Because plastic does NOT corrode like any metal will do and if you have high minerals in your water, there are times that the hose coupling will actually become permanently corroded to the spigot or nozzle, making it completely impossible to remove! I know that we're taught that Metal=Good and Plastic=Bad but trust me...when I have to tell a client that they either need to replace a $70 hose or hire a plumber to remove a sealed/corroded coupling, that $2 dollar plastic gate valve becomes priceless!4) ALWAYS DRAIN YOUR HOSE, DETACH THE GATE VALVES AND STORE YOUR HOSE, VALVES AND NOZZLE IN A FREEZE-PROOF AREA!!! If I don't do it for my client's and trust them to do it, it never gets done. And after the first hard frost, trapped water in nozzles, hoses and valves expands and can destroy all of the above in one night. It takes less than 30 minutes to winterize two hoses and attachments; figure out the cost of replacing everything in Spring when you find them all destroyed!5) One of the best ways to RUIN ANY HOSE, is to tug-tug-tug at the coupling, which breaks the weld and suddenly you have a leak that can't be fixed! I simply make a small loop in the end that attachs to the house which acts as a \"brake\" and takes the pressure off of the coupling and spigot.I only recommend landscape items that I trust to use with all my employees and on all my jobs. When I gain new clients, I teach them the benefits of a good hose and order it for them, never having to do it again. Buy one less bottle of good wine and use that cash for your hose. You won't be sorry! :)
B00002N67Q This little hose was purchased to add on to my other 50 foot hose due to the very humid and oppressive weather this last month in the Northeast.  It is very flexible and easy to handle and allows me total reach of the back perennial garden.  i would recommend this hose
B00002N68C There is only one thing wrong with this design:  the spray shape and the water volume can not be controlled independently. Better designs have one control for open-closed and another for spray shape. That makes this nozzle useless for filling buckets and other close applications. It is impossible to get high volume at low pressure output.That said, the simple design is almost bomb-proof and the price is fair.
B00002N68C This is definitely a good quality nozzle. It is similar to the &#34;old fashioned&#34; type nozzle we had as kids. It gives differing spray patterns depending on how far you squeeze the trigger.
B00002N68C It looks like it came right out of an episode of Leave It To Beaver but don't be fooled by this retro-looking nozzle. This feels great in my hand and functions way better than the plethora of nozzles I have tried in the past. The trigger has a real nice, snappy, feel to it.Unlike my other nozzles that are made from plastic, I actually think this will survive a winter outdoors in PA. The only thing I have to get used to is that the type of spray is determined by the pressure I apply on the trigger. Everything else about it is perfect.
B00002N68C I am very happy that I bought this nozzle. It is exactly what I wanted. Good quality and I highly recommend it. I really need it too.
B00002N68C I have bought many types of nozzle over the years and this old timer which I used to use when I was growing up served me well this past season.
B00002N68C This is a nice hose nozzle - simple design, sturdily made and inexpensive. It can go from high-powered jet mode to gently spray just by loosening your grip. It also doesn't leak at all where it attaches to the hose!My only gripe would be that when you use the widest spray pattern, it can come out unevenly &#8211;e.g., it's not an even &#34;circle&#34; of water coming out, which makes watering evenly a little challenging. But it's not a big deal.Get one, you'll like it.
B00002N68C Nozzles exactly like this have been around for at least 40 years--manufactured in a dozen companies--and sold under a wide variety of brand names---for a very good reason---they are the best design.  They are perfectly and easily controllable, durable, and don't leak.  You can get \"prettier\" versions with plastic covers over the grip and plastic handles, if \"pretty\" is your priority---but, functionally speaking, you can't buy a better designed garden hose nozzle.THUMB SCREWNote the little thumb screw at the end of the piston can be used to adjust the type of spray when the handle is maximally squeezed.  If you wish, you can tighten the screw (you may need pliers to do so, and/or you may need to grease the screw threads) back from full unfocused flow to the tightest stream for long throws---that makes long throws a little easier.LOCK-ON LOOPNotice the small wire loop at top---when the lever is complete depressed, you can rotate the loop back to prevent the lever from closing, and then you can release your grip.  So, this is a \"lock on\" device, which becomes particularly useful when you use the brass screw to adjust to the pattern you want.  For example, if you always want a medium cone spray, you can adjust the sprayer semi-permanently to that setting.NOT A VALVEOne reviewer complains that there is no \"medium\" strength, e.g., for filling buckets.  What do you expect?  The actual \"problem\", as far as that reviewer was concerned, is the nozzle is \"too good\"---it delivers full pressure, at all but the tightest mist setting.  Although it does have a \"closed\" position, this is a nozzle, NOT a valve. If you want a VALVE to reduce the PRESSURE, then install aMelnor 390S Hose Shut-Offor aGilmour Brass Garden Hose Connector With Shut-Off Valve 03Vjust before the nozzle.  Or, close your faucet part way.  Alternatively, to fill a bucket, loosen the thumb screw, then \"open 'er up\" (squeeze the handle all the way)---the result is is maximum unfocused flow, which is perfect for very quickly filling a bucket, etc.COMPLAINTS OF OTHER REVIEWERSMany reviewers (of this and other products) write reviews about different, but similar-looking, products.  Many of the complaints are about sprayers which are NOT \"Gilmour 572TF\".  If you find a sprayer that looks like this in \"bargain bin\" at your local hardware store---it probably is not a \"Gilmour 572TF\", unless the packaging says so.  Sometimes when you order from an Amazon Vendor (rather than Amazon itself)---you don't get exactly the product described.  I'm NOT saying that Gilmour is always the best, but only that THIS review is about the \"Gilmour 572TF\", and other reviewers 1-star reviews MAY not be.CAVEATSHere in the tropics (South Florida)---the year-round heat is hard on all garden tools.  After a year or two, the zinc metal body can seize on your hose and be difficult to unscrew.  I suggest greasing the screw threads with silicon grease when you install it on the hosePermatex 22058 Dielectric Tune-up Grease - 3 oz.If you don't have silicon grease on hand, buy a tube---it terrific for improving electrical connections and refurbishing rubber items, and even for lubricating things such as this.  While you are at it, lubricate all your hose connections (both the threads and the seals) to prevent leaking and to make it easy to screw-on and -off the hoses and accessories.Why not petroleum-based grease?  Petroleum-based grease damages rubber seals.  However even petroleum grease is better than no grease (besides most hose gaskets are now plastic, not rubber)After 2 or 3 years of abuse the action can get begin to get stiff, presumably caused by internal corrosion (or the original grease having deteriorated or lost).  The handle (the lever in back) is steel, and can rust.  Ultimately the stiffness plus the rust results in the handle breaking (after 5 years or so of abuse).  Ideally, keep the nozzle dry---at least don't keep it in a muddy puddle, or half-buried in acidic soil.  It is good idea to lubricate the piston with grease when you start to notice it getting stiff. (With the water off, squeeze the handle to expose the brass rod.  Apply a liberal amount of grease to the piston).  If the nozzle is very stiff, take it off the hose, spray it heavily with WD-40, let it soak for 15 minutes or so---that will probably adequately loosen it up, but is not a permanent solution---you still need to grease it.But those are the extremes---reasonably well taken care of (or at least not abused) a nozzle can last 10 years or more.ALTERNATIVES> Folks with arthritis or weak grips may be happier with traditional brass nozzles, such asDramm 12380 Heavy-Duty Brass Adjustable Hose Nozzle.  These are virtually indestructible, and hold any particular spray pattern until you change it.> Those \"prettier\" versions of the zinc nozzle with plastic handles I mentioned may be more pleasant to use in the winter, and might get the wife's approval.  Often these are only 50 cents or so more than the 573TF, and in that case are clearly better choices.Gilmour 572TFR Commercial Insulated Grip Nozzle with Threaded Front, Red,Gilmour Comfort Grip Nozzle with Threaded Front 593 Black,Gilmour 572 Insulated Pistol Grip Nozzle.> High quality all plastic versions are available for use around salt water.Gilmour Salt Water and Marine Nozzle 474S> There are cheap plastic versions you can get for $1--$2 in \"bargain bins\", which are a good deal for the price, but are not nearly as durable, and through an Amazon vendor when you add shipping your total cost is the same as a zinc or high quality plastic sprayer.> There are versions with spray-pattern or nozzle heads on the front---but that sabotages the virtues of the basic design, reducing the sprayer body into a mere valve.  You'd be better off with a brass nozzle sprayer mentioned above.  I find constantly having to rotate the head to select the 1 or 2 spray patterns I use to be very annoying.  For example (not recommended)Gilmour Pistol Grip Nozzle 327 Teal/Red> If you (or your wife) insists on a \"pretty\" nozzle with s electable spray patterns, I suggest the hybridGilmour Select-A-Spray Comfort Grip Nozzle 594 Black/Tealor Gilmour Select-A-Spray Metal Nozzle 584.  One setting is the full-action, and there are several selectable patterns.NERD CORNERThe zinc body corrodes through electrolytic action.  I.e., the zinc will \"sacrifice\" itself (and corrode) to protect iron or any other metal of lower electrolytic potential which it is touching, or with which it is sharing a conducting solution (such as a water-saturated acidic soil), or salt-water .  So try to keep it dry and away from unpainted, ungalvanized steel, or salt water.  (Galvanized steel is iron coated with zinc for this very purpose, to prevent the iron from rusting--not as a barrier like paint, but rather by electrolytic action).What about those other pretty, fancy, mostly plastic sprayer nozzles (which cost 3x--4x more) that you see at the garden center?---they don't work nearly as well, and won't last nearly as long.  I know this for a fact---my wife keeps buying them---indeed we have a bin of discarded (mostly still functional) \"pretty\" sprayer nozzles, which have \"fallen out of favor\" for various reasons.
B00002N68C I've tried all sorts of nozzles for my hose and they either break, get stuck on the end of the hose, or don't have enough power to really blast things with water. This nozzle is durable, easy to remove, and super strong!
B00002N68C metal too soft, its all wore out after light use, the thread on front already smooth out.lots rust on the back puller/handle part, need something with better material, rather buy once and be done with it for many year.
B00002N6AN I've always bought cheap sprinklers that would ineffectively water the lawn and me, too. It killed me to spend so much on a sprinkler, but I've probably sunk so much on junk sprinklers in the past 10 years and bit the bullet after reading the reviews for the Raintrain. Convenience alone makes this sprinkler really attractive, but it does a good job and that is a real draw.Operation is easy. Extend the garden hose where you want to water as the hose is the 'track' that the Raintrain runs on. By adjusting the time and the pressure you essentially control where you water and the degree of water used. Then sit back and enjoy as  the Raintree does the work.  No more moving the sprinkler or possibly getting showered. It doesn't get much simpler.The spray is low and slow so everything gets watered more effectively and there is less evaporation. My lawn really looks better than it had when I used my old sprinkler.I use this in my garden  and it does a good job keeping all my perennials and herbs staying healthy and lush.This sprinkler is well made and worth the higher than average price.
B00002N6AN There are some positive features about the Nelson Raintree Traveling Sprinkler that makes is an excellent sprinkler, and a good one to have if one has a large lawn. It's definitely sturdily built, and with a steel body, it appears nearly indestructible. Because it's a &#34;traveling&#34; sprinkler, once you have it set and have placed the hose in the middle of the track you want it to cover, it will move on its own and give a wide area of lawn a thorough sprinkling. One doesn't have to run out every little while to move the sprinkler so that it can water another patch of ground. Also, there's a little ramp you can run the hose through so that when the sprinkler has completed its intended course it reaches the ramp and shuts off on its own. This is particularly useful if you're not going to be around to monitor it.Now, a couple less positive features. First, this is an appropriate sprinkler only for those parts of the lawn that are relatively wide open and devoid of obstacles. We have a number of large trees in both our front and back yards. Also, we have tree rings and the like, which mean that parts of our lawn are isolated from the rest. We need a second sprinkler to cover these parts. So, buy this only if you have a large enough amount of open space to make having one worthwhile.Second, it is a very heavy sprinkler. I realize that this is the price one pays for a large metal object. But if you want a light-weight piece of equipment, this isn't it.
B00002N6AN I've had my Raintrain for a little over a year now.  I was initially very enthusiastic about it, but over time, I grew less satisfied with it.Pros:>For some reason, it's mesmerizing to watch.  After I get it set up, I always watch for a few moments to make sure the water throw is adjusted properly, and then I find myself watching it longer than necessary.  There's just something cool and relaxing about how the arms spin and the wheels turn and how it slowly moves along.  From talking to some other people who own this and similar products, \"sprinkler watching\" seems to be a common phenomenon.>The coarse spray is ideal for use in windy areas.  You'll get a lot less drift and evaporation using this than you would with a finer-droplet sprinkler.>The adjustability is impressive.  I have a long, 4-foot swatch of grass that would be difficult to water with most other sprinklers, but on the Raintrain, I can point the arms way down and keep the water where I want it.  But I can also point the arms way up and throw the water for at least 50 feet.>It's quiet.  The only sound it makes is the water hitting the grass.>The shut-off feature is very handy and worked quite well (initially).>It stands up well to neglect.  I left both my sprinkler and the stop block sitting outside in the sun and snow all winter, and come spring, they seemed no worse for wear.  Also, you are supposed to disconnect the sprinkler and let it drain after each use, and I've never done that, with no apparent effect yet.Cons:>This thing is really heavy, as it needs to be, but when you're hauling it out to the north forty (okay, the back of a 6500-square-foot lawn), it's a little cumbersome.>The hose connection is awkwardly placed.  It's in the somewhat narrow space at the back between the wheels, so I find it a little difficult to get a good grip on the connector.  There are also two inexplicable protrusions in the body of the sprinkler right next to the connector, and this makes it even harder to grip.  This is why I never drain my sprinkler like I'm supposed to; I hate connecting it.>The connector always leaks, even after I put in a gasket, and the hose sometimes loosens while it's traveling.>Getting the water to throw just the right distance is a pain.  You have to turn on the water, see where it's throwing, turn it off, walk out to the sprinkler, adjust the arms, walk back to the faucet, turn it on, see if that's right, and then repeat until you have it where you want it, which might involve several tries.>The water is thrown in a circle, but only to the outside of the circle.  This is easily seen if you have the sprinkler set where it will be thrown on concrete.  You can see the arc of the circle and the dry area inside it.  The way the Raintrain gets all the ground covered is by advancing this outline through the yard.  For this reason, the stationary setting on the sprinkler is useless.  It will water the outline of the circle only.>Because of the circle outline problem, the area at the beginning and end of the course will get half as much water as the rest of the yard (the beginning of the course will only be hit by the trailing edge of the circle, and the end of the course will only be hit by the front edge).  To compensate for this, I turn off the water, pick up the Raintrain, and move it back at both the beginning and end so that the areas get covered by the half circle twice.  This creates a lot of extra work for what I was hoping would be a labor-saver.>I found that the Raintrain doesn't deliver nearly as much water as it says it will.  The farther you throw the water, the less depth of water you'll put out (because the same amount of water is being spread out over a bigger area), but when I had the arms adjusted for a pretty narrow path, I only measured about a quarter inch of water (even on \"low gear,\" which makes it travel more slowly).  This likely explains why I've struggled so much with keeping my lawn green since I got the Raintrain.  With stationary sprinklers, you can leave them running as long as necessary to achieve the water delivery you need.  But with the Raintrain, if you need more water than it delivers, your only option is to lay out the hose again and start it over, which is a lot of extra work.>While the sprinkler se
B00002N6AN This looks like it will be a great piece of equipment.  I've used it a couple of times so far and have been impressed.  The only problem is if it hits a soft area of the yard, the wheels can sink in and it gets stuck.  You certainly can't just set it and forget it.  It needs to be babysat every half hour or so to ensure it is still moving.
B00002N6AN This sprinkler seemed to be a perfect fit for what I needed but unfortunately I had to return it.I have about 4500 square feet of grass including backyard and my yard is someone weird shaped, so I figured this sprinkler would work well for me.My first complain is its very slow so I am unable to track how much water this is really consuming. I am a college student and stay at home dad, I don't have the money for a high water bill.Second complain is that's it a heavy piece of metal and I don't understand why it needs to be so heavy. I don't mind lifting weights but I don't wanna lift while I'm working in my grass, this is an expensive sprinkler and I'm not leaving it outside at night so carrying this inside every night is somewhat of a hassle.Pros- I like the coverage it gets, it covers a lot of space and it left me having to only use it a few feet of hose.Setup was pretty simple, I can recall a few times adjusting the sprayers and running off getting my pants soaked lolOverall I give it a B- I think you should just stick with your regular sprinkler, save yourself the hassle and skip this purchase
B00002N6AN I remember my dad using a sprinkler like this when I was a kid (I'm 61).  We are in the middle of a drought here in Texas and I was tired of having to move the sprinkler and thought this would solve my problem.  First of all, this is a VERY heavy sprinkler and is awkward to pick up and move.  If you have any trouble lifting heavy objects, get something else.  It has to be moved.  You can't drag it and you can't turn it around and make it go the other direction.  I have found I have to check on it as often, if not more often, than I was moving my oscillating sprinkler.  First, it jumped off the hose/track and was climbing the fence.  Then, it kinked the hose and cut off the water.  Finally, it dug itself a hole and had mud all over the back wheels.  Tried it another time and it just stopped spraying water.  No kink this time, checked the button on the bottom, couldn't get it going again.  I went back to my oscillating sprinkler.  At least it's easy to move around.  I think you need to use this on a very flat, very straight lawn.  Mine is bumpy and I need it to make a couple of gentle curves.  It didn't work for me.  I like the spray it puts out and would use it as a stationery sprinkler if it weren't so heavy to move.
B00002N6AN After hearing so much about this unit, and seeing a couple of them in my neighborhood, I decided to give it a try, even though the price was higher than I ever expected to pay for a lawn sprinkler.I now know why so many  people like it.  It is very effective in watering the lawn, without  spraying water high up in the air (less chance for evaporation, and not  affected by wind as much), and it has hands-off operation once you set it  up.Adjusting the spray diameter is easy, and using the hose as a way to  set the travel path for the sprinkler to follow is a great idea.  The  adjustable speed allows you to decide how much water to apply and how much  ground you want to cover in a period of time.Inspecting the yard  afterwards shows that the ground is nicely saturated, and not needing to go  out and move hoses is a welcomed change. This sprinkler is worth the  purchase price!
B00002N6AN Update/Tip: The way our yard is this shoots too large of a swath so I went to Lowes and got a 3 foot piece of 1/2 inch aluminum pipe and made some new arms. I can now get as small as about 2 1/2 feet to around 40 feet. What's cool is that they can be adjusted or I can use combination of any of the arms. For instance, I will use one of the original with one of my new ones. The new one will get the center which the originals don't do that well. I drilled 1/16 inch holes which are plenty large enough. See my photos for a better idea.----------------------------------------------------------Unfortunately it's a little early for us to be watering here in the NW. In fact, we don't always need to water except we set a record last year for something like 80 days straight with no rain. But even in July and August the rain is limited so to keep things green and the garden growing we need to water. Sprinkler systems being too expensive for how often we use them sprinklers like this can be a time saver if they work.I tried it out and it did work. I found I could get down to about a 5 foot width by turning the heads down. But you are limited how far to turn them down or they will hit the tractor.The sprinkler heads need to point a certain direction or it will go backwards...I thought high speed was perfect for my needs. Fast enough I watched it travel 5 feet for my test and it shut off as expected.It does look cool and is fun to watch!Over having to move a sprinkler this really is awesome and compared to a sprinkler system the cost is great. I didn't open it up but if it does indeed have plastic gears how long will it last? As often as I will need it here it may last me a long time. Hopefully a decent investment.
B00002N6AN I own a yard where either the person who planted the trees or the one who ran the irrigation pipes needed a few more lessons about what happens ten years later when that 6' tree becomes a 25 footer and the roots are wrapped around the pipe that was laid 12\" away from it.Because of a variety of issues from shallow topsoil with an uneven granite underlay to existing water/sewer/power lines to heavy tree and root growth, new pipes just aren't in the cards.  Every year I turn on the sprinkler system and start fixing busted pipes and sprinkler heads that have been pushed off by a root.  I've been very lucky so far, I've been able to repair all but one of them.  Once I found myself up to my armpit in a hole not much bigger than my arm, through dense roots where I managed to glue a new pipe piece in.Clearly this sort of stuff takes a lot of time to fix sometimes, and in the meanwhile hand watering my half acre in 100 degree, 0% humidity summers is just a no-go.Enter the Rain Train, because its time to make it rain! :)You lay out a hose path for this, no sharp turns, and only on grass not on pavement or any other type of surface as this may destroy the gears in the unit.  Place the little yellow plastic ramp over the hose where you want it to stop, and insert the metal rod in the ground to hold it.  Turn on the water and set to high or low (high goes faster, disperses less water per square inch) and go do something else for a while.  You can adjust the two spray wands to an angle that gives you the desired coverage, then use the faucet to fine tune it.I have a very hilly yard and after hefting this I was concerned it wouldn't make it uphill, but it appears to move at the same speed regardless of the terrain.  On high you have to stare hard at the wheel spokes for a bit before you can detect movement.  How this works is water comes from the hose into the rear of the unit, then through the two wands which spin, turning a gear that turns the wheels.  Simple and ingenious.I've only had it jump off the hose once, and thats when I made a real hairpin turn to see if it could make it.  Do note that if it jumps the hose it'll go off in some semi-random arc until it runs out of hose.  So while its tempting to set it and go to bed or leave for the day, you might want to check on it once in a while.This is also very handy for those really dry areas where I want to apply a lot of water to a decent sized spot but I dont want to have to remember to keep moving a sprinkler and to turn it off.  This is a nice time and water saver.For those times when I lose a pipe, its also nice to know I have a week or so to fix it and can get the coverage I need from the Rain Train.  This wont ever replace a full sprinkler system, but it'd be fine for watering a really large area that hasn't been fitted with an irrigation system yet, or as I use it for large spot overwatering and temporary irrigation replacement.
B00002N8K3 It's hard writing a review for this Flexogen garden hose because it has a couple big problems, but something else about it makes up for that one problem. Read on:One thing you have to know- pretty much ANY garden hose you buy will tangle if you don't wrap it the right way. However, some hoses it won't matter if you don't do a good job wrapping it. Unfortunately, others (like this one) are sort of cheap and get knotted easily, so you DO have to take the time to wrap it correctly or else the hose will be damaged over time. I guess if you're not the type of person that wraps the hose when you're done with it (and just leave it sit in the yard) none of this will matter. But in my house we have to wrap the hoses.This means, if you drag the hose across the yard, you might have to go back and straighten out the knots because knots WILL most likely happen. And they will happen in three or four different spots on the hose. To me that's a sign of a bad hose. If one knot occurs that's ok. More than one knot and the hose is bad.However, the one thing that makes up for the knot problem is that I've NEVER had a problem with this hose squirting water where it shouldn't. You see, it's hard for me to say whether this Flexogen hose is bad or good. It has problems, but if you can deal with the knot problem you will have a good hose that will last a long time.I'd say using it just to wash your car isn't a bad idea, but dragging the hose across the yard to rinse off things (and water the garden) IS a bad idea because the knots will continue to occur, so you'll have to keep walking all the way back to where the hose begins to straighten it out.  If you think that's not a problem go ahead and get one.
B00002N8K3 I always like this hose, it's reliable, less prone to kink and stand up a lot better than any other garden hoses I ever bought!
B00002N8K3 The Gilmour Flexogen is definitely the best hose I've ever had, and they are made in the USA.  Thanks Gilmour!  Mine stay outdoors year round (we have mild winters with only a few freezes per year, but very long, hot summers). They are very durable and don't kink.  I have never had a reason to take advantage of the lifetime warranty, but other reviewers indicate that Glimour makes good on their promise even decades later.  I've noticed a few negative reviews here where the reviewer is mistakenly commenting on a completely different hose.
B00002N8K3 Short review:  This hose is amazing, Made in the USA, tough as nails yet flexible, will not kink EVER, and I love it.  Buy it now.Longer review:I bought a home depot memorial day special hose for $19.95 (same size as this one) and thought \"how different can hoses be?  this one says kink free.\"  Three months of hose torture ensued, with me trying various tactics (e.g. only moving hose when it's pressurized) to try to keep it from kinking.  That damn endless kink hose is now in a pile in a garage ready for donation.  It has more kinks in it than a Russian porn movie.  Every time I used it I became more and more frustrated and thought longingly of this twice the price hose.Take my advice, buy this hose, it is worth it.  It's also nice to see it's Made in the USA - at least something is.  Amazing warranty. Even in cooler weather it stays flexible.  Great brass fittings.  They are right, this is the last hose I'll ever buy.  Please, Gilmour, don't try to save on cost in the future - keep this hose just the way it is!Hope this helps.  Did I mention I love this hose?
B00002N8K3 I thought I had already reviewed this hose.  We love it!  It is strong and it attaches easily and smoothly to each other (we bought TWO 100' lengths) without leaking.  I expect these hoses to last us a terrifically long time.
B00002N8K3 UPDATE:  Originally, I gave this hose 5 stars but after using them (I bought 3) for a while, I've changed my opinion. Yes, the hoses appear to be well made and are lighter weight than my old professional grade rubber hoses, but Flexogens are still heavy. These Flexogen hoses DO kink, and they kink easily. The only way to reduce the kinking is to completely unroll the entire 100 feet of hose from the reel, lay it flat on the grund, and then turn and turn and turn (twist/rotate) it until it lays completely flat -- make sure there are no \"waves\" or loops. I pulled about 50 feet off the hose reel and, holding the end, walked across my yard. I did not stop to twist out the waves and loops that it formed while unrolling. The hose formed 9 kinks! What a pain in the hand, elbow and shoulder to straighten it! This process wastes time.The second problem is after I screw on my hose wand and turn on the water, this hose becomes unwieldy. The hose turns so that my wand is upside down. It requires a LOT of effort to twist the hose and hold it so the wand sprays downward--requires using both hands. Fighting this hose is painful, very tiring and aggravating.When you rewind it onto a hose reel, the hose twists and turns, causing it to again form waves and loops, which become kinks. Again, you have to twist, rotate, etc. to get all the waves/loops out so the hose lays flat and straight on the ground. As you reel it in, you have to stop and repeat the process. My old commercial-grade hose never did anything like this. You can buy the professional/commercial grade hoses (100 ft) at big box stores and clubs for about $25. Don't buy the Flexogen.Due to age and arthritis in my hands, I needed to replace my heavy, rubber commercial-grade garden hoses with lighter weight, easier-to-maneuver hoses. I was barely able to wind the old rubber hoses on the hose reel or drag them around the yard. After reading reviews on Amazon and other places for garden hoses, I chose this hose. I'm glad I did. While it's still heavy, it weighs considerably less than my commercial-grade rubber hose. It's easier to wind on the reel and easier to drag around the yard.The Amazon description calls this a \"lightweight\" hose. It is NOT  light. It's substantial. I found a local store that  had this hose in 25-, 50- and 75-ft lengths. I was able to lift each and compare to heavy duty hoses of the same length. I couldn't feel much of a difference, so I definitely would call this a medium- to heavy-weight hose (but lighter than my rubber one).This hose is easier to handle than my old rubber ones because it's more flexible. (I suspect that my old hoses have stiffened over the years.)I've only used one (I bought 3 of these) for about 1.5 weeks. It's been too hot, too muggy and too rainy to use it much, but I'm pleased so far. I believe this hose is a very good quality and should last many years. The solid brass fittings are thick so they won't get dents that cause leaks. Because I haven't dragged it around the yard yet, I cannot say whether it really is a \"no-kink\" hose. I recommend this hose because o the quality.
B00002N8K3 This hose is 100 feet and it makes it halfway around my house.  A high quality hose for the price.
B00002N8K3 I purchased 6 of these hoses with what was supposed to be a lifetime guarantee. After a short time, the end on one of the hoses started leaking so I contacted the manufacturer and got a replacement. A year later another hose started leaking and I got another replacement. Then another hose started leaking but the company would no longer honor the warranty! Now Gilmour is selling them. But it's the same hose - \"Flexogen\". The hose itself it actually quite good if you don't mind replacing the hose ends eventually, I've had to replace every end on every Flexogen hose that I have.Keep in mind that I bought hoses from Flexogen but that company no longer exists and Gilmour would not honor the warranty on those hoses even though Gilmour is now selling them. Also note that Flexogen is a patented hose. Lifetime warranty isn't much good when the company gets bought or taken over by another company and the new company (Gilmour) won't honor the warranty. And who wants to have to keep sending in hose parts to get a replacement every year or two.Let me reiterate, Gilmour would not honor the warranty on my Flexogen hoses. I wrote to them multiple times and was told (without explanation) that Gilmour would not replace the defective hoses. If you buy these hoses expecting a lifetime warranty, you may not get it.On the Gilmour website, there is no longer any information relating to Flexogen hose warranty or on how to have a Flexogen hose replaced.  On Amazon, it does say \"This heavy-duty garden hose is made in the USA and backed by a lifetime guarantee\". It also says Lifetime Guarantee on the front of the hose package. Gilmour is now owned by the Robert Bosch Corp., so probably even less chance of getting a warranty replacement.
B00002N8K3 Even my landscaper said the Gilmour Flexogen 10058100 8-Ply Hose 5/8-inch by 100-foot is the BEST! YOU JUST CAN'T KINK IT!
B00002N8K3 BEEN USING NOW FOR 3 YEARS.  SLOWLY REPLACING ALL HOSES WITH THESE. KEEP THEM WRAPPED IN A WIND UP STORAGE CONTAINER AND IT LOOKS LIKE I SHOULD HAVE MANY YEARS OF QUALITY HOSES.
B00002N8NR I really like this sprinkler. It works great, the pattern of water covers the distance that they said it would. Others I have purchased did not do so well and some did not last very long. I think Rain bird is a good company that I can rely on for good quality. Kind of rare now days.
B00002N8NR For years I have purchased impulse sprinklers that work for a while, then plastic parts broke.Now that I have the Rain Bird I am certain that this well made sprinkler will outlast all the others.It is easy to adjust and gives good coverage.
B00002N8NR I read all the positive reviews and was excited about it. Now im excited to replace it with a plastic rain bird sprinklerPros: Solid build, strong material construction, quick performer, very easy to adjust the spray pattern.Cons: It does not have a gasket on the bottom thread so youll need to add some plumber's tape to get a solid seal. It has some overspray that goes beyond the spray pattern which is disappointing if you wanna keep from wasting water. Expensive! At this price, I could have purchased two plastic Rain Bird sprinklers.Other: I recently tested three different impact sprinklers (on video) and so far the best seems to be the plastic rain bird, youll see my video review from youtube this one and the plastic one if you view the plastic one.
B00002N8NR I've had 2 of these now for 3 years and they work really well.  The range is not quite 41 feet, but that's probably due to my water pressure. i'd say its closer to 30 at most.  another impact sprinkler i have goes a few feet further, but it's not the biggest deal.  The positives about this are that it's very solid- i've never had a problem with it not operating properly, and it seems to spray the area very effectively. Considering that they're going on 3 years now, i'd buy them all over again with no hesitation.
B00002N8NR We have unfiltered irrigation water - and the sprinkler heads get clogged with weeds, etc.  This one seems to be more tolerant of that - and it really has a reach for distance.  Good weight also helps keep the sprinkler in place
B00002N8NR These sprinkler heads are well made, very functional and easy to use; changing the settings is quite simple; highly recommended
B00002N8NR IMO, the gold standard in impact sprinklers.  Buy one (OK maybe four) and be done with it.Rain Bird has built this right for decades and it's a wonder why so many other companies cheapen this simple design.
B00004DTNH I used to use a really primitive manual edger that I inherited from my father. Blistered hands and time wasted, I decided there had to be a better way and this is surely it.Edging is one of those necessary evils if you want a great looking house. I don't edge every time I mow. Usually I do it every other time. The first time out after a long winter, edging usually takes a little longer. After that, edging is a snap because you are basically in maintanence mode.I also use this around my landscaping and flower beds with equally great results.The blade on the Edge Hog is easily replaceable and the tell tale sign to replace it is when the edge starts to look a little rough and the machine seems slower.
B00004DTNH At the risk of sounding like an idiot...I am 45-years-old. I have been a homeowner for nearly 20 years. And I have NEVER had a power edger. I have edged my lawn for almost 20 years with an old-fashioned, manual edger. Finally, after too many blisters, a sore back, and just plain old laziness, I decided to treat myself to the Edge Hog. And boy...Am I glad I did! Right out of the box, I could tell this was a quality product. Assembly couldn't have been any easier. Just attach the top handle to the bottom handle. No tools required! And everything else is pre-assembled. I had used a power edger in the past. Like maybe 30 years ago when I borrowed one from a friend so I could get the lawn done quicker and go play ball or something. But for all practical purposes, this was my first time. And it was easy as pie. I had no problem getting the hang of using the Edge Hog. The edging was done fast and easy. What a difference, too! No more raggedy edge like I got from my manual edger. Instead I now get a nice clean \"professional\" edge. Finally! And my back is so much happier!! The price on this product is competitive with other retailers. I had a $25.00 gift certificate and am an Amazon Prime member. So for about $65.00 total, I am now the proud owner of this quality Black & Decker edger. I highly recommend this product. If I could give it 6 stars, I would!
B00004DTNH I had a previous Edge-Hog for a little more than 8 years when the motor brushes finally wore out.  I could have bought the replacement parts and changed them out for $30, but then I decided to just get a new one.  There are a couple of changes between the older and the newer model.  The new unit is lighter and seems to have more power, though that may be because of the new brushes working better.  The one BIG change is the guard over the blade.  It is too soon to tell if this is an improvement or just a way to save money on their part.  It certainly is less safe.The older model had a &#34;swing open&#34; cover which protected the blade almost completey above the ground level.  Good part about that was not being able to get fingers or toess into the cutting area.  Bad part was having to stop for built up grass, or when the ground was wet, built up mud.  You'd have to stop and open the door to clean out the area.The newer model doesnot have a cover and most of the blade area is open.  There is something akin to a bicycle fender covering the blade for protection.  The first day I used it, the ground was wet and dirt built up in the shield, but not enough to really bog down the blade.  I unplugged the unit for safety sake, but unlike the older model, you needed a big screwdriver to pull out all the mud.  If you use it on dry ground, the newer model will have less build up of grass than the older one.I am hoping to get at least eight years out of this unit, like I did with my last one.
B00004DTNH The Black & Decker LE750 Edge Hog 2-1/4 HP Electric Landscape Edger is so easy to use and does a great job of edging my lawn. I purchased this edger because I became so tired of trying to edge my lawn with a string trimmer. The string trimmer did a choppy job, but the B&D edger makes a nice and neat edge on my lawn. Before this purchase I dreaded the job. The fact that this edger can also make trenches is a big plus. I am a female senior citizen and care for my lawn myself. Anything that makes that job easier (like this edger) deserves five stars. I highly recommend this product to anyone who needs an edger that is easy to use and does a good job.
B00004DTNH It wouldn't be too difficult to design a wider cutting blade that would create a wider 'trench' (although the motor might need some beefing up to handle the additional load) and it would be great if it was easier to get more depth too (it's possible but requires a little backyard re-engineering).  It's worth what it costs, though...I'm basically satisfied.
B00004DTNH dang this thing does some work, i just grab the handle and off i go, my lawn edges never looked so good.
B00004DTNH This is the latest version of an edger B&amp;D has been making for at least 20 years, and there are plenty of the 20 year old models still in use. It's nearly silent, much easier to use than a gas model, and seems to  cut better with less stalling than my neighbor's 3.5HP gas model.
B00004DTNH This edger does the job and more.  I give it my highest recommendation.I hadn't edged my lawn since last Fall when my gas-powered edger bit the dust.  We have St. Augustine grass here in Florida.  It propagates by spreading tough, vine-like runners.  I had these in spades creeping over my driveway and over onto the concrete rain channel gutter in front of our house.  This edger cut right through them, which I didn't expect, given the toughness of the grass.  But it never hesitated, except on some very stuborn growth.  I just backed up and hit it again and away the edger went, without even breathing hard.  Even the gas-powered edger wasn't this good.The secondary handle and the adjustable edge guide are quite helpful.  I never felt like this edger had taken control and gone where I didn't want it to go.  Its light weight, easy rolling wheels and great cutting power more than compensate for the 100-ft extension cord it's tethered to.  I think it took me as long to rewind the cord as it took to edge the grass (total edging is about 200-225 linear feet).  Also it has two large wheels in the back and one at the front, so it stays level and makes it easy to push in a straight line.  With the edge guide that rides against the driveway or walkway there was very little of the sparking caused by the blade hitting the concrete.This is about as easy as it gets.  No more gas and oil mix, no more new spark plugs, no more 15-20 pulls to get the engine to start, and it's relatively quiet when running.  Just press the trigger and go.  Love it, love it, love it.
B00004DTNH I love this edger!  I have been using it for almost 2 years, and it is still going strong.  It has plenty of power, yet is easy to maneuver.I get a beautiful, straight edge along my sidewalk from using this tool.  It is so easy to guide in a straight line.  I also use it to keep a trench space between my grass and my landscaped areas, which has worked much better than a trimmer.We had a gas powered edger before this one, but it was too heavy for me.  I actually enjoy yard work, but rarely did it because the tools we had were difficult for me to manage.  Now that I have this electric edger, which is significantly lighter without the gas tank, as well as a manual mower, I do most of the yard work, and love it!
B00004DTNH I've purchased a lot of B&D product and edger is one of the best! The trench feature is a great addition and it works great.  I can edge my small yard in minutes and I don't have to worry about mixing fuel or having to winterize my equipment.
B00004DTNH If you need an edger, and don't want the trouble of maintaining a gas-powered edger, this is the electric edger for you. It's more powerful than most, and sturdy as all heck. But it's also pretty light, too. Very easy to move around the yard.This tool is as indespensible as my lawn mower. If you're edging your lawn with a string trimmer, or not edging your lawn at all, you'll love the results you can get so easily with this edger.
B00004R9TK So what did you want to know? I started my trimming carrier with the Black & Decker Automatic Feed Spool (AFS). It is just plug and go. I prefer my trimmer string to come from Black & Decker. This way I will not come unraveled trying to use some cheap substitute. The spools last longer than expected. But all good things come to an end and you don't want to be half way through the yard when you find your self strung out.
B00004R9TK This &#34;Black & Decker AF-100 String Trimmer Replacement Spool&#34; is exactly what I needed for my Black & Decker cordless weed trimmer. This is east to install and it works as well as the original spool that came preinstalled on my trimmer.Works as expected!Highly Recommended!CFH
B00004R9TK If you have a Black and Decker string trimmer that uses auto-feed string, this is the spool to buy. The string works well. The spool snaps in easily and you don't have to mess with rolling a spool with bulk string.
B00004R9TK This is the direct replacement part for the B&D; Grass Hog model NST2018.  I love that trimmer as it is easy to use and I don't have to fight with a gas powered trimmer and all the problems involved with using one.  This replacement spool directly fits onto the trimmer and is easy to change.  The trimmer is designed to automatically feed the trimmer line and I didn't want to mess with rewinding line onto the old spool.For me the 30 foot spool will last a whole cutting season or more and it is just easier to deal with than buying trimmer line and winding it yourself.  This is a good buy and works well.  I recommend it to you!
B00004R9TK This is a direct replacement and works great. My only gripe is that this particular weed eater uses way to much line.
B00004R9TK I bought this for my black and decker trimmer and where else would i buy these? its not worth driving to the store and look in different eisle to find something simple as these. Also amazon always seem to have the better price.
B00004R9TL GOOD
B00004R9TL At the time I purchased these replacement spools the official Amazon description listed only GrassHog NST2018 as compatible model. I can confirm that it works with the new GrassHog NST2118Black & Decker NST2118 12-Inch 18-Volt Ni-Cd Cordless Electric GrassHog String Trimmer/Edger.The automatic feed spool on GrassHog advances the string without needing to bump on the ground. The benefit of this system is that cutting is easier as it constantly replaces worn out string, the down side that the usage of the string is faster than when done manually.I have tried wounding the string by hand and found it a bit cumbersome and a bit time consuming, so I figured less than $5 per spool is not to bad to save me 5 minutes of time wounding and dealing with jammed string. Each spool contains 30 feet of 0.065 inch diameter round line. It is factory spooled and is wound tighter than when I wound the spool by hand.To replace the spool:1. Remove battery2. Squeeze the tabs on the spool cap to release it3. Pull the empty spool out by pulling directly away from the housing4. Clean out the housing from debris5. Make sure that the level that controls the spooling  is aligned with the edge of the housing6. Take a string from the new spool and feed it through the eyelet in the housing7. Push the spool into the housing and rotate it until it feels seated and the tabs of the spool align with the holes in the housing8. Put the cap back on9. The string outside the housing should be 5 3/8 inches, if it is longer than this length use scissors to trim itCollage of two different views of the spools in this package attached under customer photos.Overall, I am pleased with the spools - they should take me through the next couple of summers!Ali Julia review
B00004R9TL -Quick and fairly easy to install- Seems to be of good quality- Only option I know of for replacements for the B and D trimmer- Too expensive as someone already noted. The retail price is even more out there so I'm glad Amazon cuts the price in half, but still expensive per roll.
B00004R9TL So what did you want to know? I started my trimming carrier with the Black & Decker Automatic Feed Spool (AFS). It is just plug and go.

B00004R9TL Works as expected, no surprises of any kind. I'm now on my 4th three pack and will get a 5th when the time comes.
B00004R9TL Bought for the following trimmer...This little trimmer really eats up the weeds and tall grass. Much better than any other cordless trimmer that I've tried. Battery life is above average and charging is fast. I do have the B&D; Blower that uses the same battery so I have a back up should I need it. I'll edit this review and add to it after I've had the opportunity to use it longer but so far, I am very pleased with the product.
B00004R9TL so good, Bought these as extra to have them on hand and the one my weed eater came with is still working. Will order more as needed, I am all for no muss, no fuss......
B00004R9TL I easily get two years out of a spool of this string while cutting both grass and weeds on my 18v trimmer.  It cuts clean and level and does not shred even on the harder stuff.  On rare occasions you may just break a little of the end off but that just tears away cleanly on your next trim, so no cutting of the line is necessary.  Yes, it is cheaper to just buy the line and wind it yourself, but for roughly $4 and some change it is hardly worth your time and effort.
B00004R9TL I looked around at several websites, and multiple options on Amazon and this was the best deal I found.Fit into my Black and Decker Trimmer perfectly. Just snap in and go.
B00004R9TL For years, I lived with a Black & Decker trimmer that required hand-winding of the line spool.  What a fiasco!  Once the factory-wound spool ran out, the line never again fed properly.  No matter how much care one took with the hand-winding, the line always broke off prematurely -- from having gotten jammed up.  I spent at least as much time rewinding the spool as I did trimming grass.  Then I found the model Black & Decker trimmer that takes disposable spools -- like these.  They're a godsend.  Perhaps it's more economical to wind your own spool, but if your time (and blood pressure) mean anything to you, disposable spools are the way to go.  (And the manufacturer says you CAN hand-wind these spools if you like -- so you won't be stuck if you don't happen to have a fresh disposable spool on hand.)
B00004R9TL Simply - these reels are inexpensive and easy to replace and install. They seem to last pretty long also. Highly recomend
B00004R9TL It took many years for my Black and Decker Gross Hog trimmer to use up all of its string.  Changing the empty string spool was a snap, and the new one works perfectly, just as I would expect.  No complaints.
B00004R9TL My string trimmer is a great light duty tool and works very good. I bought the extra spools of string for two good reasons it is much cheaper through Amazon than our local retailers and with fuel for the auto's being at $3.35/ gal. this saves 3 trips to get the string and luck being what it is chances are when you give out of string the retailer will be out also. Good Buy from a good outfit to do business with(Amazon.com).Thanks again,Denny
B00004R9TL These are the refill for my weed whacker.  They work fine and are easy to install.  It is always good to have a few extra to replace the spent roll.
B00004R9TL I've started winding my own spools now.  These are very convenient, but you really pay a hefty price for that convenience. I'm buying bulk string now and use my drill motor to wind it onto the empty spools.
B00004R9TL ...I wish B&D would make a refill that held more than 30 feet.  Otherwise, it's a good product.  I would give 4.5 stars if I could.
B00004R9TL super easy to swap out and last a long time, unless you are chopping concrete!  I use these all the time, as I feel they are worth the extra cost for the convenience.
B00004R9TL got these for my b&d 20 volt trimmer- fit perfect, and no problems. a little expensive, now rewind myself, but will purchase more in the future for my lazy days!
B00004R9TL I use this on my 18v trimmer.  It seems to last forever.  Changing spools is a little tricky, but once you do it the first time, it really isn't an issue.  Three spools will probably outlast the life of the trimmer - which I think is pretty well made.
B00004R9TL I know it's a lot cheaper to re-string your own spools but these are really convenient, and without the hassle of doing it on your own.
B00004R9TL It installs easily, and it works.  What more is there to say about a product like this.  When you have a weed-whacker, eventually, you will have to refill the spool.
B00004R9TL This is the easiest replacement string to install on a weed wacker. No mess ,just place it in lock it and then go tackle your yard!
B00004R9TL Easy to replace. Summer worth of string in these three spools. Carefully handle so that the string doesn't be OEM uncoiled prior to install.
B00004R9TL What can you say about replacement string. But, in 3 packs, more economical. It is fairly easy to replace. Good product
B00004R9TL I put these in a cordless 18 volt Black and Decker trimmer and they have worked flawlessly.  Just have to put them in the same way the old one came out with no tools just snapping them in place and letting about 4&#34; of string out and they feed the same way.
B00004R9TL Works great and is easy to replace spool of line string for my Black & Decker 20-volt battery/cordless weed trimmer!  Good value when purchased in package.
B00004R9TL I made the mistake of taking the spool that came with my B & D LST136 cordless trimmer and experienced what it would be like if I tried to save money by buying cord in bulk and winding my own spools.  I painstakingly wound the cord from left to right and from right to left as instructed in the manual.  I dropped it a few times and had to begin again.  I did it right because the cord does advance automatically in my trimmer, but I have to say I am glad I purchased spools that are already wound.  When I have to replace the spool that came with the trimmer, I will be careful to hold the cord tightly against the spool!
B00004R9VV BZZZZZTTTT.... ZAP ZAP.  Dead bugs all over the place.  I didnt use any of the mosquito attractant packs or anything but this thing does get rid of all the bugs around that are flying around if you have any lights on outside.  Its fun to catch beatles and throw them into the zapper  :D
B00004R9VV I bought this hoping to kill mosquitoes. I plugged it in and watched the beautiful zapping. After a few nights of this, I did some research and found that 99 percent of those zaps were useful bugs. I decided to return it after killing hundreds of useful bugs in my yard and maybe...maybe a mosquito or two.
B00004R9VV It was a little smaller than I expected, but that was actually a plus in my book. It feels durable and I like the fact that there is not a bug tray for collecting dead bugs. If you were using this on your deck or something, may that would be a different story, but you are really not supposed to use it where you will be sitting anyway. I sprinkled a pile of dietamaceous earth underneath this on the ground so that any crawling bugs like ants that come to feast on the new fried bug bits will meet their demise as well.
B00004R9VV This one has one bulb (versus 2 in the larger units).. I've found that these last a couple of years with regular (daily) use.. My last one lasted about two years - and when it went out, the problem wasn't the bulb - it was the transformer in the top of the unit.  It runs silent (no audible humming from more than a few feet away).
B00004R9VV There's not too much I can say about something as simple as a bug zapper other than -- it works well, it's silent (except when zapping bugs), it DOES attract and eradicate mosquitoes and other flying insects, and it's only 15 watts.Happy with my purchase.
B00004R9VV I recently received this product and just put it out yesterday.  It seems to be working wonderfully and there was a pile of dead insects this morning to show for it!!  I will post again if I have any compaints...but don't really anticipate any.  12/30/08  I now have a complaint!  The light in this unit was faulty.  It still comes on but the light is yellow and not white like it's suppose to be and it doesn't attrack the insects now. The light went out about 2 months ago so it wasn't but maybe 4 months old. 7/27/09 I ordered a replacement bulb on March 22, 2009 to get ready for the mosquito season...today is 7/27/09 and that bulb burned out 2 days ago! 4 month life span...AMAZING!  Needless to say...I WON'T be replacing it again at a cost of $21.99.....and will be looking for another bulb that will work in this unit.
B00004R9VV All products of this type are not effective for mosquito control, so if that's your intent, you must look for an alternative type of apparatus.  Bug zappers like this use UV light; it's been proven time and again that mosquitos have 0% attraction to UV light!  Oh, sure, the octenol attracts SOME types (not all) mosquitos, but the way this device is designed, the octenol cartridge hangs on the BOTTOM of the unit, away from the electric grid.  Mosquitos that are attracted have absolutely no reason to go inside the grid, because once again, they are NOT attracted to UV!All this device will do is kill a bunch of UV-attracted bugs, such as moths and mostly harmless aquatic-type insects that would NEVER have come near your home anyway if you didn't have a bright UV bulb shining in their faces.  Oh sure, by statistical chance, you'll kill a few mosquitos just by chance one flies in there by random but we're talking about less than 5% of the mosquito population will do that.  5% erradication is not going to solve any of your mosquito problems.  Folks, this is all scientific proof, so please don't believe the huff and puff of marketing schemes to make you believe otherwise.  If you need to control moths or non-mosquitos, then this unit might be good for you.  Otherwise, look for something else.
B00004R9VV Only draw back I could come up with is my girlfriend is convinced the light is attracting more bugs from the neighborhood. lol.  We have a pool and a pond, along with wetlands on our property, so we simply have a lot of bugs.  This thing is working constantly while it is on.  The zapping can get quite loud, but it is doing its job.  We have it set up about 20 feet from out deck, and 15 from the pool.  You don't want it closer, as it will bring bugs around.  They are attracted to it...which is exactly what you want! Just not right next to you.  Cord it short, so you will need a heavy duty extension cord.  I hung mine on  a trellis, but if you don't have something to hang it from, you may need a sturdy stand...this things is pretty massive, and has some weight to it.
B00004R9VV After a major fly infestation in Southern California this summer, I wanted something a little less offensive (smell-wise) than theRESCUE! FTD-DT12 Disposable Fly Trap(s) I'd been using to great effect. I did my research on Amazon and Flowtron was the hands-down winner. Although our entire lot is only 2000sf, I decided to spend the extra few dollars on the 1-acre model.It seems to work well, because I hear the thing buzzing all night long, and the housing definitely leaves a lot of space for insects to get in--one morning I found a praying mantis stuck in it. My major insect concern, though, was flies, and because they're only active during the day, the Flowtron is moot. And I was really looking forward to seeing some of those biting flies get their just deserts. If the mosquitos are getting theirs, maybe the ants are hauling the corpses away before I can do a body count.So what insect population am I decimating? Moths, evidently. The problem is, I don't mind the moths! One day I'll have a bigger backyard and then I'll give it a real workout (and an updated review). Still, I have no regrets about buying this unit.
B00004R9VV Let me start by saying DO NOT BUY STINGER!!!  I bought 2 from Wally World and both are dead within a week.  I mean the light is barely visible already and it is no longer attracting insects.  I bought them because they were less expensive basically to save a buck.  I ended up throwing them away and buying 2 of these to replace them.I already have been using a Flowtron 1 Acre in one corner of my house for the past 4 years and it is on all the time.  It has been incredibly reliable and effective.  These are the only Electronic Insect Killers I recommend.
B00004R9VV The unit is certainly getting a workout after the wet summer.  I have not had any issues with the unit becoming clogged.  I used a timer to save the unit from operating during the day to limit electricity use and save the bulb life.  An unintended consequence of this unit was that I was able to light up a fairly dark area in our yard that gives an added sense of security.  I would recommend.
B00004R9VV ....to really tell if it works as we are short of mosquitos this year and I have not attached the bait that comes with it to attract what there are.  I have had several of these in the past and they proved effective and this should be the same.  Bulb cost is minimal thought limits advertised effectiveness to a half acre.  I'm not sure how they figured that out but our deck is 20 feet from a small pond that hatches these guys and this little machine should be OK to zap 'em.
B00004R9VV Great price and it attracts bugs. It is on the side of our house and it seems to be helping.
B00004R9VV I am with a very small number of reviewers here that I have to wonder how this silly thing got that many positive reviews. I have a small backyard, but was constantly attacked by mosquitoes everytime I went out. I have no standing water or what so ever. My neighbors might, but this thing is supposed to cover an whole acre.I followed the instruction, hung it a good distance from the porch and let it go. Oh, I also add the flowtron tape that came with the device to the bottom. A few zaps here and there, but nothing spectacular. I left it on out there for a week, and saw no difference. Still got attacked by mosquitoes. Two weeks, same thing. After a month, I gave up and took it down. There is no point to waste electricity. Oh, it served one purpose: light up that corner of the yard some.So, don't waste your hard-earned money on this thing and electricity. I am almost sure you will be disappointed. This thing will go on my next trip to Goodwill.
B00004R9VV Can't say enough good about this unit. I did a LOT of research before buying one and have to say i'm very happy with this choice. It make a big difference on our back porch so long as you follow the directions. You want it mounted AWAY from where you're relaxing so it attracts the insects away from you. This thing zapps them non-stop. Sometimes we just sit on the back porch and laugh at zap after zap. :)
B00004R9VV This light is pretty worthless.  It kills lots of moths and other non-biting bugs but didn't put a dent in the mosquito or fly population.  I got this as an alternative to my unreliable SkeeterVac but it does not work and is equally unreliable.  The bulbs blew after 1 season.  Replacement bulbs are $40 each plus shipping.  It takes 2.  That is $90 for 2 bulbs and I only paid $80 for the whole unit.  Thanks but no thanks.Unfortunately, the only thing I've found that actually catches mosquitoes is the propane powered devices.  They are all unreliable too.  Skip the zappers and traps and use deet.
B00004R9VV Thus far after a week has done a good job but have to use a blower every day to blow out the debris, Bulbs are good and I run it24/7 thus a good buy, Having lots of mosquitos I bought to ofthe 1/2 acre ones thus put them in different places around the home here, Big plot of land here in rural area of gulf coast, Does not get them all but sure helps a lot
B00004R9VV I purchased one of these for my backyard that is about 1/2 acre and has lot's of foliage and a koi pond.  I built a stand for it and placed it about 20' from our patio, on the oppsite side of the koi pond and it seems to work very well.  It utilze's an arc of electricity to kill the insects that are unlucky enough to go to the light.  There are verticle bars surrounding the lamp that when a insect touches two of the bars, the flowtron utilizes the insect to complete the circuit until there isn't sufficient insect left (burnt up) to continue the arc.  Generally this is a fairly quick process (ZAP) however the occasional moth or larger bug will fly in and you'll hear a nice zaaaaaaaap or sizzzzzzzle until enough is \"gone\" to break the arc.Maybe it's morbid - I enjoy hearing the zap and the occasional sizzzzzzzzle because that is one less nusuance bug to bite my family, my guests or my dog.  I can whole heartedly recommend this product!
B00004R9VV For instance, if you want the bugs off of your patio, do not install it on the patio.  Install it about 25 feet away, and you will be amazed at how well it works.
B00004R9VV SO living on a mini ranch I got this to cut down on flies and mosquitoes.  The mosquito attractant did a good job, but didn't last that long, and was expensive to replace. The pesky \"flies\" go to bed at night so they aren't attracted to it.  Otherwise it would just attract \"non pesky\" bugs in my opinion like moths and I felt really bad hearing them sizzle and zap when they didn't bother me. One night I went out and noticed there was a lot of moths and huge ones all around the bug zapper. I felt like they were trying to tell bugs and moths to stay away, so I took it down.. I know I am crazy and too kind but I kinda believe in Karma and not hurting anything unless it hurts me so I will just use it for bbq's and times where I am outside, and make sure I have the mosquito attractant.. I know I am crazy, but that is how I feel :)
B00004R9VV We have had a very wet summer here in Georgia and the bugs have been horrible. This was a great price for what you get and does the job.
B00004R9VV I just threw away one of these  that I've had for over twenty years. I later found out that what I thought was an electrical issue, was really only a bulb gone bad. Well, anyway, I bought a new one and it looks a lot better than the old one, and seems to work just as well. Not sure just how many mosquitoes it's killing, but there's a pile of insects on the deck below it every morning.
B00004R9VV received this yesterday and installed it. it replaced an old one by flowtron I have had for 10 years. this one is for 1 acre and the light appears to be very intense. it was zapping last nite.
B00004R9VV Not sure if this really gets mosquitoes.  It does kill everything else. It is like a redneck carnival outside!  It goes crazy the first few nights it is outside and then tapers off.  So it does a good job of keeping bugs down.  Unfortunately it kills good bugs and pesky bugs.I bought the mosquito sent, but they don't stay stuck to the bottom well.  There is not enough surface area for the sticky part to adhere to.It is also pretty bright.  I had to close the blinds at night as it lite up the whole room.
B00004R9VV I have my old machine from Sear Lure is not reguire it was heavy. Sorry to get rid of it. The new one was not really working right. hardly kill bug.
B00004R9VV i have not taken this out of the box yet but it looks great. note: it is recommended that this be located a certain distance from the house it protects...and it requires power.
B00004R9VV I do love this bug zapper, but I noticed there weren't as many dead bugs around it as I thought there would be, seeing as we have a heavily wooded property complete with creek (lots of bugs!).  One late night, almost midnight, I went out into the side yard with my dog so she could do her business, and saw BATS flying from the woods and zooming by the bug zapper, then back to the trees again.  The bats were picking off the bugs that were attracted by the bug zapper!  How cool is that?!?  I am such a city kid that I made myself a cup of hot cocoa and sat by the back door with the porch light on, just watching the bats go back and forth.  Since that evening, I've seen the bats almost every time I happen to go outside late at night, so I guess my bug zapper is doing well to keep our local bats fat and happy.  (I'm glad to say the bats are in no danger from this zapper due to the grid guard, btw.)I've had this 80 watt model for over 3 months now, and it works beautifully even though it's exposed to the wind, rain, and hail.  Depending on how warm the weather has been, I'll take the leaf blower to it to clean the bug zapper every week or two.  With the leaf blower, the bug zapper swings around wildly, but it doesn't damage this sturdy bug zapper!  All bugs come off easily.I also have this zapper on a light-sensitive timer, so it comes on at dusk, and off again at dawn.
B00004R9VV I love hearing the zap zap zap.  Have been using this thing in South Florida for over a year now, and left it out to brave quite a few storms, and it's still going on strong.
B00004R9VV For all the negatives, I am giving it 4 stars because it does it job so well.Pros:-It does it job well.Cons:-Power cord is not even a foot long.  You will always need an extension.-Loud, but I don't know any effective zappers without that kind of noise especially when it get bigger insects-It does not have a pan to catch the insects so expect to see a little mess at the foot of the zapper.-Not a very attractive design
B00004R9VV This thing is a bug terminator zapping any bug that comes in. At first it got pretty clogged up (lots of bugs in FL) but the lizards and frogs have done a nice job cleaning it up for me. It&#8217;s to me a necessity here if you want piece from the mosquitos.
B00004R9VV 
B00004R9VV July 18th, Just received the first bug zapper. Currently giving it one star rating r/t it being DOA. As always, Amazon stands by its products and has excellent customer service. I also bought the shepherds crook that is 48\" tall that was purchased by many others, and IMO it is too short. The instructions state to hang it 6-8' in the air. If this is  true, this crook will be insufficient for optimal bug zapping. Hopefully I'm wrong with this one!I'll update when I receive my replacement unit.UPDATE JULY 20thAmazon got me the replacement device with enough time to spare for the party tonight, which I'm exceptionally happy for. The first bug zapper is back in the box waiting to ship back, and the new one is out waiting for tonight for some bug carnage. When I opened the package (which was NOT damaged) the first thing I notice is the electrified grid is bent and misshapen. I tried to push bend it back, but it looks like it is a factory defect. The bad thing is because of this defect, the safety of the device is decreased - I can tough the electrified grid with my fingers without a problem! I'll see if later I can remove the lightbulb so it'll allow me to correct the metal bending a bit more. I luckily don't have children, however if I did they would have zero problems zapping their fingers.Flowtron is DEFINITELY not scoring big points with this device thus far! We will see how things go tonight.UPDATE AUGUST 1stThe bug zapper has been working out great. I can't tell you the thousands of annoying insects this thing has fried. On a cooler night it went crazy. It was the best serial killer I've ever seen. The Mosquitos have had a severely noticeable decline. Previously I couldn't leave the back door for more than 5 minutes without receiving multiple bites, and now can sit outside for 30 minutes with a rare bite attempt. Huge improvement! The zapping grid is still a bit bent out of shape, but its obviously working, so no complaints!One note: In the directions it states, \"The (product number)15 and (product number)80 are designed with a three pronged (grounded) plug). The (product name)40 is made with a two pronged plug and should be installed with the appropriate plug recepticle. ... NOBODY sells 2-prong extension cords anymore! And with the literally 1' cord that it comes with this is KIND of a huge thing! I guess we'll see what happens with the 2 hold cord in a 3 hole plug!
B00004R9VV Can't speak to the 1 acre coverage, but, it does the job for the back deck. Not as loud as other bug zappers we've had and that's a good thing.
B00004R9VV We just received this unit this week, and can already note an improvement in our yard. We have used dunks for some water gardens we have, and have been impressed with the Flowtron unit thus far. A lot of dead mosquitoes every morning. We hook it up to an outdoor timer and run the unit automatically from dusk to dawn.  It will take about three weeks for all the eggs to hatch and mature then we'll see a great reduction in mosquitoes.It's been a very wet in North Texas and we have a bumper crop this year. Am going to explore mixing up some hot pepper and garlic--recipes are available online as a barrier. We hope a combination on factors can help rid us of a heavy mosquito population. Have not noticed any beneficial insects on or under the grids.We compared brands and sizes and selected this one due to reviews of others on Amazon. Recommend the bigger wattage for better attraction of flying insects--with mosquitoes being our main target.
B00004R9VV We found the 80D not much more to buy than the 1/2 acre 40D, and it likely does provide a wider area of coverage.  It will use more electricity, but I intend to put it on a sensor, so it will run dusk to dawn.  As others reported, we found a pile of carnage after the first night....mostly mosquitoes.  Read the instructions about locating and baiting....ours is forty feet upwind of our hot tub, patio, and screened porch so the black light and scent bait draws bugs away from us, and intercepts those coming from upwind.  Far enough away from food and guests to avoid the health hazards reported, and the &#34;zapping&#34; is not obtrusively loud.Ours arrived with a small plastic tab laying in the bottom of the tray.  Investigating, I discovered a self-tapping screw had cross-threaded during assembly, breaking off one of four tabs used to secure the safety cage.  This would not have easily been detected by Quality Control at Flowtron.  I contacted Parts and Service.  They had me email my Amazon receipt, and immediately sent me a replacement cage.  Nice service!
B00004R9VV This does not make a huge difference in mosquito's bothering us.  It just lets us hear them die once in while. There is a perverse pleasure in that.
B00004R9Y2 We use these loppers for our habitat restoration work at the Nature Conservancy's Ives Road Fen Preserve.  They can cut a fairly large bush or sapling.  After 100 hours or so of use the linkages wear.  After more hours the fiberglass handles become flexible and fracture where the rivets go through them.  We have figured out how to rebuild/repair both of these areas.  In seven years two blades have broken.  Replacement blades can be purchased from the Corona website.  A homeowner using these would have no problems in a lifetime of use.  These are the best combination of high capability and low cost that we have found.  The anvil type blade can be easily sharpened with a hand-held angle sharpener.
B00004R9Y2 At first I didn't like this Corona pruner because it didn't seem to cut well.  Then I realized the source of the problem was me.  I was pruning deadwood inside a hedge with little clearance for the handles, so the jaws were not fully open and the cuts were being made near the tip of the blade and anvil.  User error.  Not only did the pruner cut poorly in this position, but also the blade tended to twist.  Finally I figured out this pruner comes into its own when cutting deep in the V.  That is where its power comes into play and that is where the pruner works very well. Not sure why the difference, but there it is.  So now I know to reserve this Corona pruner for when its jaws can be opened wide, and to use a smaller pruner or a small saw for tight spaces.
B00004R9Y2 the first thing that happened was that the two end caps fell off. where? i don't know. but i hope to find them. i really think this is a 1 inch capacity lopper. in my experience there is no way this can cut 2 inches of wood. what kind of wood can it cut 2 inches of? yes it is a great tool but for 1 inch branches or less. i am happy that i bought it but it is for light duty and it does a great job of light duty work. i have been outside clearing a lot of branches and brush and i cannot ever see this cutting 2 inches of anything.
B00004R9Y2 I needed some loppers to cut some branches on some trees, decided to go with these because of the price and all the positive feedback.  They work flawlessly and now I can keep my house trees trimmed to where I want them.
B00004R9Y2 On a brisk February day the mighty Spudman purposely trod to the extremes of Spud Acres to cut some kindling for his fireplace and test out his new 32\" Corona anvil lopper with a stated two inch capacity. He laid out some fallen branches of varying diameters and with arms like pistons began to cut. On smallish one inch wood he was mostly successful with few drops of sweat shed.An intimidating 1.5\" branch tested his mettle and the lopper's metal, but with his brute strength Spudman prevailed. However he met his match with the imposing two inch diameter branches, stubborn wood that even he with his new Corona couldn't master. Frustrated, he tried his tool on a thick piece of rotted wood. Success! But just barely.The dejected Spudman walked back to the house, sat down, and read the glossy attachment that had been tied to the Corona.32 inch compound action - check24 inch fiberglass handles - check8 inch non slip foam grips - checkCuts up to 1.5 inches - chabonga!He returned to Amazon and read the product page again. \"It don't say nothin' bout 1.5 inches,\" he griped.Since he had scored a warehouse deal and bought his loppers for pennies under 20 dollars, he decided to keep them. IThe Corona will keep company with his little Fiskars and the Ace telescoping-handle loppers in the garden shed. Spudman will continue to use his Corona loppers for the one inch wood. For the thicker stuff, he'll use his little Black and Decker 18V battery powered chainsaw or just snap the sticks into pieces with his Herculean arms.\"Made in Taiwan to Corona's exacting specifications.\"
B00004R9YQ Corona makes the best quality gardening equipment.  I own pruning saws as well as the hand pruners.  Most importantly they last forever! I have experienced so many other brands that give out after just a little use.
B00004R9YQ I have used a number of pruners, but these are my fav.  Sharp and powerful.  Like the fact that you can sharpen them rather easily extending their value and lifespan.  Great for all my needs.
B00004R9YQ I really love these pruners. They are heavy duty (up to 1 inch). They are more reasonable than some similar Felco pruners I bought (which are also good). I recommend these.
B00004R9YQ These clippers are great.  Easy to grip and sharp enough to really get the job done.  I like the locking hook that keeps them closed when not being used.  Also, the red handles are a big help to spot them when you've laid them down among your clippings.
B00004R9YQ I lost my pruners in a move and had let my plants get sadly overgrown while I was SURE I was going to find my old pruners. Finally, my front yard looked pretty ridiculous and I came here in search of relatively inexpensive bypass pruners. I read lots of reviews and decided to go with this, and I'm glad I did. I had no problem using these to cut small branches and bushes. The handle felt comfortable in my (fairly small) hands, it hasn't stuck or jammed, and they feel like they're made to last. Thanks for steering me right, other reviewers. :)
B00004R9YQ I recently purchased these pruners in a package that contains a second pruner that also cuts string and opens boxes. Lifetime guarantee, and both at the local Costco cost the same as the one on Amazon.
B00004R9YQ I am a landscape contractor and we use a lot of different hand tools. There are a number of very pricey pruners out there but I have found that these operate extremely well at a fraction of the cost of some others. They are forged heavy grade pruners with nice grips. Just keep the blades oiled and clean.
B00004R9YQ This pruner does not even remotely cut 1&#34; branches, wet or dry.  Does not cut 3/4&#34; branches.  It may cut SOME 1/2&#34; dry branches but at least the one I received was not sharpened and I was forced to return it.  Have not decided on a new one yet, since I was so disappointed after reading all the great feedbacks and finding different.
B00004RA0O this is a very good product.  i laid it on top of 4 metal fence posts at the corners of my strawberry bed.  it is surprisingly strong.  it gets snagged on just about everything, but does not rip.  it keeps the birds and cats out of my strawberries.  i will be buying more in the future.
B00004RA0O I originally purchased this to keep stray cats out of my raised beds.  The material, however, is too flimsy and if the cat (or any other large animal) really wanted to get into the beds, it wouldn't have too much trouble cutting through the netting with its claws.  So I had to pursue a different path to keep the cats out.I did, however, keep using this material to keep birds and other unwanted pests (moths, butterflies, etc.) out of my garden.  Having another pair of hands around to help with installation is good because this material tangles easily and snags on just about everything, including itself.  So you need to exercise care when putting it on otherwise it will rip.  I also realized after a few months of use that the mesh size is too large so moths and butterflies can easily squeeze themselves through the netting and make their way to the plants.For the price, it's a decent product.  I'm thinking I can get at least one, maybe two, season's worth of use before I have to throw it out and start with fresh material.  Next time around, I will look for a stronger material that I can reuse for more than a couple of years.
B00004RA0O The local bird population was eating all the raspberries a day or two before they were ripe enough for us. This thwarted them!It is a bit tricky to put on by oneself. I recommend at least two people if you have much of a span to cover.  We will be buying more.
B00004RA0O I managed to get this stuff wrapped around all my fruit trees last year (quite a job - it snagged on all the branches and even my buttons, but with the help of another person and two long poles, we did it.)  I guess it worked well enough but I will never use it again since it doesn't just keep birds away, it traps them.  I managed to spot and free a bluebird and a cardinal that had become entangled, before they died of thirst or were found by cats.  But then one day I found a bluebird all dried up hanging from the netting - poor thing, what a horrible way to die.  :(  I want to protect my fruit, but I don't want to kill songbirds, certainly not slowly over a period of days.  So I am going to try some of those products that are supposed to merely scare them away, not kill them.
B00004RA0O We made a PVC \"greenhouse\" framework and stretched this over it to keep birds and hornworm moths out. So far, it's working pretty well.Great stuff. Can get hung up on the roll when you're rolling up what you don't need. Cheap enough to throw away at the end of the season without pain.
B00004RA0O Okay, I'm not using this netting like the other folk, but perhaps you too are  looking for a solution to THAT deer that's so bold he doesn't hesitate to come up onto the porch to nibble the delicious buds off your potted plants.My particular problem this year wasn't that, but it was that someone was dining on the new garden I put in the front yard.  Now, you can't exactly put up deer fencing -- at least not attractively-- at the front of your lawn, but you can protect your plants, it turns out, with this netting.What I did was cut the netting into small swaths which I lay over the plants.  LOL, it apparently has an unpleasant feel on the tongue.  The dear deer hasn't even eaten the lettuces I've got tucked in here and there.  And the best part is that the netting is invisible.  At least I can't see it.So try this out and see if it works for you.  It's allowed us to grow plants that none of our neighbors dare try here in deer-country Virginia.One note of caution:  You need to check periodically to make sure that blossoms don't work themselves into the netting.  I've had to work some free so they could open.Pam T~happy gardenerI'll report back if there's a failure at any point
B00004RA0O Easy to handle but came with no stakes or any kind of tie-down. Also, no directions about how to wrap tree. Spaces seem small enough to keep out birds but it really should come with sample pics or directions. We had to take ours down because we wrapped it too tight and the trees were dying.
B00004RA1S When I first got this thing, I must admit, I was really dubious. It looks odd and gimmicky. Well, using it in my garden has turned me into a believer! It works great on my thick, clay-heavy soil - quickly cultivating the ground, breaking it up and preparing for my attentions. It works great and I highly recommend it!(Review of Garden Weasel Gold Garden Claw Cultivator #91306)
B00004RA1S I planned to use the Garden Claw for stand-up cultivation of my raised beds, and it will be great for that; it's perfect for SFG-style beds.But this is the best part: I've discovered it's perfect for helping me dig post holes for my grape and kiwi trellises. I'm a 4'10\" disabled woman with bad knees and a bad back. I just don't have the upper body strength to ram a post-hole digger into the clay soil in our fescue-matted field, and the two big, strong men in my household always have something more pressing to do.I discovered the Garden Claw makes a circular hole that's just a tad wider than the post-hole digger does, and I can loosen six or more inches of clay soil and roots in no time. Without strain! Then I can use the post-hole digger to lift out the loosened soil, or I can just spade it out into a bucket for use somewhere else. As weak as I am, I can get two 2-foot holes dug before I have to rest.I've been frustrated because I've been too broke to pay someone to come put these trellises in and worried because I know the vines will be here before I know it. Thanks to the Garden Claw, I can put in my trellises all by myself! It paid for itself the very first day. So far, I'm delighted with it.
B00004RA1S I bought my garden claw several years ago. I was looking for something to help turn compost into my vegetable gardens.The criterion I was looking for was something inexpensive that wouldn't break the bank the way a tiller would. But would still get the job done without causing me to be laid up with back pain for a week. For the most part I have been very pleased.We have 2- 12'x12',and  2-8'x8' beds  along with a few smaller freestyle plots, and we mainly use the claw to add compost and cow manure to them every Spring . With the claw I am able to quickly mix in my amendments, and to loosen up the soil about a half foot down in next to no time. If I want to go extra deep, it does take a double dose of clawing , but it is worth it in the end. And it really is not that much extra work since the soil has been pre-loosened a bit by the first go around.As far as starting a bed from scratch, I have used it to start new plots, but only after the sod has been removed. I do think it would be a tough chore to try to do a new bed from start to finish, with only the Claw,and without removing the grass first, but not impossible.When weeding I find it invaluable for use in between rows. It is a breeze to simply stick the claw into the center of a clump of weeds and give a twist and a tug and be done.My one complaint is that the handle has come a tad bit loose. It is still perfectly functional and it took about 5 or more years of good solid use for that to happen, but for someone with a larger plot who uses it more often it may be a concern.
B00004RA1S We bought the Garden Claw several years ago at our first house and never used it, because the handles are mounted for lefties.  That is, the two hand-grips are each curved to the side, giving a feel of turning a wheel when you use it.  This would be great if you put your hands on the grips and turned it to the right to dig.  But the tines on this gadget are positioned so that you have to \"steer\" the Claw to the left to get them to dig.  Since us righties have more strength in our right hands, it was very awkward to \"steer\" the Claw to the left.  We spent about 20 minutes with it in the garden that day and haven't used it since.
B00004RA1S This is a handy tool for cultivating small areas, but it is not appropriate for anything more than a medium sized flowerbed.  The handles work well to gain leverage, but you will feel it in your muscles if you  attempt to do too large an area!The fact that it isn't powered lets  you get into areas you wouldn't want to go with even the smallest of  tillers, and it does a great job of breaking up the ground to a depth of a  couple of inches, which is perfect for flowers.For larger projects, use  a mini-tiller, and use this tool for the detail work and the smaller beds.  Both tools are a good combination to have at your disposal.
B00004RA3E Currently I hate this thing.  I may need to oil it/adjust it or make some other modifications but it squeaks of metal on metal and cuts about 1/3rd of the grass I pass over with it.  I found a manual mower like this in the yard of the first home I bought and used it for years.  It was better than any mower I've ever owned.  This seems to perform like a cereal box toy imitation of what a manual push mower is supposed to be like.  Pooptastic.  I will update this review if I am able to modify it to actually cut grass, but out of the box it seems to make far too many blade passes per distance traveled to ever perform well.  Also the last model I had had two counter-rotating blades and this only has one rotating in one direction against a stationary blade/block.
B00004RA3E I'm not sure how I missed that important point, but I did.  I don't see that clearly mentioned from scott's, either.  This particular model with the four wheels makes it nearly impossible to use on hills.  It just doesn't have the leverage to cut the grass.  So I'm back to the mower.  One thing I will say is that it cuts well on flat surfaces, but it does require a bit more effort than I thought to push.
B00004RA3E A couple of years ago my husband decided to shove our old mower in the shed and buy this push mower with the sharpening kit and grass catcher. His motivation was that this mower would not pollute and was ecologically responsible.While it isn't hard to maintain or use and it can be adjusted for height easily, I am a finicky type and I really don't care for the job this mower does. I miss the good old days when my lawn looked perfectly manicured with neat paths of freshly mowed grass.The positive in regard to this mower is that it cuts a wide path which theoretically is time saving and efficient. The negatives are more numerous. The handle on this mower has fatigued 6 times in two years. I have ordered replacement handles a couple times after duct taping proved to be a poor fix at best. The grass catcher has been replaced twice because it fell apart. We are on our second sharpening set. The most irritating aspect  of having this mower is that it does a poor job if the grass gets too long between mowings. The weird weather conditions this spring has resulted in my grass seeding twice and growing like crazy. Long strands of germinating grass stand in contrast to the parts that actually do get cut. Most of the time, my husband mows the lawn twice in an attempt to get it even. Usually that makes little difference as to the law
B00004RA3E Everyone I know advised me against getting a reel mower.  I was cautioned that they don't cut well and they're hard to push.  But I didn't consider a gas mower an option (too expensive, noisy, hard to maintain, and dangerous), a corded electric would be too cumbersome, and a rechargeable would be impractical because there is not a convenient place for me to charge it.  So I took the plunge and bought this one.I'm completely intimidated by all things mechanical, so I was worried about assembling this mower, but it really is easy.  The only thing you have to do is screw the five sections of the handle together, then clip it onto the mower body.  The instructions were adequate (3.5 stars there), even for an assembly-phobe like me.  The current configuration does not require any tools for assembly, but there was an add-on bag of washers and nuts included with my mower that are recommended for a more securely assembled handle.  If you opt to use the new nuts instead of the original wingnuts, you'll need a wrench.After just fifteen minutes or so, I was up and running.  To my delight, the mower pushes easily, even through long grass.  And it's very entertaining to watch the grass being rapidly snipped off.  I felt like Edward Scissorhands.  Who would have thought mowing grass would be so fun?  I was a little tired and winded when I finished (in a good way), but I had been practically running with this thing because I enjoyed it so much.  I kept looking for stray patches to go over again, but, alas, the mower did such a good job, when I was finished, my yard looked like a golf course.A few facts about me and my lawn to see if my wholehearted recommendation will apply to you:  I'm female, plus-sized, totally out of shape, and usually quite sedentary (one reason I thought this would be a good idea).  I had never mowed grass before in my life (didn't have a yard before last summer, and then I accepted the fine services of a neighborhood girl with a ride-on mower who worked cheap).  My yard is about 6500 square feet, level, fairly flat, and covered with long pine needles all over the place (the mower didn't even notice them).Some older reviews address a couple of problems that are no longer an issue:  Scotts now (late April 2007) packages the mower with the cushioned handgrip already on, and the apparently easily loosened wingnuts (as already mentioned) can now be replaced with regular nuts (not mentioned in the current manual, but included in the box with a note).  Scotts should have included shorter bolts with the new nuts (since you now don't need the extra length the wingnuts required), but this is a trivial point.  Put your wingnuts on after the new nuts for a more \"finished\" appearance.A reel mower might not be suitable for everyone and every yard, but for me, it's fantastic.  It's quiet, easy to maneuver, non-intimidating, good exercise, fun, environmentally sound, and inexpensive.  I couldn't be happier with this mower.UPDATE 1-17-13I used my mower for the whole season and never had any problems with it.  The next year, health issues forced me to again use the services of the neighborhood girl to mow my lawn.  Then I got married, and my husband wanted nothing to do with a reel mower (though he admitted that it was cool, he'd always used a gas mower, and that's what he wanted to stick with, though I HATE the noise and smell when he mows).  So my Scotts sat in storage for years, and last fall Hubby finally convinced me to let it go.  I sold it for $50 to a single mom with a tween daughter who was going to mow their small lawn.  I let them try it out on our grass, and they were both immediately thrilled and couldn't wait to get home to use it.  I felt like I was kind of passing on a torch.  There's something wonderfully enabling about this mower.  If I found myself again being the person responsible for mowing a small-to-medium-size lawn, I would definitely buy another one of these.
B00004RA3E It's a classic all right, but a clever classic.  This mower is a straight forward push reel mower with a few nice touches.  That second set of wheels replace a roller all right and the clever height adjustment let's you know that someone gave some thought to this device.  One of the one-star complaints regarding this mower involves the difficulty pushing it.  Well, you can alleviate that by simply adjusting the closeness of the blade  or even the angle of the cut; mine was initially a real bear because the blade was factory adjusted to such a closeness that the reel blades added enormously to the drag, far more than the grass did.  Once you've tapped in an adjustment to the closeness of the blade to its stropping plate (remember just 1/4 turn at the most and oil all the blades) it'll be close to effortless.  The main thing, however, is that reel mowers do such a pretty cut.
B00004RA3E Works like a charm. Put it together in a few minutes and cut an overgrown yard at a cabin. Had to make two passes - one at the highest length and one at desired length. The tall weeds did not cut, but I cut them with a lopper. Much easier to maneuver than my power mower and trimmer-mower.
B00004RA3E I have had many people look at and watch me as I mowed our lawn for the first time with this reel mower and all I could think is that these people think I'm going green... well I'm not. I have always lived a conservative life, recycled (still do), and so on. And not because some celebrity told me I should or whatever, but because it just makes sense to do so. So with that out of the way, onto the actual product.When gas prices peaked last summer we stopped using our lawn tractor because it used just too much gas (and it didn't cut the grass all that well to begin with) and just used our self propelled Honda mower. Well after the tractor sat all summer we decided to just sell it and buy a reel mower and so far it has more then paid for itself.The first question EVERYONE asks is, is it hard to push? Plain and simple, NO. These new reel mowers are lighter and are better designed so they are much easier to push then the old Leave It To Beaver style reel mowers. Also the rear stabilizer wheels also makes it easier to handle.The second question that is asked is, how well does it cut the grass. Well that depends on how tall the grass is, how wet it is, etc.. A reel mower cuts with a sheering action (like scissors) instead of a tearing action that is associated with a rotary mower. This leaves your grass in a much healthier state then the tearing action does. Now I will say that it is harder to cut tall grass and we have to mow more often, but that's the nature of the beast.After mowing the lawn for a few weeks with the Scotts 20 inch reel mower I can actually tell a difference in the grass, much better and healthier looking.The only gripe I have is the handle is a bit flimsy and wobbles a lot... kind of a pain when you execute a turn. We'll probably end up welding it together so it doesn't wobble.All said and done it's a bit more work then using our self propelled Honda, but produces a much better looking lawn.Pros:Fairly cheap upfront cost.Little to no upkeep.Leaves your lawn looking awesome.At least ten times quieter then pretty much any rotary mower, thus allows your to keep your windows open when you are mowing.No fumes (darnit I love the smell of gas!).20\" mower path.Cons:Made in China...Some plastic pieces, not sure how they are going to last but we'll see.Wobbly handle.
B00004RA3E I really like this mower a lot.  I have owned a Brill and Sunlawn, but I like the Scotts classic better than either.  I do have a 40 year old Scotts Deluxe that is substantially heavier and which I like the best of all.  I use the old Scotts Deluxe for mowing my own yard and leave the Scotts classic in my trunk to mow rentals.  Here are my pros and cons.Pros.1. Heavier than others.  That makes it less likely to slip when going over uneven lawn or wet grass. It also has more reel momentum making it cut tall floppy grass and leaves better.2. Handle comes off easily.  There are little clips that hold the handle in, but I do not use them. I just pop the handle on and off, making it easy to store in my trunk and use any time.3.  No gas, much, much lighter and smaller than a gas mower. Of course this is true of all reel mowers, but it is an important point for me.  I can leave this in my trunk and not worry about gas fumes or about refilling gas.  It is always ready to go.  With the handle off, it does not take up too much of my trunk and it is light enough to easily take in and out of my trunk.4. Durable.  You might not think of this with a reel mower, but it saves me nice money in maintenance.  I actually mow several rental lawns weekly.  With that much mowing I have to take my mower in for maintenance every year.  Also I have bent the crankshaft on multiple mowers.  The only maintenance on this is sharpening the blade.5.  Easy to sharpen the blade.  This mower is made by American Lawn Mower, which means it can use the very easy, very cheap american lawn mower sharpening kit available from amazon and tons of other places for under $20.  I like the kit and feel I get a better cut with this mower than I did with the brill or sunlawn models.6. Quiet. Maybe it is a little louder than the brill, but it is still super quiet.  If I feel like mowing in the middle of the night, just because I can, I do and it bothers noone.  Now when I use a gas mower, the noise really bothers me.Cons.1. Handle is super flexy.  They really cheaped out on the handle. The sunlawn and brill models are much stronger.  It works and lasted a heavy use season, but it will not last as long as the body.2. Tough time with weeds. Like all reel mowers, this thing does not like to mow anything that is tall and floppy. This one handles weeds and tall grass much better than average, but you should still try to hold down the weeds and cut weekly if possible. That being said my sister often forgets to mow her weedy lawn for a few weeks, and I am able to mow it with my Scotts classic when her sunlawn would have more difficulty.
B00004RA3E I hate gas powered tools! I bought this as a hopeful solution to that problem. Obstacles are a definite problem. The maneuverability is quite limited. With a gas mower you could tilt the back end up and over some small obstacles. That wasn't the biggest problem. A little extra weed whipping to be done. The biggest problem is the quality of the cut. If your grass is not perfect plush growth like a golf course the cut will be OK not great. This mower is for people who LOVE grass. Not for people who HATE gas powered tools because you have to mow almost every other day. I hate mowing and grass. I mow mine down to the ground every time and hope it doesn't rain so I wont have to do it again for 2-4 weeks. Some people coddle their grass. They think of it as a family member. They talk about their grass non-stop. They can have a discussion about bagging over mulching for over an hour. They have chemicals for weed control, ants, grubs, PH balance, feed. They seed and water regularly. They spend several hundred dollars every year on their lawns. Their passion for their grass is second only to their family. If this sounds like you, great! It's great to have a passion and this mower is for you. If you mow your lawn down to the dirt and curse at gas powered tools and HATE mowing. This mower is not for you.
B00004RA3E I wish I could say that I purchased this mower after seeing Al Gores \"inconvenient truth\" and my life was changed by it.  The truth however is that I finally got fed up with my old power mower failing to start for the ump-teenth time after repeated repairs and promises of it now \"running like a champ\".  This old time mower will take some getting used too, and also don't kid yourself, it doesn't do the job as easily as a power mower by any means.  However on the plus side you will never again suffer through a mower that fails you, needs fuel, requires any real maintenance like oil changes or plugs, and best of all if you take care of it, will be the very last mower you ever buy.  The only way this mower will up and quit is if you do.  Any maintenance it does require is easily handled by a screwdriver or wrench.  Even for those whose knowledge of small gas engines doesn't go much beyond kicking it and swearing when it disappoints you. I fully agree with the reviewer here who stated it is best used on pristine lawns with lush healthy grass. (Unfortunately a lot of people that have lawns of such quality often don't cut their own lawns. If you happen to be the exception, read on) This mower cuts thick grass of reasonable length straight and evenly very easily.  Where it fails you is on long loose weeds fluttering in the wind.  The mower passes right over them no matter how many times you try again and again to sever it.  I solved that problem by putting a little more effort into trimming with the weed whacker, and leaving the heavy grass to the mower.  And it by far is most efficient when used regularly once or twice a week.  A time table you will find effortlessly fits most peoples lifestyle since the mower is so light and easy to use that mowing the lawn will no longer be an all day Saturday event.  Unlike lawns where power mowers are used that usually get long and seedy looking in between jobs, you will find yourself taking this mower out far more often just to hit the \"high spots\".  Thus your lawn comes to have the appearance of a man that gets his hair cut every three weeks and thus never looks like he is long overdue.  You can also get away with using this mower early in the morning or late in the evening since it makes very little racket. And one last thing, I didn't notice much difference in the physical effort needed to push it considering that most people use walk behind push mowers in any event.  Aside from having to use it a little more often, and its lack of cutting power on long weeds, I consider this mower to be well worth one's investment.  You will eventually come to find your lawn never looked better.
B00004RA3E Cuts well, etc.; but was missing some Nyloc nuts from the hardware baggie so my dad went to the store to get more.  After assembly it was fine.  But who needs that added hassle?
B00004RA3E I was really looking forward to trying out a reel mower and living a life of maintenance free mowing. It didn't work out. The second time I used it, the grass had gotten a little high, so there was a lot of back and forth action. It took forever, really. I know that this product isn't meant for that, but that was my situation. Anyway, as I was finishing the handle came apart. There are four wingnuts and bolts holding the assembly together, and one on each side had apparently worked their way off while I was mowing without me noticing. The third one came off as I was putting it away and the handle came apart.Yeah, I was putting a lot of stress on it compared to a regular mowing, but that should not have happened. I followed the assembly instructions to the letter. It was really a very simple assembly. I didn't miss any steps or try to do it without reading the instructions, though. I was very disappointed with this product.If you have a flat yard and are going to be able to keep it mowed short without ever letting it get out of hand AT ALL (like leaving town for a couple weeks), this mower may be for you.If you have a sloped, lumpy yard, do not buy this product. Just don't. It is so hard to use. I honestly think I would like it if I had a nice, flat yard, but as it is this thing was worthless to me.
B00004RA3E I ordered my Scotts 20\" Classic Mower on Earth Day and because I had to put it together, I finally used it for the first time in mid-May. I wish all I had to do was put in two screws and be done but there were 5 big pieces to the handle and lots of little pieces (fortunately almost all the same set of pieces). I could put it together with only a little difficulty and I don't have much practice at putting things together. I couldn't get the E-rings in. My husband managed that.The handle flexes. I wondered if that was needed to handle the bumps, but after using it I don't think it is. I think it is just cheap. The mower part feels more substantial.  It is made in China. I wonder how many years of not using my gas mower it will take to make up for transporting this from China.In the reviews people talked about it stopping suddenly. I had the same issue. I have a very small yard; it is level except for a few odd little depressions. At those spots as well as at random moments the mower would freeze up. It happened some times when the clippings kind of got clogged on the back guard. Other times, I could not see why it stopped. It went right over the small sticks in my yard, which I was happy about. On the other hand, all the dandelions just bent over and snapped right back up after I passed over them. I had a few spots where I went at the grass from a few directions before it mowed. Once I got it going it tended to keep going, but every corner meant a full stop and then had to try to get `er rolling again. Next time, I'll see if I can figure out a way to mow with less full corners. As I said it is a small yard, so I'm not sure it will work.Overall I am happy with the product except for the issues I mentioned above. I didn't want to spend too much, so for the price this is about what I expected. I plan to use this every other time I mow. I'm keeping the gas mower to get through the weeds and plants that are out of control. As I'm growing more native plants and food, my area of grass is decreasing.
B00004RA3E I was not sure if this mower would work for me, seeing as my lawn is &#34;too big&#34;, bumpy, and pretty weedy as I don't use chemicals on it.  But I took the chance and am very glad I did.  It's much easier to manage than the gas mower I was using (not self propelled),  and does a good job on the lawn.  If you are looking for a perfectly even lawn this may not be for you, but I don't mind an occasional weed sticking up here or there.  The higher height setting seems to allow the mower to go over most small twigs, which was another concern of mine.  I mow each &#34;section&#34; of my lawn once per week, so the grass does not get too high.  Also I switch mowing directions each time.  If you are not able to keep up with your lawn this probably isn't for you as it does best when cutting about 1/3 of the length of the grass.  Using this mower might take me a bit longer than using the gas powered one, but not by much.  And it's a whole lot quieter and easier to maintain.
B00004RA3E I am a great fan of manual mowers for small yards, although that wasn't always the case. When I was a small lad one fo my shores was to mow a double lot with an old, heavy manual mower, something that soured me on manual mowers for decades. But a few years ago I discovered the new generation of manual mowers, and now I mow my lawn in about the time it took with my gas mower, but without the noise, the vibrations or the fumes. I can mow at 7 in the morning, or 9 at night without bothering the neighbors, too.The Scott has a number of good things going for it: It's light, easy to push, fairly easy to adjust, and you can sharpen it yourself with a simple kit. That alone will save a bit of money. It's my favorite unit in its price class. (My favorite mower is the Brill, from Germany, which is even lighter and easier to push  than the Scott and doesn't require sharpening for 8 years, but which Amazon doesn't carry... yet.)If you do buy the Scott, get the sharpening kit, as when you do need it you'll want to have it on hand. And get a can of Boeshield protectant spray (also available from Amazon). A quick once over with the Boeshield from time to time will greatly extend the life of your mower and keep it easy to push.
B00004RA3E I have about six-thousand square feet of lawn.  This mower handles it quite well.  There's some effort to push it, but it's actually easier in some ways than using a power mower; for example, the lighter weight of this mower makes it far easier to change directions in a tight space.  It's easy to adjust the height of the cut, as well.I'll just note one small problem that I've had and two limitations of all mowers of this type.  There is a thin foam pad on the top of the handle.  On mine, it split on the left side the first time that I used the mower, which isn't a big deal.  Mr. Shenker in his excellent review reports that his mower will cut long grass.  Mine leaves long grass uncut.  I believe that this is simply a limitation of reel mowers in general.  Also, it's probably more important to make sure that the ground is dry with any mower that you power yourself, simply because you need traction on the ground to make the blades turn, and this, in turn, makes it more likely that you'll skid on any mud.  With those limitations, however, I can unhesitatingly recommend this mower.

B00004RA3E It's 9:00am on a beautiful Saturday morning.  The air is a little cool but the sun feels warm on my skin.  The Northern Cardinals are singing and I hear a Golden Fronted Woodpecker chirping in the tree above my head.  As I sit on my back porch and sip my coffee I feel content and happy.Then, my next door neighbor fires up his ridiculously over-sized riding lawn mower.  A few minutes later the guy behind me joins in.  I head inside.  Another Saturday morning ruined.  I decide to make a  point.  Later that day the neighbor is hosting a bar-b-que in his backyard.  As he is tending the grill I chat with him for a while.  He has over 30 guests and they are all having fun talking to each other and laughing.  I announce that it is time for me to mow my yard.  His eyes get big and he stammers \"N..n..now?\"  Yep.  I roll out my brand newScotts Push Reel Lawn Mowerand start mowing right next to his fence.  None of his guests even noticed.  He happily offered me a beer and a brat when I was done.  This mower makes life better.EDIT:  I received aFiskars reel mowera month ago through the Amazon Vine program and, to be honest, I like it better.  I still like the Scotts but the Fiskars is easier to use and requires less maintenance.
B00004RA3E I love push mowers - quiet and when the blades are sharp, they do a great job. This goes for this mower, too. It is ideal if you have a small lawn or want to get a little exercise while mowing. The downside to any push mower is that apparently they require a special skill set to sharpen the blades & most garden shops do not sharpen the blades.  I was able to find one place that sharpens blades in the entire area and it is not cheap. It's not a good idea to do it yourself, quite dangerous, & dull blades are useless. The blades seemed to dull very quickly, if that is possible - maybe they weren't very sharp to begin with. I hope more people will buy push mowers, which will force more shops to consider getting the tools so they can offer sharpening. I have 4 friends who all have the same problem. This has nothing to do with the mower itself, just know that before you buy it, research your area to make sure there is someone who can sharpen it for you.
B00004RA3E I like this.  No need for gas and it cuts very nicely.  I use it in south carolina and my yard is not big.  It is good for my application.  Good work out!
B00004RA3F We purchased a chicago 2-flat about a year ago.  I bought a used $10 reel mower that was awful, but got us through the dry summer last year.  I knew we would need a new one this year.  After watching for sales that never happened I turned to trusty amazon.  So far, I'm completely satisfied with this lil guy!  We have a relatively small yard, so the 14 inch width is completely appropriate.  I also was super impressed at the way it handled long grass.  I know these mowers are notorious for not being able to handle it, but I was pretty pleased.  It may not have cut the long grass like a gas mower, but it really was completely acceptable.  Like a few other reviewers have said it does get stuck on any little twig.  So you might have to stop a few times to bend over and pick them out, but if you're the reel mower type I would assume bending over a few times isn't out of the question.  You can't beat the price either!  I had no issue with the assembly, it took just a few minutes.  After watching my neighbor reel over his in short strokes to get through the yard I was even more glad that I have this guy!
B00004RA3F Couldm't cut my grass very well.  Misses some spots because it just didn't cut it.  if the grass is taller than 2 inches, this is not mower for you.  Need to spend the money and get something that works.
B00004RA3F Who is willing to buy a new product that only has a 90 day warranty? That is the typical warranty on used product. If the manufacturer has little faith in their product, then neither do I.
B00004RA3F I am a avid gardener, I take care of the flowers and my husband takes care of the lawn.  We have had too many cases of lawmmower blight;by definition - the weed wacker or lawn mower cuts down my flowers and bushes.  After too many cases of lawnmower blight, I bought this little mower for trimming near my flower beds that are naturalized (lawnmower blight does not happen at mulched beds).This is a great tool!  Very sharp and easy to push, perfect for what I need it for.  At first my husband was slightly insulted by and for the reason of this pruchase, he even snickered when it came out of the box, but when he tried it he loved it and is now using it to trim by our driveway as is cuts lower than our \"big\" mower.Highly recommend for very small lawns and trimming, remember it is 14 inches wide.I JUST LOVE IT1
B00004RA3F Winter is not the most appropriate time to review a new lanmower, but the truth is that the (coarse) grass was around 6 inches tall. It took two passes but got mowed very nicely. I think this one's a keeper.
B00004RA45 Have a good place to put it. It certainly isn't mobile. But you can put a lot of seeds in here.
B00004RA45 I had never grown from seed before, but I wanted to plant some morning glorys this spring.  I tried to direct-sew last year but that was an epic fail.  I realized if I really want them I need to start them indoors.Off to trusty Amazon I go!  I sort of hastily bought one of the top seed starters that showed up in the search.  I did what it said, and alas I have (some) morning glorys in addition to some basil and cilantro seeds I had sitting around.  I had average sprouting, but I would always attribute that to the seeds more than the plastic trays!I did feel that the plastic cover is VERY flimsy, it actually doesn't fit on the top very well.  I suppose its not that big of a deal because the top isn't really on very long, but I would have appreciated it being a little more sturdy.The bottom tray is a bit more robust and I haven't had any issues as I've moved the full tray a few times.So far its served its purpose, but now as I've done it once I might look around for some different/better options in the future.  Try a few things out, etc.With that said I wouldn't mind using this one again, especially as its inexpensive but I would like to see what is out there.
B00004RA45 Works great, I needed this to start impatiens seeds from Burpee -- they're so small they resemble grains of sand, you actually dip a toothpick in water and use the surface tension to pick up and deposit each seed -- THAT'S SMALL. Keep the transparent lid on until the seeds have mostly sprouted, then remove the lid and slowly \"harden off\" the plants by exposing them to the outdoors and eventually sunlight over time.I wish I'd ordered two or more of these. It's much, much cheaper to start flowers from seed on your own versus buying them at the local Home Depot or nursery. I already ordered more impatiens and I have some vincas I want to get started for the warmer months. Buy some decent potting mix or seed starting mix, or if you're really crunchy granola run some garden soil through your oven @ about 350 degrees for an hour to sterilize it. I like to add some perlite to soil mixes. I also like to water the soil BEFORE THE SEEDS ARE SOWN with Miracle Gro. The transparent dome will maintain humidity while the seeds are sprouting. I'd use a decent plant mister (Couldn't insert product link, URL is http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010H748S/ref=oh_o00_s00_i00_details) to keep the seedlings content.Great product. I really wish I'd ordered two or three of them.
B00004RA45 Very convenient and easy to start seedlings.  They are sturdy and I have reused them more than once.  I recommend these.
B00004RA45 Save your money - Use Styrofoam cups with a blend of soils - this was a ridiculous and very expensive attempt at greenhouse gardening .............
B00004RA48 I purchased this item locally at a discount store for much less, so be sure to check around before you buy.I purchased two, knowing that with my history I'd be lucky with 10 percent actually sprouting. But I was wrong! My granddaughter and I did the first tray together. She poured the water, then I counted out the seeds for her to plant. Her Mom and I did the second tray after she got bored. Within three days the first of the plants were up. It has now been 8 days and nearly every pellet has seedlings. I have already had to move the first ones (cantaloupe) to a large peat pot since they are five inches tall! I am using one of the top covers under the four large peat pots.Almost all of the others are 2 inches tall, but still fragile.This will be my first garden grown completely from seed, and I will definitely use this again next year!Edited, All of the plants are in the ground and doing well! Tomatoes are sprawling all over the place, Zucchini have flowers, even the cantaloupe are starting to perk up now that the weather is warmer.
B00004RA48 This is my second germination set I've ordered in the last two weeks.  This one is even flimsier than the other one by Hydrofarms.  However, the concept works:  place peat pots of seeds in a warm, humid environment and seeds will sprout.  I have mine on a heating pad under a grow lamp.  The peat pots only expanded to just under an inch.An aluminum pan with a clear lid would work just as well, as the metal would distribute the heat better.  I found the lid popped off easily so I check on it several times a day.  I have beans and turnips growing in my peat pots.With care I intend to reuse the pan and lid for multiple uses.  For new gardeners this is an effective way to grow seeds.  I could also place peat pots in sealed plastic bags for cheaper, though. I will report back in a week when the first seeds sprout.
B00004RA48 This is a decent item, but a little flimsy. The holder does not hold the soil discs well and the plastic container bends very easily making it hard to mve without caution. It gets the job done, is a good price, but I might try a different brand next to see if it is sturdier.
B00004RA48 You can't beat the price for this kit and it's so easy to start seeds. I used this for the first time last year and followed planting and disk instructions and had over a 75% germination rate! Between the cost and ease-of-use, this is a great way to start seeds for outdoors. Just keep the little pellets moist and you'll be good to go.Some seeds need dark to germinate, so make sure to read your seed packets!
B00004RA48 I've used this and a few other similar Jiffy products the last several years to start seeds for my garden. They are very easy to use (add hot water per the directions to expand the included pellets, then plant seeds per packet instructions) and less messy than using seed starting mix in flats--and perhaps even easier as well, though probably a bit more expensive. A clear plastic cover/dome is included to help germination. When the seedlings are ready to pot up or transplant, the netting tears off very easily and allows for transplanting with minimal root disturbance. Some people also leave the netting on and I seem to remember reading that it's supposed to disintegrate, but that hasn't been my experience. You do have to be careful with larger-rooted plants (squash, etc.) that you take care of them before their roots start to grow through the netting, otherwise you'll probably shock them more if/when you remove it. Finally, I like the square shape of this tray because it allows me to evenly rotate the plants under my grow lights.However, there are a few things you should know that don't seem to be made clear. Jiffy sells refill pellets so you can use the tray again, ideally saving money--but they have several similar-looking products that take different-sized pellets, so you need to know which ones you need. This 25-cell tray takes 42mm pellets (not 30, 36, or 50mm, which they also sell). Jiffy sells the 25-pack ofJiffy 5777 Refills, which are the right size. They used to be almost as expensive on Amazon as this complete kit, but as of my writing they are now an add-on item for about half the cost. Beware of third-party sellers; for example, I see a 200-pack of supposedly 42mm pellets,Jiffy 7 Peat Soil 42mm Pellets, but they were actually the wrong size, so I had to return them. You may also be able to find them locally. Just be sure you get the right size, which is the 42mm size, sold under the \"Jiffy 5777\" name. Jiffy does not make sizing clear on either the original product or the refill, both of which would be a great help.Finally, I will note that because of the availability of refills, I was hoping to save money by re-using the tray for a few years and just replacing the pellets. However, after saving two trays from last season (both inside under good, climate-controlled conditions), one became slightly warped and curled up towards the outside, making it undesirable for use since I'm not sure if my plants would fall over with this slight curl of the tray. It also developed a small crack in the bottom, which is important to be aware of if you're using (and watering) these inside as I assume most people do. Obviously, these are just thin plastic and not something I'd expect to keep for years and years, but I was hoping to at least get a couple years' use out them. This works better sometimes than others.In summary, I've used this product for a couple years now, and it's definitely become my favorite method for most plants. I plan to continue to use this product for as long as it's available--just be warned about refill sizes, and perhaps be careful about how the tray is stored if you're hoping to re-use it for the next season.
B00004RA4G In theory, this should work. I don't like how you can't see if there is anything in it. It sometimes will get knocked down so will look like its trigger and there's no real way to tell without opening it. This morning trap was knocked down, and I walked it all the way out into the wood to release oocupant only to discover it was empty.This trap might work okay, but I think the mouse cubes are alot better.
B00004RA4G A family of field mice moved into the house.  They are soooo tiny I wasn't sure what trap to use but this looked the lightest.  I caught the whole family within a few hours - even the babies. The secret as many have already said is keep in in their path and along the wall - I knew where they were coming from so it made that part easy.  Also, like already mentioned - just a dap of peanut butter - especially if trying to catch small mice.
B00004RA4G Recently I've been researching mice and other vermin as they pertain to farmstead habitation.Knowing that they must be removed from chicken coops and feed storage areas, it's nice to have options that do not require poison, nor snap a mouse/vole/rat to death and leave it for animals to pick at and possibly get sick from.Your cat, dog and other pets may get access to dead animals in traditional traps, so these enclosed live catch traps seemed like a great idea.I purchased four and placed them on a shelf where mouse droppings were noted.  I also places a motion activated camera so I could better see how they were or were not being trapped by the device.Within one 24 hour period, three out of four traps placed were tripped with nothing at all inside.  Upon video and still image review, a Deer Mouse had trotted over the top of the three traps that were tripped and of course activated them without being inside.The third trap remained unsprung, but the Deer Mouse only sniffed the opening and failed to enter.With all four traps re-set for another go, the Deer Mouse now just scampers around each trap and doesn't bother with them at all.I have added a photo of the setup and mouse to the collection of photos submitted by buyers/reviewers.I like the idea of the tilt trap and in theory it's great, in practical use it's simply not effective.  There are many solutions to this problem:The most popular is to simply put a cardboard box over the tilted UP end, through a hole that is cut just slightly taller than the trap at the fulcrum.  This allows the trap to activate, but does not allow the mouse to stand ON the tipped up section.  As this is an innovation which isn't already a part of the trap, I am giving my two star rating on the traps as designed.It also wouldn't hurt to make them larger with an adjustable balance weight... the buyer can of course make any number of modifications and the system is already being copied and improved by other companies... I guess this is an example of another weak patent registration process.So, I sadly would not recommend these to friends and others wanting to rid themselves of mice quickly.... but IF you enjoy the process of problem solving and using these as a starting point, you will certainly foil the mice and end up collecting them in short order.Look for the design which has a housing over the tipped up portion... it's better.
B00004RA4G We have several traps to deal with the mice that love our garage - this trap works well, but the one improvement would be to have the case transparent so you can see the contents.  When the mouse goes in, the trap rocks and the door closes and latches - this all works well, but the trap frequently closes without a mouse.
B00004RA4G I read the negative reviews and bought the trap anyway because I wanted a humane trap; just couldn't bring myself to kill the one mouse that seemed to have snuck into my house.  I posted a picture; the trap is smaller than a dollar bill.  I found that I was \"waiting up\" and checking the mousetrap every half hour, because any mouse that it caught would certainly die rather quickly in there.  A traditional mouse trap would be more humane if one couldn't release the catch within minutes of a trap.  I never did catch a mouse with it; I grew tired of checking the thing too often...I wish the trap were just a little bit bigger... but as it is, it is too small for a mouse to live for more than a few minutes.
B00004RA4G Having read reviews of several different live traps, had no idea which was best.  So, bought about 4 different ones.  THIS ONE WORKED.  Put them all out with peanut butter and had no sign of any activity except this one.  Didn't know how many mice we had, but caught three with this one and zero with the others and no escapes, it seems, from the others.  They were all put in the same general area.  This one worked, was easy to set, easy to bait and easy to release the mouse.
B00004RA4G This works well, but you cannot tell if it just tripped or if caught any.Sometimes it is tripped empty and that locks the door so it has to be reset before it can catch again. On the other hand, this is really low-cost and you can buy a lot more.
B00004RA81 This chain fit great for my Poulan Pro electric saw. This is also an older company that has a great website to help identify exactly what model your specific saw requires. It is not directional, so you don't have to worry about any arrows facing the right way. I just used it and I forgot how powerful my saw was. Getting old ones sharpened can be questionable when new ones are this cheap.
B00004RA81 I HAVE A 18\" CRAFTSMAN CHAIN SAW THAT CAME WITH A OREGON CHAIN THAT I HIT DIRT AND DULLED IT REAL FAST.THIS REPLACEMENT CHAIN FITS AND WORKS JUST AS WELL AS THE ONE IT CAME WITH AND IS ALSO HALF THE PRICE OF SEARS.
B00004RA81 This chain fit my Poulan 18&#34; chainsaw perfectly and was wicked sharp. The price was just a fraction of what I would have paid at a hardware or Tractor Supply store.
B00004RA81 as advertised..... Oregon Chainsaw always delivers a good product. I've bought lots of their chainsaw chains over the years and haven't ever been disappointed with the quality...... good product..........
B00004RA81 Nice quality replacement chain and fit perfectly. Seems to hold its sharpness better than the chain that came with the saw. I find it less trouble to just replace the chain rather than try to sharpen them.
B00004RA81 It was half the price of the same chain at Sears and came in two days. It saved me a ride and I have a pile of wood.
B00004RA82 Bought two for different chainsaw models and am pleased with the quality of the chains.Sharp as new!Excellent price. Just be sure your chainsaw is compatible!
B00004RA82 I switched from a skip tooth chain to this semi chisel and it cuts much faster and less vibration. On my 40 volt electric saw it really makes a difference.
B00004RA82 I buy these chains at my local hardware store for about the same price as Amazon charges. They work perfectly for my Husqvarna chain saw. Be careful to make sure you get the correct chain. There are many different variations on 16\" chains, and just knowing the brand of the saw doesn't tell you which will be the correct one.
B00004RA82 This S56 chain fits my Makita UC4030A electric chain saw. Price is cheaper than Home depot by about 6 dollars. At this price I will keep a few on hand and sharpen them later. Oregon's web site lists what chains fit which saws.
B00004RA82 Do not assume from this listing that the S56 16-inch saw chain will fit your 16-inch saw!!  If a photo of the back of the package were also included in this listing, you could zoom in and verify which models of the brands listed on the front view it will actually fit (Well Duh!!).  Additionally, while listings for some other Oregon chains advise we use the selector guide found at Oregonchain.com, most do not!  Oregon makes an excellent saw chain. Each and every listing should prominently provide explicit instruction that potential buyers need to first verify the correct selection for their particular make & model, before ordering.  Do they look at all those questions customers post (will this fit my xxx model of my xxx brand)?My father's Remington 16-inch electric, Model 1630A actually requires the S58, even though entering that make and model into Amazon's Search field brought us directly to this listing.  Unfortunately, we only discovered the mismatch when our shipment arrived and we found that it was not listed on the back of the carton containing the chain.  A visit to the Oregon website (also suggested on the carton but nowhere in this listing) revealed that the S58 is the correct choice.....even though the description and photo of the S58 at Amazon states \"Fits Echo, John Deere and Sears Chain Saws\" with no reference to Remington!!! The Amazon listing for S58 contained an advisory to first check the selector guide at Oregon.  That advisory is not included on this listing!  So, it did not do me much good to shop on Amazon versus visiting the local \"big box store\" when their listing resulted in the shipment & my return of the wrong product!  Are you going to reimburse my time/$$ to return 3 chains?  Come on guys!  Do you really monitor the responses to your \"Did we miss anything?\" links?UPDATE  (12.7.2013): Well!  I have already heard back on my return (it really pays to use the \"return function\" that can be found under your \"orders history\")and have received a complete refund!!  The email reply also promised this issue would be forwarded through channels.  Hopefully, this will result in a hyperlink being inserted below, with an advisory to first verify exactly which chain fits your saw make and model.  BIG TIP NOT EMPHASIZED ENOUGH EVEN AT THE SELECTOR SITE:  \"count the number of drive links in the chain you have now, and write that number down someplace where you can find it\".  S56 chain has 56 drive links while S58 (and our Remington's old chain)has 58!!I my case, the selector guide gave 4 different alternatives of 58 drive link chains for the electric saw we use behind the garage to cut up wood for splitting.  Since I have years of seasonal experience, and use a large, gas-powered, chain saw with an aggressive style of Oregon chain to fell and section trees in the woods, we chose the aggressive style chain (WARNING: this = \"far greater chance for kick-back and IS NOT for the unwary user\") which was also available at Amazon.com (not the S58 but the 91VXL058G).Lastly, this disappointment is one of the very few I have experienced in my many years and many $$ spent as a customer of Amazon. I use Oregon chains on my big Stihl saw, and have found that they cut a long time before dulling, and can be filed or re-sharpened many times over.  Recommend them highly.PS to the guy with the Poulan Pro...OMG!!!  For kicks and giggles, I looked up your saw on the selector guide.  There were some 15 or more choices and some were 56 link and others 58 link.  Yours is the best example I can see, where knowing to count drive links on the current chain is soooooooo important.
B00004RA8P I've owned two of these feeders and my only complaint with the first one is that the yellow &#34;flowers&#34; come out too easily and get lost.  This resulted in wasps, bees, etc being able to drink the liquid.  I had used it a few years and am supposing they aren't meant to last that long.I bought another one just like it and have had no issues so far.  Otherwise, great feeder with large capacity.  It is very heavy, so I suggest hanging from your porch or a limb.
B00004RA8P I don't have any problems with this and neither do the birds. We fill it with a sugar/water mix rather than feeding the poor little critters a load of crummy additives, they really don't care that the water isn't red and the artificial coloring is suspected of giving them health issues.Anyway, I just unscrew it from the cap when I want to clean and fill it, then empty any remaining solution down the drain in the yard and wash it off with the hose before taking it indoors (sugar water really attracts dirt in a carpet, ask me how I know).I have not found it difficult to clean. Once refilled I take it out again, still upside down, and then turn it over before anything significant can leak out. Then just screw it back in to the cap.

B00004RA8P We have  been feeding hummingbirds on our mountain in North Carolina for years now. The hummers have 2 clutches a year and, by late in the season, we will have 30 or 40 of them circling the feeders, claiming their territory and buzzing each other in some mock \"hummingbird wars\".  In August, we will empty one of these in a day, so we have to have multiple feeders to keep up.  This is the feeder we have always bought and they are pretty durable but once in a while a black bear will wear one out for us-so we keep a couple extra.  The feeder hangs on a piece of electrical wire that goes under the lid on top and the other end gets bent into a loop to hang on the hook.  But now they have decided to shorten the wire until it is just a few inches long after making the loop and tying the knot under the lid. I know the company must have saved about a penny on the wire length but it doesn't work for us now - I have to use a 2-step ladder to hang it.  So, I'm off to the home store to try to find some red electrical wire that I can use to replace the one that is way too short.Beyond that, this is the feeder to use.  The glass jar cleans easily with a jar brush and the yellow flowers at the bottom pop out so you can reach in with an old toothbrush to clean the inside. The 6 positions works way better than the 4 place feeders for us due to the number of hummingbirds that are trying to feed simultaneously.  Just giving it 3 stars - hoping the company rethink their board-room decision on the attachment wire.
B00004RA8P I've gone through so many hummingbird feeders that the hummingbirds have stopped being cautious when a new one appears.  I've tried decorative blown-glass ones, lightweight plastics ones, and glass/plastic combo ones manufactured by various companies, including Garden Treasures and this one, Perky Pets.  I've tried models with built-in ant moats and others with bee guards.  If I could keep away ants, then I couldn't dissuade the bees.  And ultimately, each model either leaked or crashed to the ground due to the included but inadequate hanging methods.  Finally, however, I think I've found The One, although I combine it with theNectar Protectorto keep ants away -- more on that later.First the details:  the 30-ounce glass bottle holds a lot of nectar, far more than my single family of hummingbirds (now four in all) can consume in a week, the maximum amount of time you should leave a batch of nectar outside.  Its size, however, gives it some heft and a wider opening in the jar to aid in cleaning.  The single-piece plastic base has six, yellow-flowered ports that are too small for bees to enter and a perch that circles it.  It comes with a short piece of red-plastic wire for hanging.  It does not have a built-in ant moat or anything else to dissuade those pests.The base will not leak, as many other models do, because it is constructed of a single piece of molded plastic.  The disadvantage of that is, of course, that you cannot get inside of it to clean.  I've found that if I change the nectar twice a week -- or even, in rare cases, only once -- and rinse out the feeder thoroughly before refilling, the inside remains clean and mold-free.  I also have a set ofDroll Yankees PLB Perfect Little Brushesto clean out the ports.  Like many hummingbird feeders, this one only addresses one pest problem, bees, so you'll probably want to get a separate ant-guard.  Because this feeder hangs with a wire, which I twist several times around itself to keep it from undoing, I have to attach it more or less permanently to the ant-moat above it, making it necessary to remove both, as a single unit, when refilling.  Also, when you tip it upside down to unscrew/empty it, you'll get sugar water on your hands and on the ground, so do it in a location where it doesn't matter.  To continue keeping bees away, make sure you also rinse the outside since the dried sugar will attract them.I do not use colored nectar and instead make my own clear version (4 parts water, boiled, to 1 part sugar).  There is enough red on the feeder to attract the hummingbirds without using colored nectar.I'm giving this feeder five stars because it's the best I've encountered after eight or so attempts.  It's not perfect, but it's darn close.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann
B00004RA8P I am using this with the Audubon Hummingbird Food packets. It is easy to assemble and disassemble for cleaning. I am in a serious competition in my neighborhood with many hummingbird feeders and mine is quite popular. We can sit on our deck and within a few feet the hummers come and feed and are interested only in that and hassling each other.
B00004RA8P This product is well made and works well; however attempting to clean both the bottle and the base is very difficult. The base is sealed and with many small hard to reach spaces inside I can't see how it can be cleaned. The neck of the bottle is very narrow. Even with a bottle brush it's hard to reach all the area inside.
B00004RA8P THEY LOVE THIS ONE. IT'S THE CADILAC OF FEEDERS. IF MOLD BUILDS UP IN THE GLASS JUST FILL WITH DILUTE CLORINE BLEACH AND LET STAND FOR A FEW HOURS. IT WILL CLEAN IT UP.AND WHEN YOU FILL IT TRY AND STAND VERY STILL BY THE FEEDER AND YOU CAN OBSERVE THEM FROM ONLY INCHES AWAY. IF YOU DON'T MOVE, THEY CAN'T SEE YOU. BUT DON'T TOUCH. THEY'RE MUCH TOO FRAGILE.
B00004RA8P July 28, 2012 Update\"Talk about discrimination.  Our bunch so far this year has grown to 5 and they are just as much fun to watch as before.  This year they have their eyes and tastes set on the two Perky-Pets in the back yard and not so much on the front yard's other two feeders.  The key to this year's success for them and us is changing the solution every two or three days and putting fill the glass to about 1/4th full.  I am here to simply order two more.  I hope you enjoy yours as much as we enjoy ours.April 29, 2012:  They're back and still as beautiful as ever.  This year so far only two have shown up and I cannot determine their sex or anything.  They are still skittish and will not come to me as in the past.  It takes time.  They use these Perky-Pet 209s almost exclusively even though there are 2 other brands up.November 18, 2011:  Just a quick update.  The feeders are down, the hummers are on their way to Mexico and all is well.  After a full season of use and feeding a whole bunch of hummers I am happy to say these are the best of the best.  I usually changed the feeders every two to three days and have yet to have the first second of any problem except on some mornings the hummers would be a tad impatient with my schedule.  No leaks.  No broken roosts.  Nothing negative.  My homemade ant trap/chaser kept the glass clean on the inside.  I heard that a hand full of dried beans dropped in the glass and a few vigorous shakes would help keep the insides clean and it worked well.  Can't wait for springtime and their arrival.In recent years we have bought several feeders and this is the best yet.  We have had 4 to 5 feeding stations set up and the first one to empty is this and its twin even though one is out front and the others are in the back.  With all factors the same, i.e., sugar water in a glass container this one just has more appeal and frankly I do not know why.  They will not tell me.  When it is empty they do let me know while I on the way to refill it that it sure took me long enough to get there.  I always alternate feeders and will set the empty on top of the trash can while installing the new batch of food.  When I put this one on the can they go to it even though the Brand X has food.  When I set the one with Brand X on the can they could not care less.  Right now our population has grown to about 6 but there is no way to be sure with all them mostly the same colors except the male ruby throated ones.  The like the perch better than the rest and even though the holes are the same as the others they just seem to enjoy sitting there taking a sip.  If simple, hour wasting watching appeals to anyone buy a feeder and check out several of the hummingbird websites for recipes and care.  We use 1 cup sugar to 4 cups boiled water cooled to room temperature.  The hummers are absolutely delightful and thank you Perky-Pet for the 209s.
B00004RA8P I bought 2 of these to replace 2 older Perky Pet, 4 flower models.  The old 4 flower model has a design flaw which sometimes led to dripping and also attracted ants and wasps.  The bottle is large but the plastic bottom holds a lot of fluid as well.  It is over-sized for our needs, so I just fill it with less food.  Perky Pet should consider creating a new model based on this design but smaller.If I had a complaint, it would be with the wire for hanging the feeder.  A great solution for me was using a wire coat hanger and with pliers, fashioned a loop at one end and making a square shape after passing the wire through the hole in the feeder top. It works great, the wire is the perfect diameter for the hole in the feeder and very strong for windy days!I should mention the packaging is poorly done but it wasn't a problem for me. I can imagine a case of these in a store sitting on a shelf, with customers reaching for a box could easily result in a few being broken, as the glass bottle can easily come out of the box.The price is excellent, highly recommended.Update 7-7-2010, Just bought my 3rd...
B00004RA8P I bought 2 different feeders at the same time and this one is holding up much much better. It is solid and easy to clean. I didn't use the wire that came with the feeder as it was too short. But I threaded a pipe cleaner through the top hole and it works great. The hummers love the feeder and I can see it lasting for many years to come.EDITING: I am going to have to lower my rating on this. The hummingbird feeder works fine. The issue is the yellow \"bee guards.\" Did you know that bees and wasps are attracted to the color yellow? So if these \"bee guards\" (dumb name...should be called bee attractors) were any color other than yellow...like RED...then I wouldn't have a nectar feeder in my yard right that I can't even get to because it has so many wasps and yellow jackets on it.one more issue. I woke up one morning to find all six yellow bee guards removed. We searched the grass below and found 3 of them. There were no gnaw marks, chew marks, bites or scratches anywhere on the nectar feeder or yellow plastic flowers. What removed them? I don't know. But now that they are gone, the wasps are actually able to crawl INSIDE the darn nectar reservoir. Like I said, this nectar feeder is all but useless and the moment I can actually remove it without getting attacked by flying insects, I will and never put it back up again.
B00004RA8P This is difficult to clean.
B00004RA8P It's spring and time to bring out the hummingbird feeder.  This is one of the most popular models and there are lots of reasons.  It's a simple design, has six feeding stations, has a shatterproof glass cylinder and holds a whopping 30 ounces!  I've never had a problem with ants climbing down the wire to the feeder (wires are better than string and hold up better in the wind).  Depending on how hungry your many hummingbirds are, the more you'll have to refill the syrup.  Perky-Pets 'high energy nectar' is good stuff, but seriously, a high concentration of sugar and red coloring does the trick.  Hummingbirds are attracted to the color red.To enhance your hummingbird traffic, supplement it with plants that look great.  The following are some of my favorites for various reasons:Butterfly Bush - comes in blue, ruby, pink and purple and attracts butterflies and hummingbirds.Bottlebrush - small evergreen tree or shrub.  Attracts hummingbirds, but can be messy with its flowers.Fuchsia - comes in bright red or purplish color and is great to hang next to your feeder and attracts hummingbirds.Morning Glory (vine) - multi-color attracts hummingbirds and grows quickly.Flowering red Currant - colorful background shrub that attracts hummingbirds, as well.Note that all these plants grow well in California, so check your local nursery for other suggestions.
B00004RA8P I like the product being glass and so do the hummers. It would be nice to see PP improve the rim or perch to a more durable one as it becomes flemsy and easily breaks away from the base over time. Also the the yellow ports should be changed to red so as to discourage bees.
B00004RA8P I swapped out my old plastic hummingbird feeders for this glass one because the plastic ones kept getting moldy and were so hard to clean. This feeder is way too large for my liking, you need a lot (tons!) of sugar syrup to fill it up. It also took a week for my hummingbirds to go near this feeder and even now it's their second choice to my other smaller feeder. I don't think they like the perches, as they loved my old feeders which didn't have perches. And I don't think they are very attracted to this feeder due to its flat yellow flowers, instead of the pretty raised ones you get on other feeders.
B00004RA8P Works as expected.  Attracts humming birds and others.  Decent value.  As stated in many reviews needs a hook system and requires you to figure that out.
B00004RA9A Purchased these replacement yellow bee guards (which differ in shape from the image on the Amazon site &#8211; the guards now have a semi-globe shape), because I have the careless habit to walk out of the house and walk across the lawn, with a newly cleaned and filled hummingbird feeder held upside down.  On occasion, after a forgetful moment, I re-install the freshly cleaned bee guards before I reach the hummingbird location.  Once in a while, the bee guards have dropped out (and customarily I located them again.)  The last time I didn&#8217;t.  Long story, irrelevant to the product review, I just realize.  Be it as it may, I have no issues with the bee guards, nor (more importantly) do the hummingbirds.  This past season, the guards functioned flawlessly, to the delight of our hummingbird population (and frustration of the yellow-jackets.)  The only time (no joke) the bee guards didn&#8217;t &#8216;make it&#8217;, was when a black bear roamed the property and totally demolished all of our hummingbird feeders (no joke &#8230;)  I don&#8217;t expect Perky-Pet to take that into consideration (sarcasm.)
B00004RA9A These guards look like they would work well to deter bees.  However they do not fit most of our feeders.
B00004RA9A The bee guards worked great but the reason I gave it only three stars is the price. Over a buck a piece is more than it should be in my option. If it wasn't a gift to my dad who enjoys his hummingbirds I would have kept looking for a cheaper place to purchase them.
B00004RA9A Tthese little gems are O.K. and do work well to keep bees of most kinds out of the nectar; however, there is just no humane way to rid one's yard of bees.  Even though bees are a pain and create a problem for some hummingbirds these guards manage to keep the bees at bay.  Our hummers just look at the bees gathered around the guards and laugh at them while eating the nectar.  Typical of most predators the bees attempt to chase the birds but success falls to the birds.One minor problem with the guards is that some insects are small enough to enter the mesh but too stupid to figure a way out and thusly meet their demise.  When cleaning the mesh of the guards be sure to clean the inside as well.
B00004RA9A These did not fit my feeder, but I super-glued them in place. The \"basket\" part also falls off of the \"stem\" part ...but I super-glued them in place. The bees will find any small place not covered by glue, so if you try this work-around, be sure to put it on thick...a gel works best. I secured with masking tape to let it dry, too.I like feeding bees, and they have their own plate of sugar water, but I also want my hummingbirds happy. I also hate it when the bees get carried away and drown themselves. Trying to get them out while they are still alive is tricky, although they don't sting when wet with sugar water. This is helping.Today, a new problem: my tall dog can reach the feeder with his nose and is tipping it to drink from it, bees and all. These guards won't solve all problems, I guess!
B00004RA9A For the appropriate hummingbird feeder(s), these little guards are a &#34;must have&#34; if you are going to keeps bees and other insects from seriously messing up your feeders.
B00004RACK My order arrived promptly and in perfect condition. Excellent packaging!Quality of Gauge was evident -- solid brass fittings, clear 0-200 lb. increments and metric scale (atmospheres).A special Flat Rubber Washer (included) prevents leaks and helps keep water out of the housing. BE SURE the flat rubber washer is in place and fitting is tight to the spigot or manifold before water is turned on !! Don't dare lose that Flat Washer, 'cause a regular Hose Washer won't work !!IF you have installed the Flat Washer and tightened the Fitting properly before turning on the water -- and you see water inside the gauge, turn it off and SEND IT BACK as defective. Amazon's Returns Policy is the best in the on-line retail business, so it's a hassle-free deal to get an exchange or refund.Good Luck !!
B00004RACK This pressure gauge was almost half the price the one from home depot, but so much nicer - solid construction and does not leak. Seems to be accurate too.
B00004RACK This is a great little item to have when traveling from place to place.  I have a regulator on my hose but it is nice to know what the water pressure is  in cases where I had to take my regulator off to service it.  Gives one a little peace of mind so you don't worry about blowing your lines.
B00004RACK Attaches to any regular outside spicket or your washing machine line.  Seems to read ok, but I'm not 100% sure because I do not have anything to compare it too.  I think it would be beneficial to have a professional with professional tools measure the pressure as well to ensure the most accurate reading.The one negative I have is that the gauge fills up with water under the glass.  I'm not sure if mine is defective or if they are all that way, but I would think the water should not seep in like that.
B00004RACK If you are going to install a sprinkler system than you will need to know your PSI. This does a great job at letting me know where I stand. Now I can plan out my system.
B00004RACK This was purchased to measure my water pressure so that I know what the psi in order to install a back yard irrigation system.  This gave me an idea on what to spec out during the purchasing of sprinkler equipment.  The gauge is made of metal and can be screwed into your garden bib or faucet.
B00004RAGL I needed a relatively short garden hose and this APEX REM 15-foot hose fit the bill at a reasonable price. This Amazon item sells various remnants (i.e. left-overs from longer hoses) so what you get is not necessarily matches the stock photo. I am attaching a photo (under customer photos) of the hose I received - a green light-duty 3-ply hose. It looks just like many longer hoses I bought a local home improvement store. It is 15-feet by 5/8 inches. The hose is reinforced and comes with standard brass couplings. The couplings made good connections and do not leak even without Teflon tape.The hose came tightly wrapped which caused some kinks in the hose - I highlighted two of them in the attached photo. However, after several days in the sun with water running through the hose the kinks are working themselves out and the water flow is not impeded significantly.Overall, I am pleased with this purchase.Ali Julia review
B00004RAGL Hose remnants at the local big hardware stores are insanely priced.Not so with this unit! Great price and solid quality!
B00004RAGL This is a very well made product and is a good length for connecting portable hose reels to the spigot. I will buy this product again when needed.
B00004RAGL I purchased three of these via Amazon (free delivery) for $8 each and back for more. Great value! I use them in combination with a 4 way connector set and adjustable sprinklers to water each of my raised garden beds with just one quick turn of the hose. Not only are they a much better quality than the sets supposedly created to do the same thing but the price is competitive too. Just the right size to daisy chain sprinklers and reduces the time required to tend the garden...perfect for raised garden beds where regular sprinkler system might be over-kill.UPDATE - I noticed many people complaining over quality...for the record I received the Black hose remnants as pictured. From the sound of it, there are various colors and quality issues. The black ones are very good quality with brass fittings.
B00004RAGL i guess for the price all you can ask is that it works but barely. hose kinks very easy disrupting water flow and leaks where connected to the spicket, but water does get from point a to point b so i cant give it one star.
B00004RAGL Our 50-foot Gilmour hose was just slightly too short to reach the garden, so I picked up this \"remnant\" for those additional couple of feet - it works like a charm.  Pretty good price.  Not the highest quality hose out there (thin, rubbery and could kink), but is perfect for my use and great VALUE.  The one I got was just like the picture - black in color.
B00004RAGL I read the other reviewers who had similar problems before I bought this.  I also read the reviews raving about this hose.  Since these hoses are maid from remnants; I suppose its a matter of luck as to which hose you get.  My luck wasn't good.  The hose had permanent kinks and the vinyl skin had bubbles where it was separating from the hose.Returned it immediately.
B00004RAGL For a reasonable price these remnants proved fine for extending one pesky hose that was just a little bit too short.
B00004RAGL This is a short piece of hose.  It may not be the colour shown, so don't buy it if you're using it for decorative purposes.  If you want it to function, it will.Yes, it has a plastic washer instead of rubber.  If you would happen to have a leaking problem, just add some teflon tape (which you should be doing to all your pressurized hose joints anyway as a precautionary measure) - it only costs a few cents a roll.As this is the cheapest such item to serve its purpose, it gets my recommendation.[Mine is red and green, apparently for Christmas].
B00004RAGL I bought this to relocate my hose reel in the backyard, and it has proven to be a decent buy. I have had no issues with leaking, and that's all that I can really ask for here.
B00004RAGL Use these to hook up various pvc connections in my garder watering system.  Great length and price on these remnant hoses.
B00004RAGL This was a recommended addition to my purchase of the \"Frigidaire FAD704DWD Energy Star 70-pint Dehumidifier\".  I use a gravity drain to a French Drain in the basement.  The dehumidifier is about 10' from a hole into the drain and this hose did the job nicely.  It comes rolled up and I had to run hot water thru it and then lay it out on the blacktop driveway in the hot sun to get it to lay straight.
B00004RAL9 I used this in the shower because it is a tough brush for skin, but don't use it on sensitive areas because it is a strong wire which can damage the pores of vital areas if you know what I mean.
B00004RAL9 I used this in the shower because it is a tough brush for skin, but don't use it on sensitive areas because it is a strong wire which can damage the pores of vital areas if you know what I mean.
B00004RAL9 Absolutely the best brush I've used.  The brush head doesn't go flat like others I've used and it does a great job at keeping my Weber clean.
B00004RAL9 As grill brushes go, this is pretty nice. The extra-long handle is great for doing a burn-off cleaning, and the metal clip is perfect for cleaning off the cast-iron grills available on the Genesis.Amazon's price is also 50% less than every store I've seen this at (Sears, True Value, etc.), so I may pick up a couple more as spares.
B00004RAL9 I've had the same brush for 4 years now. This brush is great. The wooden handle is sturdy, doesn't heat up, and is long enough that you can clean your grill while it's hot (how I usually do it) My one complaint with it is since there is no angle at the head, you end up putting the brush at an angle (since you can't hold it perpendicular to the grill as that would defeat the point of the 18\" handle) which means only the bristles at the very front get used. My brush has the front brass bristles worn down and full of grill gunk but 2/3rds of the bristles in the back look brand new. If the head of the brush was at an angle to the handle this brush would be way better.That said, it's still a good brush.Be careful though as it seems Amazon is combining the reviews between the version of this brush that has brass bristles with the version with steel bristles.
B00004RAL9 Before, when I went to buy a new brush I would always get the cheapies; I thought they were all the same, except some came in plastic while others came in wood or aluminum. I was wrong. You do get what you pay for when buying a grill brush, so buy this one! The bristles are stiff enough to clean up all the grit, yet soft enough to not damage your grate. The brush feels nice and sturdy, it feels well built. Also, this brush has a handy scraper on the end which is extremely handy with the really tough crusties (on your GRILL silly).
B00004RALJ Bought this specifically for tailgaiting and it was perfect. We made sliders then made hot dogs and it cooked very well. Nothing but the best from weber!
B00004RALJ I bought this grill primarily for when we go camping. This grills is ultraportable and it's a Weber so it will last.priced right with free shipping is a winner in my book!
B00004RALJ There is plenty of grill space to hamburgers, hotdogs, chicken, steaks or shrimp kabobs. Easy to regulate the heat using the vents.  Love that the lid can hang on the grill to block the wind or just rest there while flipping your food....frees both hands!
B00004RALJ We love charcoal, we just do!  This little grill is good for our camper and the bottom feet fold up to hold the top on while in transit.  I love Weber, and this is a winner.
B00004RALJ Bought it for camping and it is perfect.  The legs hold the lid down for transport.  And it has Weber quality construction.  Love it.
B00004RALL For years, I've been using a larger 22\" weber grill, but when I moved recently I decided to get one a bit smaller to conserve charcoal.  After doing quite a bit of research and reading reviews, I decided to go with this Smokey Joe Silver.  It is absolutely unbeatable, and I would have paid double for it without blinking an eye!  While it doesn't have an adjustable-height grilling surface, it's quite easy to properly place the charcoal in such a way that you get exactly the heat you're looking for.  I've been able to sear fish, or slow-cook buffalo wings, just by estimating the charcoal amount and placement.  I should also note that I usually use the lump type charcoal, not briquettes, and both work equally well in this grill.  Cleaning is a breeze, and so far after using it 12+ times since I got it a couple weeks ago, hasn't even come close to needing it.As far as build quality goes, I really like the solid feel of the gr
B00004RALL In my opinion and as well as thousands of other Weber owners, this is a great product. I have had 3 or 4 of these little units that I just leave behind and have never had a problem with one.
B00004RALL Probably the best grill for this price range! Got one for my parents and compares well with my Weber 18\" for grilling! My only nit pick are the legs! You may have to tighten them down from time to time to keep the wobble out! But, back to grilling! This is one nice little unit, burgers and steaks cook up quite nicely! The secret is knowing how to use the upper and lower vents for heat and smoke adjustments! Once you have that down, you can whip up some serious munch with this puppy! Have done some excellent k-bob's and burgers and steaks have come out just as nicely! Have used Webers hickory chips for smoked meats and the flavor was delicious!After each use, clean out ashes and you will have consistant bbq! Put a piece of aluminum foil in the ash pan to catch the ashes! Wrap it up and dispose of neatly. To  help season the upper and lower grills and get rid of that metal taste and smell, I placed the grills in my oven! Preheated to 325 degs. and baked for about an hour! House stunk like hot steel for awhile, but no metal taste, the first time I used this grill!
B00004RALL The grill appears to be of good quality but the assembly instructions don't match the parts that were shipped. The instructions show how to attach the air vent which comes attached with a rivet from the factory. There are more parts than are needed. You can assemble it! but you will be confused. End product is satisfactory. Why do they call it the Smokey Joe Silver when it is black? Poor choice of names.
B00004RALL Ive had this same grill for about 8 years now and its as nice now as the day I got it. Its big enough to cook pretty much whatever you need to cook on it, of course if you have a lot to cook it may take a little longer. Ive always had everything cook very evenly with more than sufficient burn time with coals. This grill is also small enough that you can take it with you for camping or going on your boat for a bbq on the beach (I just use a bungy cord to secure the lid) . If I need to rid of the coals I just put water on them turn the grill upside down and cover the coals in dirt, if the grill is still hot ill throw some more water on it then wipe it down and off we go..This grill isnt heavy so you can easily dump out the ashes in your trash can or where ever with minimal effort. Very great grill for the price and perfect for pretty much anyone!
B00004RALL I bought my first Smokey Joe in 1992.  I am finally replacing him... not because he wore out, but because I tore him apart to use the pieces for something very important.  (It's a long story... Smokey Joe was all I had or I would have been outside all night in my car).  Anyway, I am now replacing my first SJ with another.  I'm quite certain he will be chillin' and grillin' with me for the rest of my life.
B00004RALL The Weber Smokey Joe is a great portable grill as far as cooking quality is concerned but there are a few issues.First the good. You get a decent size grill area for an ultra-portable grill. It measures at 14 1/2 inches in diameter. Sure you probably can't do much with this grill if you are cooking indirect, but that's not what this grill is meant for. The grill cooks much like it's larger cousin - the Weber One-Touch. The porcelain enamel coating helps prevent rust. There's a vent damper on the bottom of the grill (as well as the top) so it's quite easy to control your temperature, much better then any other portable grill I've owned anyways. The ash-catcher works well enough to keep hot pieces of ember from falling to the ground.As I mentioned before, there are a few caveats. My main complaint is that this grill has no lid-lock. This makes transportation a bit cumbersome, especially for a grill that is meant to be portable. You have to buy the Gold or Platinum version to get this functionality. I believe all portable grills should be easy to transport. I use a couple bungee cords to lock my lid down during transportation. Another small issue I had with mine is that one of the legs is a bit shorter then the other two, so my grill doesn't sit as evenly as it should. This isn't a big deal because Weber has great customer service, it's not that big of a deal anyways, it's just a little off. Finally the top grate doesn't fit very tightly so it wobbles around a bit - again a small issue. One other thing I should mention is that even though it has an ash catcher, it doesn't have any sort of One-Touch type of system, so you have to dump it to clean it (the vent damper doesn't quite do it).  This isn't an issue at all for me because it's very light and easy to clean anyways but I thought I would mention that for those that might be curious.All in all this is a great portable grill. For my wife and I this is a great grill to use even when we aren't going anywhere because it needs so little charcoal. Cooking on this grill definitely feels like I'm grilling on a baby version of my One-Touch. There are a few issues that keep this grill from getting a perfect score, but don't let these small issues keep you from buying this great grill. Personally I believe it's worth the $5.00 to go ahead and upgrade to the Gold so you can have the lid-lock, but it's not essential, like I said before a couple bungee cords do the trick if you need that functionality. Happy grilling!
B00004RALL I see some reviews state that this is just a smaller version of the larger kettle grills&#8230; and that&#8217;s not quite true. This one is not portable unless you grab the whole grill&#8230; there&#8217;s no way to pick up the whole unit by the handle. The kettles have a handle and wheels so you can roll it around&#8230;once lit this unit isn&#8217;t going anywhere. Also, there&#8217;s no place to put the lid once it&#8217;s removed&#8230; the kettles have a hook so you can hang the lid right on the kettle but all you can do with this one is lay it on a table or the ground. Other than that&#8230; it&#8217;s a perfect grill for the two of us, it&#8217;s easy to assemble, it&#8217;s built rugged and it&#8217;s easily worth 5-stars. I would have given it 4-stars had I not known beforehand that it cannot be moved with the handle&#8230; when it&#8217;s cold you can just throw a bungee cord on and you&#8217;re good to go.
B00004RALL Hurricane Irene was on its way and our gas grill was DOA. Thank goodness we have Amazon Prime, because I didn't think to order a grill until a few days before the storm; it arrived on Friday.  We lost power early Sunday morning and did not get it back until this Saturday.  There are only three of us, so this was just the right size for us -- you can fit three to four burgers on the grill at a time.  It was simple to put together and very easy to use -- just roll 4 or 5 sheets of newspaper loosely, place them in the bottom of the kettle, put in about 30 briquets in a pyramid shape, light the papers and the charcoal is ready to use in about 20 minutes.  Spread the charcoal out evenly  and place the grill in place and you are ready to go.  There's an instruction booklet included.  It was really a lifesaver this week and will be used regularly from now on.  It's easily portable for camping trips, too.
B00004RALL Am writing this while cooking some chicken on a WSJ i found last week in new condition for a Hamilton. Let me preface my comments by stating that I have a 22-inch Weber with hinged grate that I love.The WSJ is small, somewhat solidly constructed (mine, while unused, has rust rings around the handle welds that go through the cover - not good).However, most folks use this Weber as a portable grill. Weber, for gawd's sakes, incorporate some form of simple mechanism ON ALL MODELS to keep the lid on in order to use the carry handle! (i use a pair of bungees looped every 45 degrees).The stove's best feature, the ability to cook using fewer coals, is also its drawback. This stove is best suited for slow cooking, delicate kebabs, fish, hot dogs, and burgers - not for hot, quick searing and grilling of thick steaks.Other drawbacks are the vents, which do not (at least on my unit) rotate smoothly. And trying to adjust the bottom vent to control air flow will result in your burning the beegeebees out of your fingers - i suggest fireproof mitts handling this stove.Also, being lightweight, this stove can dramatically shift during your cooking session, resulting in the potential for spillage of hot coals - especially if used on a light platform to increase cooking height (cooking on the ground with this thing can be down, but for many folks, may be uncomfortable). I'd suggest at least some holes for securing the stove legs to a platform or a way to weigh down the legs?All in all, this stove is OK - it gets the job done. I like Weber products, even if some of the QC and build quality has gone downhill in the last 10 years.I hope to enjoy my WSJ for as many years as my 18-inch (given away), my 22-inch (8 years going strong), and newest acquistion, the Smokey Joe Silver.
B00004RALL You can tell these are quality grills; otherwise Weber wouldn't give these a 10 year warranty. My 20 year old Smokey Joe recently came to its demise and there was no doubt I'd purchase another. The only difference is they now have a nylon handle instead of a wooden handle. I keep mine outside on a patio 24/7/365 and it weathers the elements without covering it. I also use mine on an old metal wrought-iron table to make for safe grilling. This is the perfect size for 1-3 people.
B00004RALQ Okay, I'm an addict and this is actually my fourth Weber grill...I buy one every four to five years, use it often, treat it poorly, and when it starts to show signs of age, I simply spring for a new one. Until I discovered the Weber, I seldom even got a year out of my grills - so this is quite an improvement for me. The quality of the product, and the results I get, are topnotch, and today, I wouldn't consider any other brand (except maybe a built-in Hastings - but that's another animal altogether).I go back and forth between the 22.5 inch and the 26 inch version. The 26 is more expensive, but it offers quite a bit more cooking area. It also uses quite a bit more charcoal, and to my eyes, it doesn't heat quite as evenly. Instead, I've settled on the 22.5, and on those relatively rare occasions when I need more grilling area, I just run a second grill.One thing I especially like is that Weber is so popular, you can get replacement parts just about anywhere. It's nice to know that if I open the grill in the Springtime and the grates are all rusty, I can zip over to the local hardware store and probably find an exact replacement.This time I went for the blue version, but otherwise it's the same Weber I've come to love. Easy to clean, rugged - and it cooks as well as anything out there. I'm not a fan of gas grills...they simply don't seem to get hot enough for certain uses. But with the Weber and some quality charcoal and you're all set, no matter what's on the menu.Only very small complaint is that I've had some problems with the paint peeling off under the top cover. In the past, once I noticed this happening, I simply scrubbed all the loose paint off with a wire brush...curious to see if this one has the same problem.Really recommended!
B00004RALQ I'm not even sure where to start!  I've wanted to add a charcoal grill to my outdoor cooking fleet for many years just for those few times that I'd like to cook more naturally.  I've used this one 2 times so far and can't believe I've waited this long.  I think it's saved me over $1000 I was going to spend to replace my 10 yr old gas grill.This grill and a couple Weber accessories make charcoal grilling a breeze!  I haven't grilled with charcoal in years and obviously I had cheap junk for grills in the past.The quality of the grill is great, but I expected that.  I can see it lasting years and years as many others have attested to.  I'll easily use it even during the week when I don't have the time I thought it would take and thought gas was easier for.  The first use and trying to get used to charcoal again was almost a failure because I almost choked the heat down keeping the vents closed.  When I realized that the steaks slowed down cooking and the kettle top got wet from condensation it hit me that I had the vents closed thus the fire couldn't breath.  All I had to do was open the vents and 'viola, in no time the heat was back up and going strong with no other help from me, just air.Yesterday I outdid myself with ribs. Although I did cook them a little to high, they were the best I've ever done both falling off the bone and the best flavor I've ever gotten.  I was using Mesquite chips as well but I've done that on a gas grill and cooked twice as long and didn't get near the same results.  It's amazing how the kettle makes all the difference in the world keeping the charcoal hot and lasting a long time.  I'm amazed!Clean up is much easier than I expected.  The ash catcher is awesome, even in high gusty winds.  Access though the grill for adding fuel makes adding briquettes and wood a breeze.Assembly was easy and took less than 20 minutes taking my time.The only con I can come up with was that on the top handle, it came out of the undamaged box with a chip of the porcelain coming off as if it had been hit.  It's small and by the handle and not exposing the metal so it's not a functional problem but with the box arriving in perfect condition, it's obvious it happened before being packed.  However, I'd be surprised if anyone could find it.All I can say is that I'm sold!!  Everything Weber that I've bought, from the grill to the accessories, have been top notch. Charcoal grilling is now a breeze and so much better than gas.  The old saying is absolutely true; having the right tools make all the difference in the world.  The Weber Kettle is absolutely the right tool!!  Being made in the USA is the cherry on top!To address some of the complaints in the lesser ratings:The handles don't get hot.  As hot as mine has been, the handles are easy to hold with bare hands, although I tend to use a mitt around a grill.  The new handles should last in any weather condition and much longer than wood as well.It would be nice to have a temp gauge but that's not hard to add if you really need one.  I can see the benefit but it's limited.The Kettle is not unstable if it's put together right.  If it falls apart after assembling, the legs aren't being secured fully as they should be, which is to tap them all the way in.  Rolling it isn't a problem but like with most anything, you have to be careful.  Depending on which way you roll it, one might be able to knock it over if not careful, but I've not found that to be easy to do.  Standing, it's as stable as can be.  Again, if it's wobbly or falls apart as one has claimed, the legs were not assembled properly.The lid DOES have a hook to hang on the side of the kettle; it's on the underside of the top near the vent.  It hangs nicely on the side of the kettle.
B00004RALQ We have a similar model One Touch Premium home (Germany) and the quality of Weber pays off. I brought the old chinese bbq to trash today ;-).The Weber is very solid build and comes ready to go with drop pans and charcoal holders (wires). Bought a chimney from Weber since the reviews were so good. Tried direct and indirect, keep on training.Will not to back to chinese quality again.Since we live in Northern Germany usage of this bbq is limited to summer time, completed with a Q200 grill.
B00004RALQ Our gas grill finally rusted out after 15 years. I was ready to spend $700 on the 320 but started asking myself why? Grilling outside is for leisure, take your time, relax and enjoy the flavor. So I opted for this Weber One Touch Gold - what I have been missing all these years!This grill is so easy to use. I didn't get the chimney starter, I just place some newspapers under the charcoal and it works just fine. I am usually grilling in about 15 - 20 minutes. The ash collector is fantastic, the ashes don't blow around and it makes it easy to remove the leftover ashes. I got blue, it really looks great. The little hook inside the lid makes it easy to set it aside so you have both hands.This is going to be a great summer - now if we could just get some sun here in the NW!
B00004RALQ Order this blue grill a week ago and got a defect with 2 big black dent on the side on the cover exposing the inside metal. I was a little disappointed. Try to contact Amazon customer service on the web and was amazed that they have a \"please call me\" service. I just typed in my phone number and they call me right away. The return for a replacement is painless and they order a new one for me right away. All I need to do is put the damaged grill in the original box, re-tape it, leave it outside my front door. UPS was here the next day, pick up the box and return to Amazon. That was really easy.I finally receive my new blue grill today. It is perfect and only took me 10 minutes to assemble it. The ash tray needs a little adjustment with a plier and now it is working perfectly. I have ordered a work table and putting it in is a snap.  I also got the smokenator and it fit perfectly inside the grill. Try the cover and it fit perfectly and no gap in between with everything in place. I am a happy camper and ready to do some bbq this weekend.  The blue color looks really nice in my backyard for an extra $10.So do not get despair if you get a defect, just keep returning and you will eventually get a perfect one. It worth the wait.I am glad that I only need to return it one time. On my reasons of return, I mention this grill is defective and should not put back on the shelve and send to other customers. I also contact Weber and let them know about this so they can improve their product quality control in the future before boxing their products and send to the distributor.Hope this help and good luck.
B00004RALQ We ordered this for the FIRST time on February 5, 2010.  My husband was so excited and rushed out to buy charcoal, cleaning brushes, etc.  When we got it and he opened the box we discovered one of the handles was bent, and there was a large section that had no protective paint over it, making us fear it would rust prematurely.  Needless to say we were disappointed.  He boxed it up and I called Amazon, and they were great!  They immediately sent us a return packaging slip, and placed a new order (at upgraded two day shipping no less) for us.  So, once we got all that straightened out and got the second one (which looked great by the way) we unpacked it and looked forward to making the chicken we had prepared.My husband put it together and brought it over to me and I must say, the blue looks a heck of a lot cooler than the basic black!  This is the upgraded model with the reservoir for ashes, and while I don't do a lot of grilling, my husband really appreciated this aspect of the grill.It was easy to put together, and Weber has a wonderful reputation when it comes to grill products.  The chicken we cooked on it came out wonderfully, though we have had a gas grill for the past few years, so the extra time a charcoal grill takes will take some time to get used to.All in all well worth the money.//Update March 2013: Wow. Has it already been over 3 years? I guess it has. This grill is still going strong. We clean it regularly, and keep it covered with one of the standard Weber grill covers. It has no rust and still cooks some great food. The ash catch is an absolute must have with the charcoal grills. Still very pleased with this purchase. Especially seeing as we've had other grills fall apart in little over a year.
B00004RALR I love BBQ. For convenience I have often used a gas grill, but really do love the taste of meat cooked over charcoal (PAH and NCA risks notwithstanding). I have often cooked turkey breasts for Thanksgiving, and particularly love the smokey flavor that comes with it! Alongside baked potatoes and fresh veggies (extra nice on the grill), I have a special meal that is actually healthy.So when my last gas grill bit the dust, we went back to the old fashioned way of cooking! Real charcoal, real delicious smell, real delicious flavor! I suggest that you consider using theWeber 7416 Rapidfire Chimney Starter, so that you can have the purest taste without any chemical oders.A funny thing happened when a dear friend came by to visit ... Her son was entranced by the fact that we didn't have any fuel for our BBQ.  Times change, but old fashioned flavor doesn't. This grill made  the move with us recently and now sits on our new deck waiting for spring, or at least a nice sunny day!
B00004RALR Great Product! Makes it fun and easy to Bar-B-Que.I have a Weber Gas Grill and use it all the time. However when I want that real charcoal flavor nothing beats this Weber Grill. The ashes just fall into the bottom for easy removal.A great product and reasonably priced.
B00004RALR the grill is fine, but what i was really hoping was the clean up of the ashes was actually \"one touch\".  perhaps you can get used to it, but removing and re-attaching the ash-catcher is a bit of a pain.  there are much better ways to design an ash catcher that would be easy to remove and re-attach. oh well...hopefully weber will spend some money on a re-design for the ash catcher in future models.
B00004RALR This is my second Weber...the first lasting me about 7 years. We like charcoal (instead of gas) and the Weber is a wonderful all-around grill.
B00004RALR When it came time for us to get a new charcoal grill I searched every site and checked out dozens of different grills, some costing many hundreds of dollars, all promising some advantage.Some units were really interesting, and not too expensive, but upon close inspection many of these proved to be tinny and cheaply made. The very expensive systems were very nice, but did not offer rotisseries and other useful accessories and were just too expensive for us anyway.So, we ended up with another Weber, the Gold Model. In the many years since our last Weber, there have been a lot of improvements that kept it attractive. The ash catcher really does make cleanup much easier and the vent system is more functional. The grill itself has the new flip-up hatches that allow you to add more coals and move them around without having to lift up the grill. I did that all the time with the old grill.The optional little bent-wire style of charcoal retainers do help to keep the coals out to the side when you want to use a drip pan in the center.Others have recommended the chimney style charcoal start for ecological reasons. It is also just plain faster to use as well, and it is made of heavy gauge metal that is both attractive and long-lasting.I love the optional rotisserie (see those reviews) and it comes with an extension ring that is also useful for other cooking options.We got the green colored kettle and it looks very nice on the patio. The general design and those odd white-wall tires give it a kind of vintage look.This is a well-made and very functional grill with all sorts of interesting available accessories that really work well. There is a reason for the popularity of the Weber. I looked, I bought. Hard to beat................Update 7/2012. Still good, used daily all summer and even in the rain under my porch cover. Something I came up with that could be interesting to the more dedicated user. I essentially bought a downed oak tree and have been splitting it for firewood for next winter. Had a lot of small, crooked, knotty, twisted pieces that couldn't easily be split. I cut them up into 1\" cubes on a band saw, hoping to use them as briquettes in the Weber. A newspaper sprinkled with cooking oil got them started in the Weber chimney starter quite quickly. The secret is to be a bit patient so that they stop flaming and turn to glowing coals. And then you have a genuine oak BBQ, just like on a ranch. Very good, but a lot of work and dangerous enough even on a band saw. And it messes up the blade and rollers. The other more accessible method would be to simply start an oak campfire in the Weber, using regular old pieces of oak like you would in a fireplace. It would take some time to burn down to coals, but even more of an excuse to drink too much and then burn the food because....well, everyone has done this. Right? Anyway, flaming oak imparts a kind of bitter taste while glowing oak coals make it delicious. I do this research for you.__________________________Update 2, on cooking an expensive steak. This works and requires no skill. I went out and bought the most expensive steak ever, an organic, grass fed, free range whatever ribeye at a boutique market and the attractive butcher girl probably had her thumb on the digital scale besides. I about died when I saw the price. Hmmm, can't afford to cook this any way but perfectly.I once saw a YouTube video on how to properly cook a steak using high heat and this is my BBQ grill interpretation of that.Use the coal retainers to block off a section of the lower grill and fill up that smaller portion with lots of hot coals. It cannot be too hot in this case.Put on the cooking grill and let the previous session's grease flame off, which of course also heats it up hotly and is somewhat entertaining and makes you feel guilty about what you are eating...Put on the steak. Having those long tongs helps a lot. You can rub it with olive oil if you want, but it is unclear to me if that is necessary and it causes more flame-ups. No BBQ sauce though. Lid off! Deal with the flame-ups by maneuvering the steak around. Some people use a water spray. This is hands-on, attentive work.Stand by. It will cook fast. Have your other food well under way. Within minutes the down side will have that crust of goodness, short of burnt of course. Turn it over and do the other side. When that side is seared, remove the steak and insert a digital cooking thermometer, taking care to place it in the very center, from the side (not stabbed in from the top).  I use a Polder and the line from the sensor to the display seems to hold up in high heat, but don't string it out over the coals. Run it out the back. Set the alarm for 130.Put the steak back over the un-coaled area. The effect now is that this is a very hot oven, not a grill. Put on the lid, make sure all vents are open. Watch the temp rise, amazingly fast so don't wander off.Remove the steak, with tongs, to a plate and cover it with aluminum foil, resting it as they say on cooking shows. By the time everything else is served up, maybe 10 minutes or so, it should be ready to serve.This gives you a steak that looks exactly like the ones in advertisements, medium rare with a great crust.  You can throw it back on and in a couple of minutes the temp and doneness will go up. There is no shame in putting food back on the fire, but there is shame in over-cooking it! If you paid the big bucks for your meat, burning it will make you cry.BTW, this works for other meat like thick cut pork chops (thick ones are easier to cook properly). Use the same method, but run the temp up to 140-145 (145 being the new govt standard, and in fact it is the standard for all meat other than poultry. If you were brought up on thin, over-cooked pork chops (we all were) you have a revelation coming. Chicken parts don't require the high heat, but a quick sear and off the the oven part works very well for them.It is suggested that the steak be served with salt and pepper, applied after it is cooked as it may be a bad idea to subject the salt and pepper to high heat. The more expensive the meat, the less you should put on it. Cooks always suggest kosher salt and it is indeed very good for this, and ground pepper is better as well. I really think BBQ sauce is too much for expensive beef, but if you want to fancy it up, slowly heat up some butter and garlic and let it meld together. Strain it and serve it on the side, or simply pour it on. What the heck, you have already gone well over the fat grams or whatever for the month anyway...If you have to cook more than maybe 3 or 4 large steaks, you could fill the entire bowl with coals and then finalize them in the kitchen oven set very high, like 450, and with the temp probe stuck in the most representative steak. This gives you 90% of the grilling experience and taste.
B00004RALR I have used a number of different charcoal grills, and the Weber Gold is the best.  Unless you want to spend twice the price and buy the Weber Performer, which is a Weber Gold with gas ignition, table, and a place to store charcoal. Not sure why you would want to store charcoal outside where it can absorb moisture, but that is another story.First off the Weber is made with a thicker steel, so it retains the heat better than the cheaper, lighter, offshore made products.  The grill is heavier, so you can get more than one season out of it.  The ash catcher is great.  Its a must have feature.  Other units get ashes all over my deck, which is unacceptable, and a fire hazard on windy days.My Weber Gold is about 10 years old.  I replaced the cooking grate once.  It still functions perfectly.  It lives outside and only has one tiny spot of rust, where the cover got hit with a rock and it chipped the paint.  One day I will get around to sanding and painting that spot so it lasts another 10 years.  The aluminum portions of the grill are a little weathered, but still function perfectly.  I guess if I really wanted to I could polish them up, but a little oxidation does not bother me.The only downside I can even think about is the top handle.  It is plastic, not wood.  Sometimes it gets too hot to handle so I have to use a potholder if I am cooking at a very high temperature.  Other than that, it is the best charcoal grill on the planet.Sure you can buy one cheaper, but they will not last.  Buy a Weber and you will leave it to your children when you die.  And they will get many years of use out of it too!
B00004RALR This grill works great. I love the one touch ash disposal feature. Have purchased the Rotisserie attachment also, and I LOVE what these two peices of equipment do to my Roasting Chicken!!  It will Rotisserie a small Turkey also, leaving it so jucy and tender. Will be using this for many years to come.
B00004RALR I had alwayws wanted to get a barbeque grill ever since we bought our home last year. I had been debating between 751001 and 741001 for quite some time, finally decided to go with this one for its ash catcher and it turned out to be a wise decision. Installation of the grill was fairly easy even for me. We had three families of visitors when we tried it the 1st time, we cooked a lot of meat, pepper, corn and etc, it was awesome. We have used it three times already within the 1st 10 days after we received it, it's gonna get a lot more use this summer.
B00004RALR You can grill/ bbq/ smoke just about anything shy of a half a large animal on this. Im glad I went with the 22.5. Will move up to the 26 later when needed. There are so many things you can do with this when adding other attachments (smokenator, rotisserie, pizza oven, iron grates, wok, skillet, the list goes on).
B00004RALR This BBQ grill lives up to everything written about it and the quality is quite good. The new feature of detachable ash catcher is definitely worth having. This grill cooks burgers and steaks to perfection, once you get accustomed to how to arrange the live coals (using more or less heat, etc). I would recommend this grill for anyone wanting an excellent charcoal grill.
B00004RALR Setup was easy on this grill after I realized that I will have to scrape the tabs of the ash catcher ring down the small leg posts. At first I did not like the idea of scraping my nice new grill, which is why I temporarily stumbled on the instructions. They pop in nicely once you get past this. The 3rd leg kind of twirls on which is quite obvious once you start fiddling with it but the instructions have no words so the pictures are not as self-explaintory as I would have hoped in these 2 areas.My only complaints on this grill are the legs and the handle. The legs were wobbly and not as secure as I would have liked them and they were installed all the way to the base of the grill (as the picture showed)  some nuts and bolts would have went far in this area.The handle gets to hot to handle with bare hands. especially when doing large meats like roasts or whole chickens. Wood would have fixed this problem. I wrapped mine with some small rope (not string) and it helped a little.All said and done it's a great grill. Get it.FYI-The Weber 87886 Chimney Starter is incredible and it's only 12 bucks. Get that too.Weber 87886 Chimney Starter
B00004RALR This grill is wonderful!  It cooks really evenly and the lid can hang on the side of the grill while tending to the food.  The hinged grate is great for adding wood chips for flavor.  The ash catcher makes for easy cleaning of the ashes and is worth the few extra bucks.  Our grill arrived in perfect shape and was very easy to assemble.  We use it almost every night.  This grill is sturdy and heats evenly and has the Weber name behind it.  We expect to be using it for many years.
B00004RALR Easy to assemble, though I will admit that one of the wheels keeps popping off the side when i roll it around my patio.  But then again, i rarely have to move the grill so it's not like it's a big deal.  The grill is large and easy to clean and the thing that stands out most with this grill is the ash-catching compartment on the bottom.  Plus my steaks taste way better using this thing compared to my previous grill which used propane
B00004RALR I purchased this grill, but I was surprised at how much I enjoyed cooking on it.  With the chimney starter, it is almost as fast to get this grill ready to cook as it is to get a gas grill ready - and you should let your meat set out for about 20 minutes before you grill, so you really haven't lost that much time.The ash catcher is a great feature and don't forget to get the rotisserie attachment.  You haven't had turkey for thanksgiving until you've had a rotisserie turkey!Real Men cook with charcoal and wood and this is the best grill I've ever owned.
B00004RALR I bought this for the simplicity of clean up.  I wish the kettle had an adjustable coal grate to lower or make higher the direct heat.  It takes a while to get it just right with the right amount coal.  
B00004RALR This is the best charcoal grill I have ever owned. I have cooked ribs at 225-250 and been able to control the fire easily. I used the 2-2-1 method on a rack of baby backs and never had to think about adding charcoal over 5 hours. By using the vents you can get wood chips to smolder for an hour and not flare up and burn away in minutes.  The ash pan holds at least three cooks worth of ashes and does not leak.  I feel comfortable cooking on my wooden deck because of the ash pan. The only addition i would make is the Craycort cast iron grate.
B00004RALR This grill performed as advertized in the reviews here.  Assembly is easy and takes less than a half hour.  The cooking time is longer than other charcoal grills, but is more uniform because of the ceramic cauldron reflective characteristics.  I also bought the stainless steel tools and the tool holder.  The latter ships separately from another company and the shipping/handling is about twice as much as the tool holder.
B00004RALR ridiculous pricing on these new Webers... where once you could get a 22\" model for less than $70, the company now charges (and never discounts) upwards of $100 or morehave to agree with other reviewers about:bad quality control -  issues with the the charcoal grate not fitting the four-point resting tongues - sloppily sizedpoor material choices - older models had really nice hardwood handles, but the newer models have the molded plastic crapola handles...loose 
B00004RALU That title was sarcasm, in case you missed it.When we bought a house almost fourteen years ago, I brought along a Weber Smokey Joe grill I had used when I was single.  We used it for the first several months of our marriage as our only grill.  Then we bought a Weber 22 1/2 inch kettle grill for our new backyard.  We have used it regularly ever since.  It works for indirect cooking of roasts and chickens, it works for direct grilling burgers, chops and sausages, it works for roasting chiles and it works as a fire pit to burn hardwood logs to fuel my large offset firebox smoker.  This grill has been out in the weather without a cover for 13 years or so and it has held up beyond reasonable expectations.  Only within the past few months has the use, age and abuse begun to take a toll.  There are several spots where the porcelain has worn away that are rusting through or already have rusted through.  The wooden handles dry rotted away.  The nuts holding the aluminum airflow disc adjusters at the bottom of the kettle rusted off.  And I'm still using it.  I did a steak and some pork chops last night, using lump charcoal and pecan hardwood chunks I chopped up myself.  They were delicious.I also have a gas grill that is convenient but does not even come close to giving the good taste you can get from charcoal and wood fuel.  Trying to use a smoker box on a gas grill is futile for me.  You can't adjust the airflow through a gas grill.  The only adjustment is the level of the flame.  I constantly find the wood chips either just burn up quickly without producing much smoke or they never heat up enough to start smoking at all.  The gas grill doesn't get much use at my house.I also use an offset firebox smoker.  It's great for doing large size pieces of meat or poultry or multiple pieces of smaller items.  It does require frequent attention to keep the fire going and the temperature within the proper range.  Honestly, the Weber grills can do the same or better job for smaller cuts of meat by cooking indirect.  About the only time I use the smoker is when I have something too large for the Weber.It's time retire the old Weber.  I've already put a One-Touch Gold on my Amazon wishlist.  I think I'll use the old grill as a planter.  I can't imagine throwing it away after all these years.
B00004RALU We had a gas grill for years but opted to go back to a charcoal grill.  This Weber grill made our decision easy.  Outstanding medium size grill for the two of us grilling several items and works well for 4 or more depending on what you need to prepare on the grill.  Suggest using the Weber Rapidfire Chiminey for starting your briquets...it's great and makes your job not only easier but the food taste better without the use of starter fluid.  Great grill....great name behind it!!
B00004RALU After our gas grill had to be retired, we decided to get a charcoal grill.  Weber has a reputation for having a solid product that will last for many years, and I have no doubt that we'll be using this for a long time.  But the legs seem to be made out of somewhat cheaper material than what we had when I was younger. Think I'll be getting the cover to protect it over the winter.This particular model doesn't have the one-touch ash catcher and after using this a few times, I'm kind of sorry we didn't go with that particular model.One person can put it together without help, athough it can be a struggle for a bit.Grilling?  Well that's exactly like you'd expect although I miss having a grated shelf to keep some items a little further from the charcoal.  That just requires a difference in how you mound the briskets.
B00004RALU Great grill that cooks just like a Weber!  Whoever changed the handles from wood to nylon should be fired though... they have obviously never grilled before.  This handle gets HOT!!!  Who wants to put a glove on just to open a grill... this isn't the smartest move unless Weber is attempting to save trees (but they should remember where charcoal comes from).  I won't buy another Weber if it has these cheap handles.
B00004RALU I wish I'd bought one of these the day I first moved out on my own! For years I got by with a ridiculously tiny hibachi -- one day I found myself living in the suburbs and somehow rationalized BUYING A REAL BARBECUE! Due to my dyed-in-the-wool cheapness and extensive researching before buying, it was inevitable that I'd end up with a Weber 22.5\" Silver Kettle Grill!YES the little tray on the bottom end is a pain in the neck. But I can't say it's really ever bothered me ALL that much! You'll want to use a charcoal chimney to light your coals -- I used to build a little fire with newspaper and sticks but the charcoal chimney is the way to go, and one chimney will nicely fill the coal area on the Silver Kettle Grill. Do not ever use lighter fluid or fuel-soaked coals. But you already know that.While you'll get the hang of burgers, hot dogs, steaks, chicken and bratwurst right away, make sure to investigate \"indirect grilling\" where you pile your coals on one side or the other (or both) and put an aluminum tray under whatever you're grilling. Like a pork roast or a whole chicken. The 22.5\" Silver Kettle Grill has AMPLE room for everything you'd like to do. Including grilling a turkey! Easy to do plus incredible flavor!I recently acquired a \"slide-aside\" cradle for the lid which I like a lot,  and a clip-on tool holder, which is really handy. We use the grill several times a week. I've never found it lacking. There are a few techniques you'll pick up to turn out just what you like, such as brining chicken or pork prior to cooking. You really do not have to spend more than this to get an excellent tool which you'll use for years and years to come. Get this larger size, but don't spend more on non-essentials. It's a zen thing. In place of a statue of Buddha, we suburbanites have Weber Kettle Grills in our backyard. Grilling harkens back to caveman days, satisfying something very deep in every red-blooded American -- meat good. fire good. Weber good.Order the hinged lid grate for this size grill -- it's a neat thing to have when you need it. And make sure to try grilled pizza dough -- it doesn't ooze through the grate like you'd think it would and the flavor is incredible.The perfect shape of the Weber Kettle Grill makes operation just about foolproof. Improvise an improved ash catcher underneath (like a big metal bucket!) and you're in business. GREAT product! This is not a frivolous purchase, you NEED one of these!
B00004RALU So, I thought after fiddling with offset grills and barrel grills, it's time to try a kettle grill after all the hoopla from the UPS driver delivering all my other toys.  Well folks, it's worth it.  I had to get a covered grill that wasn't as big as my car for the front porch, after all the hollering by neighbors who saw the smoke billowing from my hibachi.  After all the charcoal experimenting with my barrel grill and its cousins and a Bodum  Fyrkat, I figured, what's new?  Well, a whole lot.  While related to the Bodum, the Weber is a whole lot more versatile, and can, if you wish create a range of flavors and textures.  While the one-touch system was touted as a handy cleaning device, where it really excells is as a controllable oxygen source.  Couple that nicety with movement of the 4-hole vent in the lid and  you control both the intensity of the heated charcoals with directionality.  When you're using indirect heat, the control of the temps lay with the oxygen adjustment, whilst the direction of the heat can determine the moistness as well as the degree of charring of the food.  The heavy steel as well as the brilliantly designed cooking grate that facilitates access to the coals make for a fun time at the cookery.  The Weber is iconic; it deserves that status.
B00004RALU My original Weber is 15 years old and still going strong. Replaced some of the inner parts due to age/exposure. No need for a protective cover, this grill is built to last.  Got this one for a lake house. No need to change from the strong horse.
B00004RALU There are a lot of reviews on this already.  It is definatley a 5 star review.  I have had quite a few different weber products over the years, and this is just one more.  I love the one touch clean out on the bottom of the grill, that is also the vent cover.  The old kettles had a bottom vent that was just like the vent on top.  That little tab would get warmer than you want to touch with your bare fingers.  The new one has a handle that doesn't get too hot to handle.  The vents open easily, and move around the ashes in the bottom, and push them out the vent holes.Just one little piece of advice.  When you are installing the legs, pay attention to which leg goes where.  The one that is different goes in the hole right under the handle.  I hasve both seen and owned grills that have the wrong leg in the wrong hole, and that makes the handle on the side, intstead of the front. It is an easy fix, but easier to pay attention the first time.
B00004RALU I love this Weber One Touch Silver kettle. Seeing the kettles my relatives have, but made years earlier, i am pleased that years later, it still seems to be made with high quality steel, a good enamel and tight engineering. The handles have gone from wood to a resin, but they work well. Grilling or smoking, this unit has proven itself worth the money.I wrestled between buying the Silver or the Gold model, but what swayed me was that on Weber's site, the Silver shows \"Made in USA\" while the Gold does not. The reviewers for the Gold, here on Amazon, state that the box says \"Assembled in USA\", or something like that. The Weber site has no mention of any of it. I decided to avoid the issues that some with the Gold were reporting and I went with the Silver. It is very solid and I am glad I did.
B00004RALU This grill has one major flaw.....surprised it is still being sold due to product liability. The utterly inadequate ash/ember pan allows a mild breeze to blow the ash and embers out onto flamable surfaces...like your deck, your pine straw, or house. For an extra 50 bucks you can get an upgraded model that has an enclosed ash/ember containment system. If you live in areas prone to dryness or wildfires, you could be taking a big chance with this unsafe grill. I love the way a Weber cooks, but this model is needlessly risky.  And if you have one of these grills,  take precautions like putting a metal bucket under this grill. A paint can works nicely and you can buy clean empty paint cans at Lowes. This will help reduce the fire risk and will keep ash from blowing around wildly.....it also makes getting rid of ash an easy task. If you value the property you live in, or think you owe your neighbors some due diligence, avoid this flame thrower.
B00004RALU I had a Weber Kettle grill 20 years ago.  I had no clue what I was doing, but I still got great results.  Open the vents, put on the dome, and a little while later I had great food.  But I got tired of waiting for charcoal to heat up, and went on to propane.  I never got good results with gas.  After wasting way too many years destroying food on gas grills, I came home to charcoal and Weber.  This time around I know what I'm doing, and the Weber is giving me Fantastic results.  The 22 1/2 kettle is a great all around cooker.  It grills, sears, bakes and does a very good job of \"low and slow\" smoking.  If you only have the room or desire for one cooker, get this one without hesitation.  It won't smoke quite as good as a real smoker, but unless you're a perfectionist, you'll never know the differance.  The 18 inch grill is a great cooker too, but because it's smaller it's harder to smoke on it.  So if you have the room, get this model.  The lid and bowls are built like a tank.  I found the unit wiggles around where the legs attach, even though I assembled it correctly.  The older ones don't wiggle.  But that's progress.  I don't think it's a problem though, just an observation.  I was torn between 4-5 stars because of that.  They have been building these forever, so assesories and replacement parts can be had easily.Built solid, mutliple uses, food tastes great, easy to use.  Not much else to say.
B00004RALU Alright,I am one that loves to grill, but doesn't know anything about grills themselves, really. Due to monetary situations I had to grill on the cheapest possible grill... The green Sunbeam camper grill. I'm sure you know what grill I'm talkin' about. For over 6 years it has been my grill of choice (hey it was only $10!) and has treated me well. Over these years I always dreamed about owning a \"real\" charcoal grill. I wanted the American icon, I wanted the Weber One-Touch. I heard all about how durable and well built it was, how it will last for 10 years+ and how it's just a step above the rest. After actually purchasing this grill I have a bit of buyers remorse. You see, before actually buying this I was looking at a grill from Char-Broil. It had the ash catching pan like the One-Touch gold, it had space to put plates and such (sorta like the One-Touch Platinum) and it had grates with adjustable height, not to mention all of this came at a price just $5 higher then the One-Touch Silver! Anyways, for the last 2 years I wanted nothing more then the Weber so I got it. Once I started puting it together I realized that this grill just doesn't seem to have $80 worth of craftsmanship. The legs are super-flimsy hollow aluminum pipes, very cheap. The itsy bitsy tabs that hold the bottom grate are slightly uneven so my bottom grate is a bit wobbly (also it's possible for the bottom grate to fall because the tabs are pretty small). A wobbly bottom grate probably doesn't make a lick of difference when it comes to grilling, it's just that it wasn't right, it's just one of those little annoying quirks. I guess I expected everything to be heavy duty. I expected solid metal legs and such. You can find an identical grill from Char-Broil for less then half the cost! I hear that Weber is a step above because they are built to last... well my cheap $10 Sunbeam is 6+ years old and I've never had any problems with it, it's all about how you take care of it. Personally, I think for the $80 price tag of the One-Touch silver, you should at least get the hinged cooking grate, but you don't.There are good things however. First, it's just nice to have the American icon. There is a certain feeling that comes with grillin' on the good ol' Weber kettle. There are a TON of accessories made for it and replacement parts are extremely easy to find. The one-touch system is pretty handy (although hardly one-touch).Overall I am still happy with the purchase, I love looking at that grill. It's probably gonna grown on me more and more as years pass by. Based on price I decided to get the Silver version, but the Gold might be worth looking at. Afterall you get a much better ash-pan (I modified my silver to be just as good though... just a little creativity should do the trick) and you get the hinged grate with the gold (although you can just buy this grate for $15-$20 and stick it on your Silver if you wanna)Choose... but choose wisely.YEAR UPDATE-----------------------------------------------------Okay, now it's been over a year since I posted my original review. This really is a great grill, I wish I could bump the stars up to 4, but I can't... Amazon wont let me. Some of the minor quams I said previously still apply, but this baby cooks a mean dish! I have abused mine for a year and it runs like brand new.What really made me do this update was when I grilled on a buddy's kettle. It wasn't a weber kettle and it shows. After a year of using this I got to know this grill really well, I got used to such high quality materials. This grill really is above and beyond most other kettle style grills.I do wish I would have purchased the gold though. The ash pan that comes with the silver is not much use if you're grilling in any sort of wind.
B00004RALU I love this grill. This is one of my four weber kettle grills I own.Assembly is a snap. The only tool you'll need is a hammer to tap the wheel lugs on. In 15 minutes you can be lighting your coal.The beauty of this grill is the kettle design which maximizes heat retention and allows the grill to act like an oven with the top on. I've cooked whole chickens, cabbage, bread, and pizza using this method. The top also has a hook on it so you can hang it from the side of the grill while you add sauce or tend to what you're cooking.For best results at indirect cooking, use the hinged 22 1/2 inch grate.  That way you can add coals throughout the cooking process without the danger of having to totally remove the cooking grate.
B00004RALU First the good. I love the looks of this grill. It is sleek, styling and iconic and I enjoy seeing it on my porch.- It is much more attractive than one of those monstrous gas grills.- It seals very tightly.- Its simple style allows you to cook many different meats in many different ways.- There are so many accessories available for it and they are easy to find.Now the bad. Besides the black metal kettle part, everything else seems to be of terribly cheap quality and not what I would expect in this price range.- The legs and bottom frame are made of shockingly thin and weak metal. I wouldn't buy my kids toys with such cheap trashy metal.- The wheels are made of cheap hard hollow one-sided plastic. Again, I would not buy a children's toy with such cheap wheels.- The side handle melted during the first use when we hung the lid from it while cooking.Let's face it. This is a lot of money for a basic charcoal grill. You are paying for quality and looks. I gave it four stars only on the merit that there simply isn't a viable competitor right now. If there were other options it would not have fared so well. I feel like Weber has taken advantage of their good name and market share and is allowing their quality to suffer.Shockingly, I would buy it again.
B00004RALW Bought this small Weber for use by my wife and me since our kids are all grown up nowadays.Easy to assemble, Weber quality as expected. We also bought the cover and are pleased with both.Cooking surface is not large; but, can easily accommodate three steaks and a couple of veggie skewers.
B00004RALW I've had the 18.5 Weber kettle for about 5 years and have been very happy with it. However, anyone shopping for a grill should consider the full-size, 22.5 grill.We bought the 18.5 because our family is small and I figured this would be plenty big enough. What I didn't consider was that a larger grill will give you lots of additional options for indirect cooking and smoking. The 18.5 just doesn't have the space, even for a small family. If you only want to cook burgers and hot dogs for 3 to 4 people, the 18.5 will serve fine but you won't have much versatility.Now that I've \"grown\" as a griller, I wish I had the One-touch Platinum. This model gives extra space, an ash catcher, temp gauge, sliding lid and 2 side tables. However, my 18.5 is still going strong after 5 years of steady use and sitting in the elements. Kinda difficult to justify the new grill when the old one is still in great shape.
B00004RALW Can't beat Weber Grill's for sturdy build and ease of use. Perfect for small get togethers or smaller households. Would recommend easy start charcoal or get a charcoal starter that weber sells and pour the coals in when ready. Charcoal grate is of a very heavy guage and should last for years as well as the cooking grill its self. Some nice accessories to go with this unit:, IE: Heavy Duty Grill cover, Tool Rack, Cutting Board, Bracket for holding lid to name a few. I really enjoy steaks and burgers on this weber! One of the best grills I've ever owned for a evenly grilled and tender sirloin steak! Learning how to use upper and lower vents makes all the difference! Using the direct and indirect methods I grilled/smoked a sirloin tip roast that came out superb with a nice even bark and the mouth watering taste of hickory smoke and a light coating of bbq sauce! Going for ribs next...After reading many reviews on Weber grills, some complain of the ashes clogging the lower vents....duh...clean the thing out after each use! Thats what the ash pan is for...no brainer!!!!
B00004RALW I got this in addition to my Weber Genesis Platinum Grill. I love my Charcoal grill especially for those times when I want Steak, Burgers, Chicken, BBQ Chicken, for a great authentic taste. It heats quickly (Weber Chimney) about 20 minutes. It is easy to assemble, very sturdy and quite stable. Some reviewers noted they could not move with hot coals and food as it only has one handle. You should never move a hot grill of any kind. It should be used in a safe place away from combustable materials. The Weber Silver Kettle Grill is terrific and I use it almost regularly and in combination with my gas grill for a complete cooking experience outdoors. (I also have a smoker for the real low and slow cooking). The 18 1/2 inch cooking surface is excellent, and 2 zone and 3 zone is possible by adjusting the number of coals used and position. I did 2 zone cooking and all worked extremely well.
B00004RALW I love this grill.  This is one of my four weber kettle grills I own.Assembly is a snap.  The only tool you'll need is a hammer to tap the wheel lugs on.

I've cooked whole chickens, cabbage, bread, and pizza using this method.  The top also has a hook on it so you can hang it from the side of the grill while you add sauce or tend to what you're cooking.My only complaint about this is its size.  Its great for direct cooking steaks, chops, etc.  But to do some more long term smoking of ribs, whole chickens, its a little small because the coals get too close to the sides of the food and some parts might get scorched.  If you do a lot of slow, indirect cooked foods, go for the 22 1/2 inch weber kettle grill.
B00004RALW After owning a couple of those flimsy &#34;bargain&#34; grills, I finally got serious and bought a Weber!  This 18-1/2-inc size is perfect for a few hamburgers or steaks.  The construction is first-rate, and there is no wobbling or flexing when it is moved about.  I suggest making your purchase complete by getting a Weber charcoal starter chimney (go ahead and get the larger size).
B00004RAMT What's in the box?Just the trapWarning:  you need to check with local laws and ordinances with respect to trapping specific animals.  My locale allows year round trapping and disposal.  Bear in mind, some areas do not allow transfer of animals from one location to another to limit spread of disease.SetupDepending upon what you're trying to catch, you place the appropriate bait distal to the lever in the compartment of trap.  I am catching raccoons, and they enjoy, fish, crispy bacon, nuts and marshmallows.  The trap is a little tricky to set up.  Lift the metal gate and secure a small latch that connects to a slot in the door.I have a recommendation with regards to placement.  Because the floor is open, I recommend placing this on a piece of cement or plywood.  It will keep you from having to dig out a lot of dirt, which I have done.The trap is durable and will keep your critter secure.ConclusionI caught my first raccoon on the first night.  Worked like a charm.Highly recommend.
B00004RAMT easy to set up but they got the apple and didn't stick around to say thanks for the snack.  maybe next time
B00004RAMT I caught over 18 rabbits, 1 squirrel and 1 feral cat with this trap within the first month of its use. The trap is well constructed and holds up to heavy abuse by the trapped animals. The only reason I gave it 4/5 is that it takes two hands to open the trap. If I ever catch a skunk I am going to be in for a stinky experience. It would be nice if this trap had a quick release mechanism that could be operated from a little distance and a long pole of some sort.
B00004RAMT I caught five raccoons in six days of having the trap set. Sometimes the raccoon turns the trap over after he is trapped but it doesn't open. The carrying handle and shield came off with the second raccoon. I used a needle-nose pliers to wrap the shield flange around the wires of the trap and now it stays on securely. I also used the pliers to tighten the wires that hold the carrying handle on. Subsonic .22 caliber bullets can humanely eliminate the raccoon without a lot of noise. Marshmallows make good bait. Something fishy will catch raccoons but it can also catch cats and opossums, which I am not trying to reduce.
B00004RAMT I did not have to make any adjustments either to the trigger or trigger arm.  Just be sure the cage is completely level and the trigger arm nor the door is rubbing up against anything to obstruct or slow down the releasing of the trap door.However, ground squirrels are clever little critters.  Most times you come out and see the door sprung and the food gone is because they tried getting the food out the other end of the cage through the wire - and they can do that.  I cut a piece of OSB to completely cover the other end of the outside of the cage and tied it on with wire. The first time I used heavy cardboard - they ripped it to shreds to get to the food. Then all you have to do is upend the cage - drop something covered with peanut butter in (I use graham crackers)- it will stick to the wire and OSB (also slowing down the squirrel just enough to trip the pan).  Use a little stick if you have to, to mash it to the wire and OSB.  Another good bait are apple strips.  These are made with apple peelers that have the little crank.  The whole apple peel comes off in one strip.  This also slows down the squirrel and the apple peel will cover part of the pan.  Bigger items like this are more successful than small ones.It was more work taking the critters away and releasing them that catching them.This is a perfect size to catch ground squirrels - the size down is a bit small - this one has more room they have to cover to trip the pan - in other words they can't just dangle half their body in, grab the food and leave without getting near the pan.
B00004RAMT Using peanut butter and marshmallows in a papercup as bait I have trapped and transported 4 out of a family of 5 raccoon away from my Koi pond.  I take them 8 miles away and release them near a small river.  Only one left is one of the teenagers, I'll probably get them next week.  If I had hired a &#34;critter getter&#34; to trap them, they would have killed them which I didn't want.Easy to set, easy to pick up without exposing yourself to the animal inside.  I like the way it opens, I cover the trap with a towel so they can't see me and just pop the door up.  The minute they see the opening, they are gone.If you are going to transport them remember that it is against the law in some areas.  Also recommend that you put some wood underneath the cage in your car to protect your interior.  Anything they can reach they will try to use to claw their way out.
B00004RAMT I do catch, spay, release for cats.  currently I use a low priced trap that has literally fallen apart as various spot welds have failed.  this Havahart is simply better made.  only time will tell if all the pieces stay together.
B00004RAMT I had to look up the dimensions of this particular trap since the description lacks that information.  It's 32\"x10\"x12\"Works well for our needs:  Feral cat Trap, Spay, Release with the Humane Society
B00004RAMT Over the summer, I was constantly noticing piled mulch in my beds and every time I would go to flatten it back out I would find a cat poop covered up; not only a pain to clean up but also a health hazard too.  After checking the security tapes I found it was a feral cat problem we had.  I found this trap on Amazon and saw a good majority of the reviews were favorable and decided to give it a try.  Setup out of the box was a little confusing at first but the kit is mostly assembled out of the box.  The only parts you have to assemble are the pole from the step that triggers the door to a hook on the door and to secure the back of the cage closed.  It was a bit of a challenge to get the pole from the step to the door to line up but it seemed so simple after getting it together.This trap is very durable.  Solidly constructed, pre-assembly out of the box was a positive.  The first night I set up the trap with a small paper plate of a little bit of wet cat food.  I checked on the trap after a couple hours and had caught my first feral cat.  I transferred it to a different cage to take to the shelter the next day and set the trap up again.  All told over about a week I had caught nearly 8 feral cats, I couldn't believe there were that many in my neighborhood.  What is great about this trap is the assembly of the door, easy to open and release the animal should you be looking to relocate an animal such as opossum's or groundhogs.  The best thing you can do is to cover the trap with an old towel.  Not only will it help protect you from clawing animals but I found that it helped to calm the animal and also kept the trapped animal from giving away what the trap really is to other animals.For the price, this is a really durable animal trap and I have been satisfied to own it.  I've even lent it to a few friends and they have told me they had great results capturing their troublesome creatures of the night.  The best part is the unit can be easily broken down to store flat against the wall, and can pop back together quite quickly when you need it.
B00004RAMT We needed a trap to catch a skunk raiding the chicken house.  It worked as expected, although I did not enjoy having to get close to the skunk once caught. Not the fault of the trap though.
B00004RAMT Had a possum.  Put this out with some dog food and caught it in less than 3 hours.  I had an animal guy come out, couldnt catch the possum and try and charge me $500.  Way easier, cheaper and faster
B00004RAMT This works well, but be sure not to buy this for smaller rodents, such as squirrels or rats.They are too small and light to trip the mechanism that swings the door closed. I've used this trap to catch large opossums and it's the perfect size. The animal was not harmed and we were able to set it free without touching the little fella. Recommended.
B00004RAMT We've borrowed many traps over the years to catch, spay/neuter and release stray cats in our neighborhoodbefore finally buying two of this Havahart trap # 1079 which we found at Home Depot a couple years ago.After borrowing a variety of brands, one can't help but notice a big difference in quality from one brand to another.Many have thinner wire then Havahart, which is trickier to get the trigger rod set.Some may be painted (like at Tractor Supply) rather than galvanized for rust resistance like Havahart.Some have had a smaller hand guard, or worse ~ none.CONCLUSION ~ Havahart is an easy to use, excellent preforming,  quality constructed, durable trap.With heavy gage galvanized wire and all smooth/ rounded edges. It's a five star product.As if it couldn't get any better ~ Havahart is made in America.Footnote:  For convenience ~ three sizes of Havahart traps ~Small ~ Ideal for catching chipmunks, rats, squirrels and similar-size nuisance animals7.1\" long ~ 2.4\" wide ~ 3.5\" high.Medium ~ Ideal for catching rabbits, skunks, squirrels and similar-size nuisance animals. (this one)25\" long ~ 7\" wide ~ 7 1/4\" highLarge ~ Ideal for catching raccoons, stray cats, groundhogs (woodchucks), opossums, and similar-size nuisance animals.32\" long ~ 10\" wide ~ 12\" high.
B00004RAMT We bought this ~1 week ago and we've caught 2 groundhogs thus far. We used strawberries for ours. We grated some strawberry on the cage, then tossed one in the back of the cage. We set it next to their burrow, then literally waited 1-2 days each.Some suggestions: Make sure to place the cage so you can check it from afar. We didn't know we caught one for a good portion of the day. Luckily it was a cooler day, so he/she was ok. Also make sure to weight the cage a bit, bc sometimes a moving cage will spook them back out of it. Had no problems with opening the door afterwards, but make sure to open it away from you because they nearly fly out of it!
B00004RAMT This is the perfect size for catching the large raccoons and woodchucks eating inside our fenced garden.  Having only one door assures that an animal has to enter far enough into the trap for the door to close.  So far the trap has caught an animal each day.
B00004RAMT The coons steal the bait from this trap at will. I've had to re-engineer the trigger to even trip as a bowling ball rolled into it wouldn't engage the trip at first. They advise putting bait past trip plate, but the coons just reach through the mesh and get the bait, another serious design flaw. There are traps that work, this just in NOT one of those. Save your money!
B00004RAMT I had a raccoon problem, used peanut butter sandwich (small bits each night) and each night I got a coon. its easy to set, tho after you have had many wild animals in it, the latch may need to be worked on a bit. after two full years of outside use, and many many coons, I am in need of a new one. a really large raccoon bent the bottom too much to be reworked but I figure I have gotten my money for the first one in the first 2 weeks, as I was getting rid of my coon family one per night.and, no, its not the same one coming back, we simply had that many.my advice, put the bait in the far back corner and place your trap so the front opening is easy to see and get in, but the rest of the trap I had tucked in to bushes just enough to hide some of it but not get any branches in the way of the trap shutting.  check your trap right away in the morning, you dont want an animal trapped longer than he needs to be. it is unlawful to relocate wild animals, so know ahead of time what you will do with the animal once its in the trap. besides, on one wants your infestation on their property.  (a nice farm is a bad idea, farmers I know shoot raccoons and other relocated pests FYI)
B00004RAMU I put my bait (peanut butter) on the top of the entrance box so it gets between these and the lid. Attracts great and the mice can't get to it so the same bait works for months.No setting required, you don't even really need bait if well placed. I keep these under garage shelving, under stairs, in the floor of the pantry, etc. and just let them sit until successful.There is another model with a clear lid, not needed and these don't have plastic to break. An unadvertised benefit is that these have a \"built in alarm\" of the catch. The mouse (or mice) will push around on the one way ramp which make a metallic tapping sound to alert you of their presence in the trap.If you want to release live, thats great, but if you want to dispose of the mice, just take the trap and set it in the sun for a bit and the mice will expire fairly quickly.
B00004RAMU Has caught mice, but only the smaller ones. Has also caught voles, but again, only the juveniles. Perfectly humane, but rodents, even if left in a trap like this overnight, tend to eat each other.  So yes, the trap works, but in  my experience, not the solution for anything but the smallest rodents.
B00004RAMU We get a lot of mice when the weather turns cold.  I've tried every type of mouse trap on the market, including spring traps, repeating traps, electronic traps, etc.  The old-fashioned spring traps are the best and cheapest solution, but they can be a bit gruesome.  This tin cat trap is the most reliable alternative I've found.  When I hear, see, or smell mice, I put this out and invariably end up finding mice in it the next morning.  The first tin cat that I bought almost 20 years ago is still catching mice.A few important notes:- This is only a live catch mouse trap if you check it daily.  You can't expect to catch mice, leave them in the trap for a week, and expect to find live critters the next weekend.  If they die in the trap, you'll face a smelly clean up task.- I noticed a lot of reviews from people who said the trap stopped working.  In my experience, this is almost always because something has gotten wedged under the trap-door ramp.  Often it seems to be because the mice crawl into the semi-enclosed trap door spaces to die if you don't empty the trap in time.  If the trap is outdoors, twigs and bits of sand can blow up the trap-door ramps and keep them from working.  95% of the time, just banging the trap on the ground a few times dislodges whatever is in the way.  About 2-3 times a year, I spray off the inside of the trap with a garden hose, which seems to clean out remaining debris just fine.In a nutshell:  This is a great trap design that consistently catches mice and has worked for me for decades.  In my experience, the trap has proven to be very reliable and durable with an occasional bit of cleaning.
B00004RAMU We had tried 3 other traps with no results. This one finally caught out tiny friend and I was able to let him go free in a nearby field. I was happy knowing that the mouse didn't have to die just because he dared to come into my home. He was happy to be living and not with a broken neck.Its a win/ win!
B00004RAMU We purchased this mouse catcher last year when we were suddenly inundated with winter lodgers in the basement.  At first, this trap did a fine job, but then it just petered out on us and stopped working.With items like this it is hard to say where the fault lies, so we are giving it Three Stars.  We had better luck though with the Woodstream Havahart Mouse Trap.Three Stars.  Leaves mice sweaty but ready to live outside again.  For us the trap stopped trapping after a couple of months.
B00004RAMY I bought two of these at a large, orange home improvement store two days ago after reading reviews on Amazon.  Same price as here, by the way. Set them that evening, in the dark, using the technique advocated by other reviewers here... that is, gently tamped down a small section of a main, straight run until level with ground, cut grooves on either side for the trap jaws to sit in, set tap, and set trap down in grooves with the release lever sitting against the tamped-down ground.  One day passed with no action, but after a whole lot of rain yesterday evening, the mole was in the trap this morning!He was caught in the edge of the jaws, telling me I could have planted the trap a tiny bit deeper.  There is another method advocated online involving digging out a section of the mole run, building a dirt bridge across the hole, placing the trap down in the hole, and covering with dirt.  This might be an even better strategy, but either way, I'm happy with the result.  I left the traps out, just in case another mole decides to make use of his subterranean highway system. Will update if there is any more action, positive or negative.
B00004RAMY Update June 3, 2011More mole activity which has now been stopped by a Victor trap. This time the activity was in the back yard including a flower bed. I decided to skip the test pressing phase and just selected a mole run, pressed the soil down and placed the trap. Sure enough the next day I had a dead mole in the trap. I had set two traps and the second one didn't catch anything so they are both back in the garage waiting for the next mole trapping adventure.Original reviewFive hours after I set two traps I had trapped a mole; I was truly surprised to see one trap sprung and at first thought it must have accidently tripped; I pulled the trap out of the ground and there was a dead mole, the trap had done its job perfectly.I had lived at my house for over 30 years and this mole infestation was a first. When I started seeing the raised soil trails and dead grass I suspected I had somehow gotten a mole in my yard. I started reading everything I could find on the web and started getting free advice from friends.I called the pest service we use and the man suggested I buy the Victor trap as that was the one they used and the cost of them coming out and setting the traps could get very expensive. I read the Amazon reviews on the trap and they were generally helpful so I decided to buy the Victor traps.The general advice was to locate active runs by pressing down the soil that had been displaced by the mole which I did and then followed up with a hose to really flatten them down. Sure enough the following day certain trails had been raised up again and I selected one of those to place the traps.My yard has a sandy soil mixed with clay; it is also rather root infested so I followed several recommendations which said it was important to cut away any roots that might hinder the traps free movement. Before I placed the trap that caught the mole; I used a straight edged steel edger and pressed it down into the soil where the trap would be placed; sure enough I had to cut through several roots that crossed that area. I used my foot to press down the raised area where the trap would be placed.It took a little experimentation to finally get the trap set; I had never set a trap before so this was all new to me. It does take some pressure to set the trap; there is a safety latch which can be engaged first but then additional pressure with the tools provided is needed to actually set the trigger.I left the safety latch in place until the trap was set in the ground and I had pressed it down so the trigger was resting on the soil. Once that was all done I released the safety latch and the trap was ready.I covered the trap with a garden pot to keep the area dark and protect it from being disturbed by local cats and dogs. This was all done late yesterday morning and by mid afternoon it had trapped a mole.I will update this review if anything of interest happens. In the meantime both traps are in place waiting for the next mole.
B00004RAMY This type of trap is highly effective IF you do NOT follow the directions about how to place it. If you bury it (which the directions will tell you to do) it will simply NOT work. If your \"out o sight\" trap is out of sight it is TOO DEEP and all you will get is holes in your yard and perhaps an annoyed mole.When the very expensive exterminator (who we now refer to as \"Mark the Mole Man\") came to our house, I showed him our \"out of sight\" mole trap. He tried to be respectful but finally just said, \"Ma'am, that's too deep. Ain't gonna kill nothin'.\" As it turns out, this is exactly the same type of trap he uses. He just knows how to use it correctly.He pulled it up and knocked the dirt off and walked around the yard for a while telling me stuff about moles. He clearly took great pride in his mole murdering skills (please don't give PETA my address.) Finally he stopped, stood silently for a moment, then he stepped his boot gently on a run until the soil was level with the surrounding soil. Next he took his special tool for making the slits that the previous reviewer described making with a shovel, and he made his two slits in the run for the blades to fit into.Then, artist that he was, Mark the Mole Man pressed the trap blades slowly into the slits he had made until the flat trigger was sitting gently on the soil. Released the safety and - Done. He placed three more in the back yard (BIG yard) and 24 hours later we had a dead mole.It was a wonderful (and for us expensive) experience. Go get your nasty little critter with this trap, but don't follow their directions. Listen to reviewer Geoffrey Klos.
B00004RAMY I admit it - I'm very, very ambivalent about harming any creature, even one that tears up our lawn the way moles do. But after one of our kids fell and nearly broke a leg in one of the numerous mole holes in our yard we (reluctantly) decided to cut down on the mole invasion. We did not want or need another emergency trip to the doctor's office. We also have elderly parents who visit often and the thought of THEIR falling was frightening to us.Bottom line on these traps - THEY WORK. If you want a trap that quickly kills moles, these do. They also seem to keep  suffering to a minimum. I'm not even sure the moles DO suffer because I was walking to the mailbox and felt  one of these traps go off. The mole was dead by the time I pulled it out, less than a minute later.Our lawn is no longer full of dangerous mole holes. I admit...if we'd only had an occasional mole hole, I would have stayed away from traps. We are animal lovers. We have pets.But the situation was becoming dangerous. I didn't want anyone  to get hurt walking across our yard.
B00004RAMY This trap is great.  I've read the reviews and once you get the hang of setting this trap, you realize it is simply awesome.  As mentioned by others:  DO NOT FOLLOW THE BOX INSTRUCTIONS.What you need to do:1- bend the trigger down a little2- use spade shovel in the turf to make slots (2) for the jaws.3- use good sized wood chips to obstruct an active run near the surface--enough so that the trigger rests on the wood when placed.4- check trap daily...you'll be surprised how many moles use the same run.Once I figured this trap out, I've killed 6 in the very first 2 weeks!!!***WARNING:  check the laws in your city/state.  These traps may be prohibited.  One of my neighbors called the animal warden on me and he confiscated 3 of my Victor traps claiming that they are \"leghold, steel-jawed traps\".  I will be going to court soon...
B00004RAN0 They are soooo much easier and not near as scary as the old ones.  I don't have to worry about losing my fingers.  I put peanut butter way in the back on the rod instead of where they say to put it, and I catch them every time.I do catch some mice that are small enough to not be harmed, but at least I get them.  And eventually they are not so lucky.  It's so easy to bait and so easy to catch them. Even my kid can do it without harm to her.
B00004RAN0 This trap can actually catch mice, but if they aren't small, will only injure them.  It also leaves a wiggling tempting snack for other animals to eat, who then take the mouse AND trap to locations unknown. Trap is not selective and will kill or injure anything that trips it. The most selective and humane way to trap is to use a Havahart trap, then euthanize only the problem animals with ether (found as \"starting fluid\" in automotive stores). Ether is a potent anesthetic which was used on humans in early medical procedures. It's also extremely flammable so take great care.
B00004RAN0 Occasionally a mouse will not get killed and will drag the trap away. This has not been a problem as I hav always found the trap and mouse within a short distance.
B00004RAN0 Every fall/winter season a few mice find their way into our basement pantry.  I think I've tried every deterrent out there--sticky boards, poisons, quick-set and traditional traps.  Like outdoor chipmunks, these mice are clever.  Poison blocks don't seem to interest them, and they know how to side-step sticky boards.So far, I have had the best luck with these cheaply made plastic Victor traps.  I bought two types of quick-set traps--these Victor ones andSnap-E Mouse Trap by Kness(based that purchase on popular reviews).  Even though Victor's snap isn't very strong, it does indeed kill mice.  I have yet to catch anything with the Kness traps.  They have a stronger snap, but so far all I've come up with are sprung, empty traps.  The same bait is used for both traps (peanut butter).I don't care how mice are caught, as long as the job gets done.  This season, Victor Quick Set mouse traps are proven winners.  I don't think they'll last a long time, but they certainly outperform sticky boards and are easier to set than the old-fashioned method.
B00004RAN0 Yes, these are way easier to open. I have a near phobia about things that snap..especially mouse traps. I can not, physically it is impossible for me to open an old board/metal mouse trap. I know, weird, but it just freaks me out! So, I got these and was so excited! We keep our dog food in the garage and pet food draws mice. Every spring/fall we get them in the food or the garage itself. So I tried these traps. Lots of them. I go for total overkill (pun intended) when it comes to killing anything lower than my ankles! Well, these do NOT kill anything. They spent weeks with nothing in them. But the old mouse traps (my hubby sets them) had about one every few days. He just reset his and laughed at my 'old lady' traps. Sigh. I know these look great, and they are super easy to use, but they will not kill anything. I have now read the other reviews and have no idea how anyone could give these a positive review. Also, the thought of having a LIVE mouse to deal with? What a gross, awful, torturous hassle. No thanks. Hope this helps!
B00004RAN0 Having been unable to create a method of capturing marauding mice and teleporting them unharmed to another galaxy, I resorted to a humane trap, intending to drive them several miles into the county and release them to find their county mouse cousins.  Alas and alack, the mice were able to enter the humane traps, retrieve the bait (peanut butter on a bit of cracker) and exit the traps with the bait.  Perhaps they work in pairs with one holding the door open while the other goes in for the food. With a heavy heart I next purchased a pair of these traps. For many nights the mice could count on their evening meal, the bait strategically placed in various places in this trap. They walzed in, dined, and left, no doubt laughing their little tails off.  It seems a human with a master's degree in psychology is no match for the average rodent.  Then, wonder of wonders, last night the traps actually lured two hapless diners to their death. My delight was short lived upon reading reviews here that the mice do not die instantly, but might suffer for a time before expiring. What's a person to do?  My advice, if you do purchase this type trap, is to use just the smallest amount of bait (my successful last night bait was cream cheese) which I rubbed the entire length of the pressure activated metal strip. I think previously I was using too large a piece of cheese or cream cheese. I suppose I'll continue to use the traps, as I have to get this problem resolved though it's awful to think of them suffering at all.
B00004RBDU Gets fleas AND anything else that tries to scuttle past it -- with the night light and the (perhaps nice smelling?) sticky pad it is quite attractive to creepy crawlers.Two things -- 1) use disposable gloves while changing the sticky pad. Saying &#34;eeeyew!!&#34; is optional.2) Do not think that this will catch all the fleas that might happen to infest your home and pets-- Use a sensible flea reduction program in addition to this..
B00004RBDU This is a refill package only and requires you have already purchased the Victor Flea Trap. Our experience with the flea trap has been very good and we have noticed the trap catches anything that happens to stray on its surface.The refills install easily and quickly. We have had to install a new bulb in the trap but that was also easily done. We leave the trap behind a sofa in the den and have noticed a steady decrease in trapped fleas as we've used it.This is a good supplement to flea control and can be safely used with pets.
B00004RBDU I purchased these refills at the same time that I purchased the flea trap. There are no fleas in this area who are willing to step on these sticky discs. As a result, the flea trap is of no use to me. These refills are of no use to me as well  and that is why I can give only one star. They cost only $5.76 which is too small an amount to consider returning this item. I plan to offer the flea trap and the refills on the local freecycle website in case there is someone who has a flea problem and wants to try this option.
B00004RBDU This is a review of the refills, followed by the same review as the trap.  The refills are easy to use, they come with a separate protective layer for each refill and it's fairly convenient to use the protective layer to cover the old, flea infested sticky trap when replacing it with a new refill.  Happy with the refills and the way they are packaged and installed.For the trap itself:I have 2 of these for 2 different locations.  Four stars instead of five because they do trap fleas; but they won't arrest an infestation. I use them as an indicator of the severity of the problem and whether I'm getting it under control.  Fleas are hard to see and find on carpet and furniture, not so tough to find on the dogs.The traps work best at night, don't seem to do much of anything during the day.  If I think I might have a problem or know the dogs have fleas I get the traps out.  This year we were successful with Siphotrol spray on the carpet and furniture and Barklogic's Lemongrass shampoo on the dogs (separate reveiws for those).  I count the fleas in the flea traps on a daily basis so I can tell that those measures are being effective, and when the overnight catch count goes to zero that's a good indicator the fleas are gone.If you are hoping the flea trap will cure an infestation by itself, there's a good chance you'll be disappointed. It might work, but I wasn't willing to wait that long.
B00004RBDU I first started using theVictor Ultimate Flea Trapwhen I lived in California because we had a problem with sand fleas coming in our back patio screen door. We also didn't want to use any pesticides, since we had four small house pets.When we moved to Michigan, we continued using the traps because our child was born, and we felt even more strongly about avoiding pesticides. Although we did not have a flea problem, the traps have caught several types of spiders, the occasional house fly, a few random creepy crawlies, and even a hornet! Basically, they seem to trap anything attracted to the light/heat.We keep them tucked away, out of sight (ex: in a back corner of our furnace room, under furniture), and in places where the pets can't get too curious -- getting a refill stuck to your skin (or dog fur) is the absolute worse.All in all, I think we've been using these traps for nearly ten years now. The bulbs can be replaced with regular night light bulbs or the new LED bulbs.
B00004S1RW I bought this to clear out the thick tangle of thatch in my front yard from years of neglect.  I was amazed at how easily the blades slip through the soil, leaving the grass pretty much intact and pulling up all of the detritus.  If you have a pet and have ever used a Furminator, it's basically like that for the yard.  Love it.
B00004S1RW so, I was trying to save some money and avoid buying an electric or gas powered de-thatching rake/power rake.  I thought this would be a good idea, and I will say, it works as designed but it is HARD work.  Now, this being said, my lawn has a pretty thick layer of thatch because I have a mulching, push mower.  I don't bag for multiple reasons, but bottom line, I needed a way to thicken my grass up.  The only way to do this is either aerate or remove the thatch, which I chose the thatching rake.  I worked my butt off for about 2 hours and had gotten only about 20% of my yard complete, if that.  Not sure if it's supposed to do this, but the head would swivel over about 2-4 rakings, and you will have to flip it over, to get the preferred angle.  It might be meant to do it like this, but I typically don't read directions.Its ok, nothing great, nothing horrible.  I will say the quality seems good, it's got a solid wood handle, and I think it will last longer than I'll even care to use it.  I suppose, in a pinch, you could swing this thing around and do some damage to zombies.  however, I would prefer a piercing/slicing weapon for zombie battles, for obvious reasons.
B00004S1RW This has two sides. One is better for thatch removal, the other side is good for cultivating the soil a bit.I've been able to use this rake to prepare hard soil for grass seed planting.It is sturdy, well designed, and manufactured with good materials.
B00004S1RW The head is attached to the shaft securely and doe not feel like it is going anywhere.  However, the individual metal tines bend quite easily and care should be taken to ensure that they are straight, or it is going to make your thatching job harder than it needs to be.Also, thatching a large lawn by hand really sucks!
B00004S1RW This thatch rake is great for SMALL spots.  If you plan on doing an entire yard, go rent a machine.  It takes a LOT of effort to use this rake on Augustine grass in Texas.  Having said that, the rake works as intended and is high quality / durable.
B00004S1RW I tried to dethatch my yard with an ordinary rake and found it exhausting. A thatching rake like this makes the job so much easier! It's still a lot of exercise, to be sure, but you'll certainly be glad you got this. This rake is heavy duty, high quality, and perfectly suited for the job.The head on my rake was silver in color (not black like the picture), but I don't care about this discrepancy. It otherwise is the same rake.
B00004S1RW Dethatch your lawn with this rake ONLY if you really have to!! This tool is head heavy, so your arms will get really tired, unless you are in super shape. I will allot one week to do the front lawn. I am still sore from using it on 1/3 of the lawn. It will remove everything including green, which will leave your lawn looking terrible.
B00004S1RW I used this rake to thatch our front lawn this fall.  It was very labor intensive since we have a large front yard.  I think in the feature I may try an electric thatcher to save time.  I was also disappointed by the fact that I saw the same rake at my local big box store for 10 or 15 dollars cheaper.
B00004S1RW Not for the faint hearted but a great arm exercise. This thing does pull up lots of dead grasses. Had this for more than 18mths now and it is one of the better tools. But with 5000 sq ft lawn, this is not a long term solution. The metal teeth will bend inwards if you use it forcefully enough; especially when lawn is wet. Not a big deal but can be frustrating each time you try to straighten it back. I'll continue to use this tool for small areas. For whole yard maintenance, I've upgraded to an electrical detatcher.

B00004S1VJ - Many different modes of patterns to choose from- Fairly cheap feel, but it works, and for the price I can't complain.- Doesn't quite seem to get the water pressure I like especially on the more concentrated stream settings, but again for the price its a useful nozzle.- Mostly used for washing the car, and the 7 settings come in handy there.- Amazon delivered quickly
B00004S1VJ This nozzle really fits the bill with good spray patterns that work well, good water pressure and good ease of use.  Because it's plastic, I'll have to take it in for the winter lest it leak next season, but so far it doesn't leak at all.  Each of the patterns is distinct in its function and useful and something about the design allows great water pressure where you need it even if you have a well and lower press
B00004S1VJ Over the winter our nozzle somehow got lost. This nozzle is a great price. It has lots of settings to choose from and is comfortable to hold. It screws on easily. I am very happy with its performance, and am satisfied with this purchase.
B00004S1VJ have had it for over a year now with no complaints. This is easily my favorite sprayer. Liked it so much I have one for the front AND the back hoses.
B00004S1VJ I purchased this in May 2011.  One year later and I'm back on Amazon looking for a new nozzle. Only used this mainly on weekends during summer months, so to say it lasted a year is actually being generous... probably only got about 4 or 5 months out of it and even that was light use.I bought it because I liked the idea of several different spray types.  The nozzle worked well in the beginning, though it had a cheap feel to it and I knew it wouldn't last many years.  After a few uses I noticed that the trigger would stick and not turn off so I would have to pull it to get it to stop.  Then the trigger started coming loose and cracking... just kept getting worse until the trigger snapped off.I would not purchase this again and do not recommend it.
B00004S1VJ The construction and material are sturdy, no complaints about that. All the settings work great. There is just a missing option I think. There's &#34;Center&#34; which does the center holes, &#34;Shower&#34; which does the outer - but not one that does both. Need more water for the plants!
B00004S1VJ This has worked well for me with one exception.  It must be removed from the hose in the winter.  If it freezes it cracks and will spray everywhere next time you use it.
B00004S1VJ This lasted me about two years before the plastic handle broke off.  For the price, I am surprised it lasted as long as it did!  I am sure I dropped it more than enough times.  Overall, I do not regret this purchase.
B00004S1VJ Best I ever had or would need for basic yard watering and spraying off the sidewalk, etc. So much happier with it than my other sprayer, I just ordered another for the front yard.Pros:- Feels like total control in your hands- Plenty of great settings for the spray- Mist spray is wonderful- Doesn't leak (or bathe you)- This is real quality, so great priceCons:- None
B00004S1VJ Nice nozzle and cheap enough so I can have several around the house.  The pattern selection works find (stream and flat get the most use by me).
B00004S1VJ This spray nozzle is pretty sturdy... self explanatory, no need of directions, just turn the knob to whatever settings you want. All spray dials works just fine... have been using this for a little while ( no complaints ). I highly recommend, even for decent price.
B00004S1VJ this nozzle has a comfy grip and good selection of water spray patterns and is well made so i expect it to last for several years.  would recommend this nozzle
B00004S1VJ I thought the 7 patterns might be overkill,but each one is truly different.It is durable and responsive.There is not much more to say ,but is is inexpensive not cheap.Glad I bought it!
B00004S1VJ Bought it in May of 2010.  Did not use it from November to April.  That gave it a life span of 7 months before it became uusable. Spend a few dollars more for a one more sturdy.
B00004S24U I like it.  It is heavy and I use it as a base for my new impact sprinkler.  I made sure after the first use that I disconnected it and drained it, the put it over a chair to dry in the sun--don't want the rust problem if I can prevent it.  Good purchase--I had never heard of this thing before.
B00004S24U There isn't much to say about this sprinkler base. Sometimes the simplest design is the best, and in this case it is. Strong, durable and it works great. I expect to have it for years to come.
B00004S24U I leave it out, tow it around with the hose attached and forget to drain it come winter. Still working great after two years!
B00004S24U I purchased this to use with the Rain Bird sprinkler. It does the job well. One thing that I had to learn was the base holds water which has rust in it. When you disconnect this from the hose be sure that you empty the ring base and don't soak yourself with rusty water.
B00004S24U I initially purchased one for use with a rain bird plastic impact rotor sprinkler, I put an 18&#34; extension from the metal ring to the rotor. Works awesome! I have since bought three more and use one of those with another rotor, and the other two for shrub style bubblers/sprayers for my plants in the the mulch beds. One negative which isn't a huge issue for me is that if you leave water sit in it, there will be rusty water. I always disconnect the hose each time and pour out any excess water so it's not an issue, but I can see that if I didn't do that with time it could rust through or clog your sprinkler head possibly.
B00004S24U i had a couple of spike impact sprinkler, and eventually the spikes for some reason got bend. go figure. So i ordered 2 of these to replace the spikes, and they work great. the impact sprinklers fit in well. I've had them for 3 years now with no issues.  Not much more to say. Buy them with confidence.
B00004SD6U I am a working Certified Arborist, ISA.  THIS is the best tool out there for pruning, no debate possible.  I use this pruner daily.  Fiskars has the BEST customer support, as well.  Nobody else comes close.  They have sent me replacement parts for everything on this unit, as I needed them.  They have even sent me two brand new units that sit unopened in my work shed, when I simply requested new cutting heads for two units.  They sent me new heads, as well.  They have NEVER charged me one penny for replacement parts or the two, new units. I strongly recommend this tool.  Again, you cannot do better.
B00004SD6U The pruner will not release easily if you grab hold of a branch a little too thick, and at five feet away it's not always the easiest thing to do to notice if that branch is an 1/8th inch too thick.  As a result, it broke on the second day.  Amazon replaced with another, which broke due to same issue, but this time was too late to return.  I bought another, more expensive one that I am happy with and I would recommend it to anyone else: ARS LA-180ZR203 4-to-7-Feet Long Reach Pruner
B00004SD6U I had a cable driven long pruner, and besides the fact that it ... near broke my hand to clip a large branch with it, the thing was fragile.  I used to live on nearly and acre of property with a row of pines along the back.  They would get all brown near the bottom so I would try and prune them up to about the point where they could get enough sun to stay green. To do that you need a pruner with a little reach to it?I saw this model on TV and hunted it down, finding it first on Amazon.  I could barely believe the price quoted on the TV show, (it wasn't a commercial, it was a how-to show) they said the stick only cost about [$$$].  Its not quite that cheap, but the quality here is excellent.  It uses a chain, not unlike a bike chain, to drive the extended cutter. It uses a slider, leverage system to pull the chain to make the cuts.  The cutting blades themselves are very sharp and can be adjusted to any angle.  This becomes an important concern when you have about a dozen pine trees to trip.The stick will also do fine when you don't need the extended length.  Remember those hedge trimmers that looked like a huge pair of scissors?  I used to hurt my wrists every year, trying to get enough momentum to trim the bushes in front of the house I was renting.  If you tried to cut too, slow it would get stuck, too fast, and the handles would stop abruptly hurting my wrists!  This cutter, although smaller than a hedge trimmer, cut so quick and easily that it made trimming the bushes a pleasure.  I could even get lazy, and sit down in a chair, and do them from a distance. Try that with your electric model! The bushes never shaped up so well before.The blades will cut close to a one-inch branch, and I haven't had to sharpen it yet.  Just keep the chain free of dirt, and keep a little mower oil on it, or cycle spray and it continues to work like new.  Sometimes they just make a tool that becomes the defacto standard for a while, and for my money this is it.  Don't risk cutting your arm off with a chainsaw. If you've got a little pruning to do, get this Pruning Stik and start clipping away.
B00004SD6U This pruning stick works like a charm. Pull down on the handle or the end ball and voila, cuts through 1+\" branches with relative ease.Safety is the name of the game.Thorns and prickles gone.You've got 62\" distance between you and some pain. Lower levels on the ladder.This is a must have for anyone having to prune any brush of height or thorns..I have had mine for about 5yrs and it is still in excellent shape.Seems like the cutting mechanism should last a long long time.The pivoting head is very useful as well.
B00004SD6U For most yard trimming this pruner is great.  Easy to adjust, cuts limbs like butter, and is light.  I have the 12 foot model also, but for most yard trimming this one is perfect.  I have used it to trim low limbs on my Silver Maples, a variety of yard shrubs, my Magnolia trees, and woody stemmed weeds.  Anyone can use this one. Great trimmer.
B00004SD6U This pruning stick is the best thing to come along in a long time.  I had been trying to figure out how to prune our big Rhododendron bush without ruining its shape, but no matter how I tried, I just couldn't get at the  top.  This stick allows selective pruning while on a ladder or from the  ground.  It is lightweight and comfortable to handle.  Definitely well  worth the price.
B00004SD6U I have a large piece of property in Arizona that requires the removal of bushes from time to time and I figured this looked like the perfect tool to cut the main trunk/branches of a dessert bush; NOT!!!!!It was worth a try, but it is clumsy and will not cut through most of the fibrous shoots of a typical desert bush. I am back to the pick and spade.I have many tools for tree limbs that do a much better job than this.I'll give it to my brother.  :>)Note: My rating is strictly for the said application.
B00004SD6U The first one I owned my teenage son tried using it on a limb that was too big and applied too much pressure which caused it to break. As far as I am concerned it was not the companies fault that this unit was abused. I keep it now for spare parts.I am very impressed with the second one I bought. It has paid for it's self many times over and has never given me any problems when it is used properly.I am disabled with arthritis. I do not like heights. This unit is very easy to use and as it stands now I should get many more years of use from mine.
B00004SD6U I never had much of a brand loyalty for routine yard maintenance stuff until I had a problem with an old fiskars pole saw.  The hardware couldnt hold the poles anymore.  When I contacted fiskars about it (limited lifetime warranty) they sent me a part.  When the post office didnt deliver it (a common problem here) they sent me a whole new $80 saw by fed ex.  When I come across actual customer service, I buy as long as the service is good.  Fiskars earned my business and I now look for their products where available.This is a nice pruning stick.  Unlike loppers, you can stick this into a shrub or low tree and cut a branch off without needing the linear clearance to open and close the lopper.  The mechanism works very well and allows me to trim up my hedges without sticking my arms into them (we have wasps and black widows) or going through trying to use a lopper and having it hit adjacent branches.Not the only tool you need, but its a great addition.  Like most fiskars products, its very well made.
B00004SD6Y No more getting down on my hands and knees to cut grass that the mower can't reach. I use this to cut grass around my mailbox post, the street lamp post on my property, the big metal box the electric company uses to feed me from its underground cable, the post the cable company uses as my feed point and anywhere else that grass needs cutting which the mower can't handle.These shears are lightweight, are easy to use, cut the grass cleanly and, best of all, they let me stand up while using them. They do not require a battery, power cord, string or anything else besides a hand. Very handy, very useful and very good.
B00004SD6Y These shears cut just as well as standard ones, without the back strain.  Also very easy to reach under bushes, plants, etc. to do a better job of trimming.  They seem pretty sturdy as well.  Very happy with this purchase.  Only caveat--if you are tall I think the handle would be a bit short and still require some bending.
B00004SD6Y I guess this might be ok if you had one VERY SMALL area to trim but it is very tedious and time consuming to use to trim multiple areas. I tried it out but decided to return it. Instead I broke down and purchased a cordless string trimmer (18 volt) which I love and does the job much quicker and easier than this thing could ever hope to do. I wanted it to work for me but no way!
B00004SD6Y Action works well enough, but the blades only cut if you use the very tips.  I expected better from Fiskars because I have several other Fiskars hand tools.
B00004SD6Y These Fiskars 9210 Long-Handled Swivel Grass Shears will literally save wear and tear on your back and knees both when you have any small yard trimming to do. These are not made for grass trimming around the perimeter of a large yard, as your hand would wear out from squeezing the handle. We use the electric string trimmer to trim the grass against the fence around our entire yard. As for all the other trimming in the yard- around the house, the garage, around bushes, trees, sidewalks, the patio, gardens, corners and utility poles, these Fiskars Grass Shears are just perfect!These shears are meant to trim grass and lighter plants, not anything thick, but since grass is always growing around everything in our yard, they get a constant workout.  The 3 foot height is just perfect- no bending or stooping ever. There is an orange turning device on the blades, allowing you to turn these blades to any angle you need. The blades actually turn a full 360 degrees. The 5 inch blades are fully hardened for long lasting sharpness and also lock for storage or when you are turning them. We noticed they do come with a slight oil on the blades themselves.I contacted Fiskars and asked about any maintenance for the blades, and they told me they should stay sharp for years, but you could add a sharper edge to them in time with a hand sharpener- similar to a lawn mower blade sharpener. Cleaning and lightly oiling them when they become dirty will keep them cutting perfect.  Fiskars actually has a lifetime guarantee against any defects in workmanship.  For under $35.00, these are a must have for saving my back and knees with the constant maintenance of yard trimming. These are not just for older people, as I've always had bad knees- and I wish I had known about these years ago!The thought of trimming all the constant grass around the yard made me not want to do it. I'd have to get out my small shears, my knee pad or a stool to sit on- depending on the height of the grass or weeds. Afterwards, I'd need my heating pad and linament for my aching back and knees, not to mention Aleve or some other pain killer. Spending so much time in pain made me dread trimming. Now, I just grab the Fiskars Long Handled Shears- stand, trim and that's it. These shears are worth much more than 5 STARS, and I know I will never be without them again, as saving my back and knees are worth everything!
B00004SD6Y Fiskars badly missed the target on this one.  Kudos to them for trying to fill the niche though, but in all honesty, this is almost as bad as having nothing at all.  Yes, it does work, but not very well. Yes, it's sharp out of the box, but won't stay that way for long.  I'll take a wild guess and say that no one in their R&D; department actually used the finished product.  If they did, they'd realize that it's an effective trimmer for 10 sq feet of grass (maybe less).  After that, ergonomics, build quality, and most importantly, fundamental design flaws reveal how a great idea can become a poorly executed product.First, the blades need to ride above the grass by way of wheels or some sort of slick bump underneath.  Second, the steering knob needs to be larger, adjustable, and attach to the pole instead of the top handle.  Third, the gauge of wire should be beefed up - there's too much flex in the existing one.  Fourth, the pole should be at least 4\" longer. Fifth, the quality of plastic could be upgraded for use in a harsher environment (or dispose of plastic altogether).  Lastly, the blades should at the very least, be made out of steel -- bonus points for drop forged and hardened!I completely understand the price point vs quality quandary manufacturers face, but here they really took the low-end, budget approach.  It seems Fiskars tried to implement their fine line of inexpensive scissors to the lawn/garden environment.  The quality of materials is perfectly suited for indoor gardening, but who here has a living indoor lawn?I guess we'll have to give it a little more time before human-powered lawn equipment becomes available in a wider selection and price points.  I'd definitely be one of the first in line for a better version.
B00004SD72 I gave these only three stars because of how they do and feel in your hand.  They will slip in your hand because there a bit slick and hard to hold.  There ok for small cuts and not having to use them a lot at one time.I wouldn't buy these if i had it to do over again.
B00004SD72 I finally broke down and bought a more expensive pair of pruners than usual. The blades on these are great! Small branches and more cut easily, quickly and cleanly. They are certainly a lot more comfortable to hold than the cheap $7 sheers I've purchased in the past.My biggest issue with them so far is the orange hold-close tab broke almost immediately. They have a life time warranty, but of course I threw away the receipt and all of the packing materials.
B00004SD72 This is a great pruner.  It is easy on arthritic hands and is quite sharp.  It works well on everything except larger branches.
B00004SD72 I think I have large hands for a woman but it takes two hands for me to make these pruners work correctly.  I do like the ergonomic aspect and the rolling handle that turns as you squeeze the handles together but it takes two hands for me to do that.8-21-13:  I came back and changed my 5-star rating to a 2-star because yesterday I picked up these shears and walked up the driveway and clipped some Sweet Autumn Clematis to bring that wonderful fragrance into the house.  However, I also clipped and really pinched my right index finger and I was trying to use these pruners with one hand.  They are just too large for me.  I think the swiveling handle is the culprit.  I tried to give them to one of my visiting left-handed brothers and he said no thanks.  They are good and sharp and all but brand new but just too big unless I can use both hands.
B00004SD72 Got to love a pruner that is ergonomically correct and puts pressure on the bush and not your thumb and forefinger.  Got to love a pruner that stays sharp after many seasons of work.  Got to love a pruner that stays rust-free even though we leave it out on the back porch.  Shouldn't come as a surprise:  We love anything Fiskars!
B00004SD72 I have used these for 4 years and love them.  First I'm 70 years old and do have some Arthritis so these are a real boon to me.  If I can get a branch between the blades I can cut it without strain. Strong spring that opens them (nice) but will say if you had small hands might be a bit large for you. The rolling handle took some getting use to, worked well but was different than anything I had used before, like it now though.  I would recommend these to anyone. I have several Fiskars tools, geared loppers, pruning poles etc., and that really is the reason I bought these since the others work great for me and all have held up to work.  When I read some of the bad reviews of these I have to remember some people need instructions on which end of a knife to hold while using.  These let me trim faster and with less effort than anything I have ever used,  believe me I've used several and cussed most of them.  Fiskars also makes others that are smaller in size if these are too large for you.  No I don't work for Fiskars, just totally impressed and sold on their loppers and pruners.
B00004SD72 These pruners are very easy on your wrists (and I have wrist problems)! They really do cut through limbs just like the photo in the images section! My pruners are on their 3rd summer with little maintenance required. When these finally bite the dust, I'll replace them with another Fiskars PowerGear Pruner. I am right handed and tried using the pruners with my left - it doesn't really work as one reviewer noted.
B00004SD72 This the next best thing to having a full size lopper in the palm of your hand. It's very strong with a power gear mechanism that makes cutting painless.  Because of the power gear action, the trigger handle rotates, softening the blow when the sheers get through the branch.  With traditional sheers, the snapping action can be painful after an hour or two of heavy duty pruning.These are heavy pruners, the grip is very comfortable.  I've only had these for two years, but it's going strong.  I wouldn't recommend it for professional u because of the exposed coil spring which is likely get clogged or damaged under heavy abuse, but it's great for the home owner.This performs the job of countless other cutting implements (small sheers to a medium duty lopper).  It's not a delicate cutter, but until recently, I was using it to deadhead my flowers with good results.
B00004SD72 I have been doing yard work for 40 years, so I am no \"backyard rookie\".  This pruner fell apart the very first time I used it. The \"PowerGear\" fell off and couldn't be reattached firmly to the pruner. I have used other Fiskar products many times and had normal expectations confirmed.Despite what a few other reviewers might say, everyone has the right to state accurate facts about a faulty product. Poor products deserve bad reviews, both to inform the manufacturer and to warn prospective purchasers about problems encountered. Amazon expects no less.I have processed the return package to send it back to Amazon and will try another unit. That said, I reserve the right to change my opinion should the second unit function properly.
B00004SD72 I've had this pruner for several years, and I've used it for a variety of tasks, including pruning roses and other bushes, to trimming off small tree branches. I've even used it for branches that were probably too thick for the tool, but when you have it handy, sometimes you use a tool for a purpose that it wasn't intended. Even when I try to go through something too large, it hasn't broken or jammed in such a way where I couldn't remove it and take it from another angle to finish the cut. That shows how durable it really is.I've had no issues with using this pruner for all those tasks, as it allows me to trim individual faded rose buds with one hand. The spring-loaded handle keeps the resistance at the right amount so it isn't necessary to fiddle around with it just to keep a decent grip.If I were to lose this pruner, or if it were to finally break, I would not hesitate to purchase another one as a replacement. I'm very satisfied with it and recommend it to anyone looking for this type of tool.
B00004SD72 When I placed my order I had some misgivings about these hand pruners. That is because I could not tell by Amazon's photo if this was the pruner I needed and how sturdy it is. Since I have had good luck with Fiskars I decided to go ahead and order it.I received the pruners today and I am going to break one of my rules on writing a review. I prefer to wait and use the product before doing a review. I am doing this because these are obviously TOP QUALITY pruners. Arthritis sufferers please take note of what I am about to say.The very first thing I noticed about the pruners is that the bottom handle ROTATES as you squeeze them. This allows you to put far more power into using these with a LOT LESS effort. A wonderful feature if you do not have a strong grip.The photo made these pruners look to me like they were mostly plastic. I immediately saw that I was wrong. All the parts that count are of high quality metal. I will not use them on large branches but I think they could be used on large branches in a pinch.As soon as I got them out of the box I just had to try them. They were excellent for clipping off very small branches in areas where there was not much room to operate. They are SO EASY to use. Once done with the smaller branches I went to larger ones. They cut them with ease. The literature that came with them claimed that they can cut branches up to 3/4 inch. I believe they could but I refuse to do it. I like these clippers so well that I want to take very good care of them so that means I will not cut branches that size with them. I want these clippers to last a long time for me.In conclusion I am very impressed with these clippers. I intend to post some of my own pictures of these clippers on Amazon because I believe I can do a bit better job. I have never done that before with an Amazon product. That is how impressed I am with these pruners. If I run into a problem with them I WILL EDIT this review as soon as it occurs. I very much doubt I will have to do that. I think 99% of all people who buy these pruners will be happy with them.
B00004SD73 I needed a pruner to fight bittersweet vine.  Due to several back surgeries I don't have a lot of strength in my hands, so I was looking for a pruner that was light and easy to use.  I got this 15\" Fiskars pruner this weekend in local home improvement store and spent several hours cutting my pesky vines.  The pruner worked great! It cut every vine I found and it was easy!The pruner weights 13 ounces, and has a PowerGear design that really helps amplify the strength needed to do the cutting.  I am attaching a collage of 5 photos (you can find the photos by following 'customers photo' link under the main photo).  The photos show the pruner and some of the vines I cut and took home to measure.Photo #1 and photo #2 show the pruner opened and closed. Photo #3 and Photo #4 show one of the bigger vines I have cut: 3 inches in circumference and a bit over 7/8 inches in diameter. Photo #5 shows the vine that was snaking up one of my big fur trees.Overall, I am very pleased. This pruner was easy to use and did a good job!Ali Julia review
B00004SD73 These are great.  Had the old ones for years and I confess, they were occasionally abused.  I took a sharpener to the blade and got a few more miles out of them before deciding I needed to break down and buy new ones.  Works on branches that were surprisingly large (sorry!) but I hope to treat these better than the old ones.
B00004SD73 It had been years since I had a new pruner and the one I have most would consider \"vintage\".  So when I chose this pruner, I chose on the brand I know has quality and endurable products.  This pruner is lightweight and sharp.  I didn't realize how good a pruner can when when you have one that works!
B00004SD73 I used this product to trim shrub and tree branches around my yard. I can easily carry it around the yard because it is the perfect length and is light weight. I will also note that the blades are sharp and pinch through branches with ease. The Fiskars trimmer is a great addition to any garden cart especially if you want a quality trimmer for all your yard work needs.
B00004SD73 This little tool is deceiving.  It can cut those thick branches in one swipe.  My husband even uses it.  It is a big surprise what it can cut with no effort.
B00004SD74 Finally a decent pair of loppers. Quality construction. I love the gear setup and handles that won't come loose.They are a breeze to use.
B00004SD74 The gear mechanism does assist your chopping power.This is a solid branch cutter and as long as you clean your cutting edges,the tool should operate for a long time.
B00004SD74 cuts through branches like butter, not needing a lot of force at all.  super sharp and the design makes it take less energy to get it done
B00004SD74 These Fiskars are the very thing to have on hand, They cut really good and smooth. I like the long reach too because the short ones you will need a ladder more for taller trees.
B00004SD74 OK, I ordered these because I have some hand pruners by Fiskars and love them. These did not disappoint. I have been using them all over our new yard to cut back overgrown lavender, smoke bush, and branches. Today I thought I'd give them a try in the woods next to the house that \"could\" be a beautiful fire pit or gazebo area... eventually. I took these through dead and alive saplings. And to clarify-these were 1\"-3\" saplings. While it handled the recommended size of 2\" easily, I found with some maneuvering and going around the tree in a circle I could also take down larger ones. Then I worked on cutting the smaller branches off, all still cutting with ease like they were brand new. No dulling or sticking- a perfect cut each time.I worked at this for about an hour- plus all the other times I've been out with these... I would definitely buy another pair in the future - but these don/t seem like they will be wearing our anytime soon!
B00004SD74 I cut down two very dead shrubs today using these and was very impressed with these lightweight loppers.  I didn't think I'd get the heavier two-inch branches cut because these loppers are so light, but with the right grip the gear holds the wood down and cuts the branch cleanly in half with little effort.  I'm not the strongest person out there and I'm certainly no Hercules, but these loppers made the trim job for me fairly easy.Although these may be harder to use in dense shrub because you need a wide opening for these to work effectively, once you have a grip on the wood the cutting is easy.  And, since they are somewhat long, you can also reach up rather high.  Overall, a very well-engineered set.They are attractive on top of it, and look impressive in my tool corner.
B00004SD74 Fiskars 32 Inch PowerGear Bypass Lopper (9154).  Now this is a great Lopper, I use it a lot and it makes trimming easy.
B00004SD74 Love it, one of best products I have ever ordered period. I couldn't believe how effordless this thing cuts thru even thick branches several inches wide. It is very easy to use, light in weight but very solid construction and feel,  even makes cutting branches fun if you can believe that. I cut down twenty branches and three small trees in under a few minutes. I was looking around for more things to cut. Seems very well built. I can't think of a single thing that could have added on this thing to make it better Price is great. One reviewer gave it one star because the blade is curved so you have to open the tool's jaws slightly more. I am not sure but would bet the curved blade has something to do with just how easy this thing cuts. I have another cutter that doesn't have curved blades and it can't cut nowhere near as powerful as this tool. Tool is fantastic. Very Highly recommend Many Times over!!! Would give it twenty stars if could!!!! Good job to the people who designed this product!!
B00004SD74 There is power to spare with this lopper. Yes, it has to open very wide to get around the cutting target but if the space permits you to do so the cutting part is almost effortless. This is hands down the best lopper I have ever used as far as ease of cutting. When I finished clipping I decided to apply a bit of oil from the Fiskars Cutting Tool Care Kit that I had purchased. As I was applying the oil I noticed that the black cutting blade had a bright spot. Closer inspection revealed the bright spot was actually a nick in the blade. This was a major letdown after the feeling that resulted from the cutting prowess. I had to delete a star due to the nick and hope that it was just a  rare flaw in the metal. Other than the nick this is a top notch lopper.
B00004SD74 This 32 inch loppers is a great addition to our yard work tools!! I am a short lady, and have no problem snipping branches around our yard. The long sturdy handles make it easy to get leverage and trip harder to reach branches, and I have seen great improvement in our curb appeal because of this great loppers!
B00004SD74 This is a great addition to my growing gardening tool collection.  This tool will make it easier to prune tall tree limbs in the fall.  The Fiskars quality in sewing instruments in why I purchase the brand for my outdoor activities.
B00004SD74 I bought it in a local store on sale, for $29.99, mine is the same model, only 32\". Funny, because on the fiskars website there's no mention of the product!I compared it to other alternatives, that can cut 2\" branches, and this model came out as number one!It cuts wood like butter!Mine is very light weight, has titanium blade, hollow aluminum arms, with rubber handles.I fear I bought a product that may be more powerful than the product can actually handle! Meaning, it may be good for casual use of cutting branches upto 2\".But perhaps not industrial use!That's why they probably decreased the size of the gripper to 25\" and 31\" instead of 32\".Nevertheless, I just use it for some thorn bushes in my garden, and think it's well worth the $30 I spent!Even mine (32 inch) is very light weight, I can easily lift it up with one arm stretched, to cut off the furthest branches, and I'm a pretty skinny and weak guy!One cutting blade seems titanium, the other some sort of treated metal alloy. Only one of the two is a blade, the other is just a hold for the branch.Unlike other branch cutters I've seen, this one cuts the branch like a scissor, not squeezes the branch like pliers; which means, you won't have branches hanging on threads still on the tree.The cutting mechanism provides clean and easy cuts that separate even the toughest branches (upto 2 inch)!I highly recommend this one!; and that's very high praise coming off of my lips! (those who know me, know I'm usually very skeptic, and thorough in reviewing the bad sides).If anything bad about this device, is that it's not on the manufacturers website (the 32 inch model), and that it's probably not made for mass pruning on an industrial scale, eventhough it would probably outlive a DIY-er pruning gardens in his days off!
B00004SD74 I've usually found Fiskars gardening products to be innovative and effective, but there's usually a kink in the design.  I still swear by the Power Lever shears because the blades move parallel and effortlessly, but the kink is the retaining pin which is a pressure fit which simply loosens with use as the hole in the blades enlarge.  As to this very lovely and innovative Power Gear lopper, well, let's say there are a lot of kinks.  As you may have discovered, the handles break and the blades are fragile.  Just how fragile?  Check Home Depot's website for feedback on this very lopper and you'll even see pictures of the chipped Titanium blade.  It happens a lot, a whole lot.  Quality control may well be to blame, but the material used in the titanium blade is just not solid or steel.  My blade broke or rather chipped the first week of use and the broken surface revealed something that looks like pot metal.  The material in the blade looks like a composite, a grainy composite.  If you look at the blade you'll see that's it's very hefty and designed to withstand a direct applied force, but apparently not a force related to twisting, which would act against the cutting edge with increased leverage due to the unusual depth of the blade and its almost rectangular shape.  So you have high tech materials that when working, operates as advertised, save for that extra span needed to clear the blade around let's say a 2 inch branch.  BUT here's the good news:  Fiskars has replacement blades.  Here's the not so good news:  Fiskars charged me a reasonable $7.99 for the blade, but a very, very hefty shipping and handling ($4.00 for the handling) charge of $11.39, making the modestly priced blade $19.38 to purchase and receive.  The replacement blade (they're determined by the distance between the mounting holes)is steel and shaped like traditional lopper blades:  no more composites, no more thick blades, which tells you something.  As to Power Gear hedge shears, well , count your blessings with the lopper, because there ain't no replacement parts for the hedge shears from Fiskars, and their kink is the composite Power Gear mechanism, which breaks teeth with a passion, rendering the unit useless, unless you have a similarly wounded twin, because the mechanisms are comprised of two sets of power gear parts, that are interchangeable front and rear.  There you go, have fun.
B00004SD74 This tool makes unpleasant pruning tasks much more pleasant and the ease of cutting makes the work a lot more pleasant!  (If you can bear to think of it that way!)  It really takes the effort out of cutting thick branches.  I carry this lopper along with my smaller pruner--and I don't struggle trying to use the pruner on bush that's too thick for it.  Makes the whole pruning job go faster.I use this on our numerous rose bushes, too.  The length comes in real handy when I'm trying to avoid the thorns.In our neck-of-the-woods, we'll be pruning our roses in mid-February.  So now is not too early to start thinking about Spring-time gardening chores.
B00004SD74 Boy this looper is sharp and strong.  My wife uses it and loves it.  The gearing is amazing strong.  We have cut tree branches about 2 inches and no problem
B00004SD74 This is an excellent pruner/lopper and the rachet allows extra pressure on the blades when needed. Well made and rugged.
B00004SD74 Bought these to trim some larger bushes and small branches on a big pine tree.  These loppers work perfectly fine and are fairly light.  Although they seem to be a little more expensive, they are built well and should last a long time.  Remember to oil the blade and hinge after use, to keep it working properly and to prevent rust.
B00004SD74 Alright then, these are amazing at what they will cut with very little effort on my part.  Quality made! Save yourself the aggravation of lesser loppers. Just get these and be done with it.
B00004SD74 These do everything the company says.  I was surprised at how easy larger limbs were to cut compared to my old loppers.  My wife tried these and was really pleased at how easy it was to cut limbs.  (Hint, Hint, guys)  Let me say I would not have tried to cut some of the big limbs with my old loppers (now gone to lopper heaven).  If the jaws of these loppers fit around a limb they will cut it and so can you.  Only once did I have a problem opening them (handles) wide enough to fit a limb inside a shrub, it was a big one.  Most of the time I could find an angle to reach through with and cut inside limbs with no problem.  I would recommend these to anyone who like me enjoys easy work.  At 66 years old and surviveing throat cancer surgery I need that too.
B00004SD74 I have owned this thing for years.  It is hands-down my all-time favorite gardening tool.  I used to use your old-school loppers which became tiring to use and had trouble cutting thick branches.  I was in Home Depot one day and decided to spend the big bucks and get this thing.  It was my first Fiskars purchase ever, and ever since then I have been SOLD on this company.  These loppers are AMAZING.  I can cut branches, even tree roots, thicker than ever before with ease.  The gears on this thing make it possible to use this for a long period of time without tiring your arms as much.  Very efficent and effective tool.  Easily my favorite most-effective gardening tool I've ever bought.  I highly recommend this to you if you are in the market for some loppers.  Or if you know someone who likes to mess around the yard (especially older folks - this is so much easier on the joints), then get this as a gift.  It's just the best!** UPDATE 12/11/2102 **I just bought this as a gift for someone this Christmas. They work outdoors around the house and actually were using these same loppers, but they were 16 years old at that point (the loppers, not the person!).  They hadn't cared for them or sharpened them and they are in really bad shape.  So - a replacement is what they're getting for Christmas!  I do still love these things!
B00004SD74 I just used these to cut up some pine branches that came down in a horrendous windstorm and they WORKED LIKE A CHAMP!!! No effort and it cut through 2\" branches effortlessly. I am so glad I happened upon the Gold Deals when they were featured. They even came in ONE day. Thanks Amazon!!!Fiskars 9154 PowerGear 32-Inch Bypass Lopper
B00004SD74 The leverage you get from this looper is insane!  The gear pivot gives you a lot of leverage to cut through anything that'll fit in the blade when opened.  The only trick is making sure you open the handles WIDE in order to fit branches.
B00004SD74 Trees and shrubs grow year-round here in Hawaii, and trimming is a constant job. I much prefer using this&#8212;no cords, more control and a bit of exercise&#8212;over an electric trimmer.
B00004SD74 it looks like a well made high quality piece of equipment. brand new right out of the box both handles fell off. i guess i can glue them back on but this is a brand new tool under warranty.update: i glued the two handles onto the metal arms. it works great. it is very powerful. i like it. it has enough leverage that it can do the big jobs easily.
B00004SD74 I think I have three or four, maybe more. I'd have to go up into the attic to check. These work better than my Felcos which is saying a lot.
B00004SD74 Great piece of equipment for the price!  They are very light weight and has plenty of power torque behind it.  I would definately buy another one of these in the future!
B00004SD74 This lopper has actually exceeded my expectations. The only reason you buy one of these is to lop off tree branches and limbs, as well as extra bush and vine growth. This thing requires no real strength to use whatsoever, and i have now lopped limbs as much as three inches in diameter with no problems at all. Definitely well worth the $30 or so that they currently costs. Helped me to clear a lot of extra growth in no time.Enjoy!
B00004SD74 I purchased this at Home Depot.  It can cut 2\" or even 2.5\" branches with relative ease.  But there is one issue.  The cutting blade broke at some point.  I didn't notice it until I had problems getting the cut to go all the way through.  However, I went to the Fiskars website [...] and found out the live chat button and explained the issue to the customer rep.  She sent a new one out that day and I received it in 3 business days.  Installing the new blade was very easy and it worked just great.Over all, this lopper is a joy to use.  The movement is smooth and the cuts are clean.I wonder if Amazon will ever sell the replacement blade, though.
B00004SD74 I do a lot of gardening and I've owned a lot of loppers. These are the first that I've been totally pleased with. They are super sharp and will easily cut branches up to 2 inches in diameter. I also like the way the blades are designed and the way they \"grip\" the branch. I've been using them for 6 months now and I've never noticed them getting stuck inside a cut. They really make your work a lot easier and even pleasurable.
B00004SD74 It cuts easily through pretty large branches. It takes very little force to cut even large branches. If you have a lot of large trees (we do), you will still need a pole saw and/or chain saw, but this gets the most total use.All of my garden tools are Fiskars and I am very happy with each of them.
B00004SD74 Because of the length and the power gear, you have to spread your arms wide in order to make this 2\" cut, which can be troublesome in many cases, if you ever come across a power gear2 design, i'd suggested you buy it instead, a 27 inch power gear2 also cuts 2\" while your arms don't have to do spread eagle all afternoon, this one serves the purpose, but tiresome after 15 minutes.
B00004SD74 I had to buy this when the trail blazer was delivered to me defective in its assembly.  By leaving out a washer, the trail blazer bent out of shape when you tried to cut something over an inch.  This one handles up to about 1 1/2 inch stuff just fine.  It is not a ratcheting one so it might require a little more effort but it does do the job.
B00004SD74 Fiskars has given me great service over the years, so while I didnt used to have brand loyalty to any particular lawn tool maker, I now buy their products when available.  They're all well made and work well, this is no exception.  The gear drive is smooth and powerful, and as you might expect from a company with its roots in expensive scissors the blades are exceptional and dont need frequent sharpening.  Make sure to spritz a little wd-40 or other light lube on this and any tool with moving parts before using, it'll make them last longer, work better and prevent rust.
B00004SD74 I love how powerful these are.  I have cut up to 1.5\" diameter with this...any larger than that and I reach for a saw.My only complaint is that to get the large branches, you have to open the handles up all the way due to the power gear (almost180 degrees apart).  The limiting factor is cutting branches is whether I can open the handles far enough apart where I'm working.
B00004SD74 The 3:1 gearing helps these loppers cut quickly, BUT it also means that the handles have to open three times wider than ungeared loppers.  if you're trimming an outside branch, that's not a problem, but I've found them almost impossible to use when trimming branches next to tree trunks and in other dense foliage.If you choose to buy these, make sure that you also have some regular loppers around or you're going to be muttering to yourself a lot.
B00004SD76 I bought these a year ago but hadn't used them much.  I just began using them this spring and loved them - would have given them five stars until today.  Ironically I just ordered another pair yesterday because they are so easy to use - lightweight and sharp.But today the orange clamp that keeps them closed when not in use no longer does its job and they stay open all the time which makes them bulkier to carry as they are much less compact with both blades and handles splaying out.  That's the reason for only 3 stars. After today's malfunction I wouldn't order them again.  Plus the price has gone up in a year from $8.68 to $11.79. They are VERY useful - I just wish they were sturdier.
B00004SD76 I've had several of these from various manufacturers. I can't add a lot to the other reviews except to say that(1) they are very capable and surgically precise for pruning. They can handle quite large cross-sections as long as the material is not woody or hard. For example, they're perfect for pruning back conifers to the next junction, even 1/4 in. dia. so long as the material is \"softish\", and(2) Do not put them away in your pocket or tray or tool shelf without putting the \"sheath\" on the tip, because these are a very sharp and finely pointed weapon when locked closed. You can get a bad wound when you sit down, or crouch, or bend over if these are in a pocket unprotected.If you lose the little protective tip. use a wine bottle cork. It's greatThat said, they're probably my favorite, or one of my two, favorite pruners. Of many.
B00004SD76 These pruners are durable, having a locking mechanism, a protective sheath, and are quite sharp (don't run your finger against them too hard!).They make it easy do get into dense foliage, and get a perfectly angled, clean cut. Enough said.
B00004SD76 These Fiskars Consumer Prod 99216935 Pruning Snips are a good cutting little garden snip.  They are made from a stainless steel with good handles.  Fiskars products are a quality offering and these are perfect for caring for you home or yard plants pruning and upkeep.  I love them.  My wife does also and now they are hers!
B00004SD76 I have to say,I was a little worried that either the spring was going to go,or just something was going to happen to these perfectly priced trimmers.And after using these lil guys off n on for several months now,these things are worth thier weight in gold,I tell ya.LOL!Comfy,sharp and easy to clean as well.Excellent price and an even BETTER deal.
B00004SD76 These were purchased to replace a larger hand trimmer which I used on my hanging plants, herb garden, seasonal flowers, small shrubs and bushy perennials.These do a very good job on anything that would fall under the category of small and/or delicate because it has a thin and long cutting blade that makes it ideal when you want to trim something without chancing taking out half the foliage. It makes taking off snips of dill easy without damaging the plant or taking off too much.  It is also precise if you are selectively trimming small sections.The handles have a spring action device that requires almost zilch pressure and is comfortable and easy to use even when mounting a morning of garden maintenance. I used it for two hours today and my hands felt fine ----- no stiffness or discomfort.The cost is appealing. Small garden tools can get pricey and since I paid about $8 for these I thought they were reasonable.
B00004SD76 Sharp and precise pruning snips are here!  I used these pruning snips for my roses and mums.  I love the spring action handle as this was a great idea.  The tool is light-weight and the quality of Fiskars is one I can rely on.  The size is great and easy to carry with you when you have many plants to prune.  For those family members that like to borrow things and don't bring back, I labeled my snips \"Mom\" so know one can use them without my permission as I want these back!
B00004SD76 I have owned many pairs of this exact trimmer and will continue to do so. I lose them every 3-4 months. I have no idea how or why but i do. So i continue to purchase more. They are tight gripped, the spring is of high quality and will not wear after repeated long use. The shears are sharp and can get into tight spaces (what we need it for). For $11, this is one of the best trimmers you can buy. Enjoy and happy trimming
B00004SD76 I find that the tiny tips allow me to get to right spot to snip off the pepper that I want with slicing up the surrounding leaves and stems.  Nice, precise and small to fit.  Much easier harvest.
B00004SD76 I'm a landscaper, so I use these snips for deadheading fussy annuals like violas and petunias.But I used to work at a Humboldt County, CA nursery, and, um... I was probably the only person ever to buy a pair of these for legal purposes! Seriously, this is the gold standard for pot-growers who need to do trimming. What kind of trimming? Durn if I know, but I've seen them at yard sales coated with the sticky sap, and the local growers used to buy stacks of these nippers with their smelly cash, so...If you need it for either purpose, then these are the best. I've tried other brands and didn't like them as well. Keep in mind this is for cutting thin, tiny deadheads. It's not a pruning shear, it's for very detailed deadheading or nipping of very small stems.If you're doing a lot of delicate pruning like this, I'd also recommend picking up some of those thin Atlas Nitrile Touch gloves. Best gloves for tactile sensation while doing fine work.
B00004SD76 I'm really weary of buying things that are made in China. Fiskars is located in the USA. I'm unclear on the reason (RICH EXECUTIVES AND GREEDY BOARD OF DIRECTORS) why they would manufacture these snippers in China. Brings me down.Anyway. These are QUITE nice, very lightweight -- you will not be cutting anything more than thin plant material with these BUT they do reach in very nicely, nice thin blades. This operates on a naked steel wire spring, not a coiled spring, so I'm curious how long these are going to last. Comes with a thoughtful little orange plastic cone for the business end of the snippers.These are significantly superior to bonsai-type snippers or repurposed manicure scissors. Ideal for deadheading flowers. I love garden tools and these snippers are a real treat.
B00004SD76 I bought these to trim my weeds buds.  Works real nice, and the are small enough to get in and get those smaller leafs.
B00004SD76 We know that we should not pull beans off the vine if we want the plant to continue bearing.  In the past, we have used small scissors to snip, but often the blades were too short to reach back into the plant and we were knocking off tender young buds.When I saw these snippers, I did not hesitate a moment:  I bought two pair.  (Of course, I didn't want to steal all the fun of harvesting our green beans, so I bought my husband his own pair...)We love Fiskars products--they are sturdy and built to last and blades are good and sharp.  Blades stay sharp for a long time, then take very well to a sharpener.Regarding bonsai:  This snipper is too large for bonsai work:  The blades are not fine and small and exact enough.I did find another Fiskars snipper, a bit longer in the handle and the blades, that I find better for using on roses.  Longer handles and longer blades keep my fingers further away from the thorns and that's a good thing.  I looked for that product here on Amazon, but didn't find it.  I just mention it so you can be on the lookout.  The handles are different and there is a hook on the bottom of the handles to hold them together.UPDATE July 2013:  We now have only one pair...I used it to snip a small Japanese eggplant and one of the blades snapped right at the joint.  It is very vulnerable at the joint because of the hole that is drilled in each blade where they are joined together.  So, it's still a great snipper for very delicate things, but nothing more.
B00004SD76 I bought these to trim the leaves from my cannabis flowers and they work well for that. For any jobs that require more strength, get yourself something bigger/stronger.They're not perfect, they're not for heavy-duty cutting, and they're made in China.But they cut. I kept a cotton ball and some rubbing alcohol around to clean the trichomes off the blades periodically and had no problem getting through my entire crop. My hands were sore,  but you'll have that after trimming a pound and a half of high quality cannabis.  To help ease the pain, I smoked some cannabis. Worked for me.*I am a fully RCW 69.51a compliant medical cannabis patient*
B00004SD76 I'm into bonsai and I have (don't tell my wife) hundreds invested in bonsai tools. This is my go-to snipper. No it doesn't get used like it would in a commercial nursery, but, hey, it's a cheap, little, freaking scissor. I don't gunderstand the negative posts. It does what it does and it does it VERY well. I use it a few times a week for light trimming and it's perfect.
B00004SD76 I got this for me, but gave it to my wife.  I wanted something heavy-duty for cutting vines, etc. in our wooded area, but these work better for gardening / cutting fresh flowers.  I was looking for something more \"beefy\", but this seemed a little delicate for my use. My wife does enjoy this very much for her small garden.  It was likely my fault for buying this product for something that it was not intended for; and it does work very well for what it was designed to do.  I liked the rubber tip cover for when you throw it in your pocket.  I do wish that you could hang this up on a peg-board, but there's no opening to do this with, and the blades are heavier than the handle so it would hang tip down.  Instead we have to throw it in the \"gardening tool drawer\" where it is slightly more difficult to find.UPDATE: after one season of use, my wife has broken these sheers cutting in the vegetable garden.  She admits that the item that was being cut was too big for the sheers, but they should be more durable.
B00004SD76 This extremely sharp tool with its long narrow blades (and the neat safety cap that protects the blades) has been one of the handiest tools I have used in my greenhouse and garden.  I've used it for over a year and it remains sharp and the spring action remains reliable.
B00004SD76 These pruning snips are fantastic. They are super light and easy to use. The handles are comfortable and the spring action is extremely nice, even after heavy use. I really like the cases that cover the blades when they are being stored. My lefty husband and I (right-handed) can easily share them. I highly recommend them!
B00004SD76 I love these snips for pruning and cleaning up plants in my greenhouse.  The tips and blade are very sharp, so use with caution.
B00004SD76 I always have this tool on me when I'm in the yard.  It's perfect for dead heading dense flowering plant without accidentally snipping the neighboring blooms.  It has a very sharp and strong blade so you can cut only using the very tip of the sheer.  Because the point is so narrow and sharp, it comes with a orange rubber sheath to protect the blade while it's in your pocket.My only gripe with this tool is the flimsy orange clasp which breaks off very easily if you are not careful.  I've owned several copies of these sheers and I've manage to break off the clasp on all three of them by clipping branches a little larger than recommended.  Fortunately, the orange sheath keeps the blades closed, assuming you don't loose it.
B00004SD76 Perfect pruners for tiny work.  Very very sharp all the way to the tip.  Spring loaded for easy use. Would reccomend.
B00004SD76 This is my most used tool.  I keep it hidden by the kitchen sliding doors so when I go to get that rose, it's there.  It's the perfect flower cutter and comes with an orange cap to cover the blades.
B00004SD76 I have never run across a Fiskars product I did not love. These small pruners are no exception.  I found them ideal for pruning houseplants and shrubs (like azaleas) that produce small flowers and need regular deadheading.  They are a perfect fit to get between stems throughout plant. Not recommended for thorny type plants, like roses. I have every fiskars tool that I have purchased or inherited.
B00004SD76 Great trimmming sissors for a great price.....Gets right in were i needto go to trim with out getting my hands dirty and snips off cleanly..Lovem
B00004SD76 These are great for fine detail snipping.I wouldn't use them to prune a very thick branch,but for leaf work its great.
B00004SD76 Just the right size for indoor plants.  Stays sharp as long as you keep it clean.  It's a good price.
B00004SD76 I had to go with 4 stars because Amazon stated it was 7-inches long in the description but it's only 6-inches. I checked the Fiskars Website and they show it correctly at approximately 6\" in length... but it's exactly that length and the cutting edge is 2\". I have a large hand and the length does make a difference for me and I kept pushing the locking lever closed because my hand covers it and my thumb pushes the latch forward. I did trim some lilac bushes with it and it's pretty easy to use, feels the same in either the left or right hand and is quite sharp. However, since I have about 30 more bushes to go I'm going with the larger pairFiskars 9920 Garden Multi-Snip with Sheathand these will fit much better in my wife's much smaller hand. If you have a small hand they you'll likely be going with 5 stars because I can't find any other issue with it.
B00004SD76 Fiskars just doesn't seem to be what it used to. These are alright but they do have problems. When pruning with the blades at a downward angle, the locking pin slides down and locks them when you are in the middle of using them. I've had to play with them and hold the locking pin back with my thumb while I use them. The blades cut well but I wouldn't say these are worth the price.
B00004SD7B I bout this after my power company felled a couple trees on my property that were encroaching on power lines. They cut them into 2-3 foot sections (and a couple 6-8 foot sections... thanks a lot!) and left them where they lay. I cut them into standard 16\" sections with a chainsaw and got to work on them (still pretty green) with this axe.First piece I hit was a smaller section, only about 8 inches or so thick and maybe 10 in diameter. I struck dead center on the first swing, and the halves flew apart about 6 feet, leaving me with my axe burried about 2 inches deep in my chopping stump. For the smaller length pieces like this, I only really had to let this axe fall with its own weight.On to the larger pieces...I put the first 16 inch log, about 10\" diameter, up on the stump and had a one-hit split on that one, too. Now, I'm not a big guy (5'6\"), and I have only split firewood 2 or 3 times in my life. My buddies showed me proper technique on a camping trip so I wouldn't cut my leg off, but that's all the training I had. I really only planned to test the axe out on a couple pieces and save the rest for another day, but it was so much fun splitting the wood with this axe, I finished the whole lot! Not all of them were one-strike splits, mind you, and some of the more twisted or knotty pieces gave me a little trouble. This is not a magic axe. But it got through everything, including pieces that came from where the tree bifurcated. Many of my splits ended with the axe burried in the stump I was chopping on, even after going through a nice 16\" log. Left me sweaty and smiling.I also like to smoke meat, so I used it to chop some of the scrap-sized logs into chunks for my smoker. It worked well for this, but I think I'm going to buy the x7 hatchet for that purpose in the future. This axe was a little too heavy and long-handled to easily take care of the smaller work. Still, I split a large box of wood chunks with it by \"choking up\" on the handle and am thrilled with the results.I would buy this again or recommend it to others in a heartbeat. I haven't truly put it through the paces yet, and I haven't had any (major) overstrikes, so I'll try to remember to update this review in the future to reflect any problems or continued success with it.
B00004SD7B What can I say? I'm no professional axe wielder, but this tool really does the job well.  Strong. Balanced. Light-ish.  I'm really pleased with it.
B00004SD7B I have never split firewood before. This thing works great for me so it should be tremendous for an experianced person. I did order the Fiskars sharpener and sharpened it before using. First swing I missed, after that POW!! a clean split every time. Used it for over an hour without a problem.
B00004SD7B Now this is a real splitting axe, have never used a good splitter axe.  This will splits Oak real fast and clean.  The long handle is just right for power splitting.  And yes I would buy it again!
B00004SD7B I've only been splitting wood for about 10 years, but in that time I've gone through 5 axes including this one. Two were regular axes, the fiberglass handle on the one split and frayed, the head on the other came off and was not repairable. Regular axes have their place, but if you're splitting all day long they are NOT what you want.I had an old school wooden splitting maul axe I got from a buddy that I used for about two seasons, and I thought it was the best thing ever. However it weighed over 12lbs. A great muscle builder, but not quite as fun when you get older. I came across a similar splitting maul at Lowes, TrueTemper. It was great that it only weighed 7lbs, and I found I could split more in a day with it using faster swings. After 4 seasons with that, constant resharpening, I came across the hardest Oak I've ever seen. I was really struggling with the TrueTemper, finding myself constantly having to take double swings to get through a piece (sometimes more). It was embarrassing almost, until I had a party one night and 4 different guys tried the axe on this tree and all failed equally. It was perfectly sharp and at the proper angle, I just couldn't easily get through the wood..Then I found this.. I instantly found myself just TEARING through the wood, like it was nothing. I honestly couldn't believe it. This axe is 6.25lbs, about 3/4lb lighter then the TrueTemper. So I could more easily, and with slightly more speed swing it. I think the key to it's victors is the angle of the blade and the maul/wedge. The blade edge (long ways) angles back towards the handle so when you strike the wood you don't have to compensate for the axe to hit it at the perfect angle (although depending on the wood height you still need to hit it right). Then the wedge is a much lesser degree of incline then the Lowes, that the maul has a chance of getting into the wood and pushing through before the maul starts splitting it apart. The Lowes one had a much steeper angle towards the edge of the blade, so it on really hard wood it was getting stuck there as soon as the blade touched the wood.There's honestly no other splitting maul options in my mind. I could never recommend anything other then this, because it is simply the best in all splitting situations. Other good points on it is :-corrosion resistant head steel (although please don't leave it outside, it will dual the edge)-hollowed out handle thats even more lightweight, but EXTREMELY strong-lifetime limited warranty-strong head through handle design, looks much more durable then your standard axe or maul-head cover to protect the blade and anyone/thing that might come in contact with it.I also recommend getting theFiskars 7861 Axe and Knife Sharpenerand hitting it frequently. I usually don't go more then a 1/4 of a cord without sharpening, sometimes an 1/8th. It definitely makes it a lot more easier to split - especially for hard or wet wood.
B00004SD7B My old, heavy maul frequently got stuck in the piece of wood.  This one bounces out until it splits, eliminating the effort to pull it back out of the wood and getting it part way into position for the next stroke.  I can also split larger pieces of wood with it.
B00004SD7B Never splitting wood before I went into this venture a bit nervous.  But I did end up splitting a 1/4 cord of wood from big logs rather easily.  I heard the trick was speed. However I found just the normal almost over the head with &#34;no extra push&#34; but having good control worked every time.  The bade did exhibit tiny chips, but I kept it sharpened as several recommended.  The price is great and it feels virtually impossible to break. Although I read some had broken the handle. I did over swing once but it did not seem to mark the handle. It did make me concentrate that much harder. I did find stepping back a half of step kept me from compensating as I bent coming forward. I am sure each person swing is a bit different.
B00004SD7B I've cut down hundreds of trees and have split all the wood by hand.  I've been through two different mauls, and this my friends, is the best I've used.  It's lighter, but it splits like a maul twice its weight.  I just wanted to try it out when I first got it, so I took a few pieces of some hardwood into the driveway just to see how far it would go down into the wood - I never expected it to slice completely threw and still have enough energy to makes a nice chip in the concrete.  All I can say is wow, I immediately went inside and ordered the 14\" and 8\" hatchets & fiskars sharpener.  I'm 6'4\" and yes, the first couple of strikes I noticed the difference in the length of the handle - however if you follow proper form when splitting wood, you are in absolutely no danger of hitting your shins or feet. I quickly became accustomed to the shorter handle and because of its design, it does not require the \"windup\" and force of the longer and heavier mauls.  Buy it.
B00004SD7B This is a great axe. It is the perfect length and weight for my husband and me. We use the axe to split wood for our fire pit in the back yard. The axe blade is very sharp, and I have found that the Fiskars axe sharpener (Fiskars 7861 Axe and Knife Sharpener) works amazingly to resharpen the blade any time it seems to get dull. The handle fits nicely in my hand and is comfortable when splitting wood. I love this axe and recommend it to all.
B00004SD7B Well balanced and comfortable. This axe does an excellent job splitting smaller to mid sized logs.Edge maintains with a lot of use.Handle seems unbreakable.A quality peice of equipment! Another fiskars winner.
B00004SD7B A great feeling splitting axe. Very comfortable in my hands and allows me to split wood easily. 
B00004SD7B Amazons service was a great. Even though I used Supersaver they shipped it right out using UPS and I got it 3 days later. Thanks Amazon.Let me say in general I despise Fiskar tools and never buy them. While some are very well designed the price point demanded by all you people who buy made in China or made India lousy products at Home Depot means Fiskar has to lower the price point to where the quality is not commercial. Fiskar tools in general are not commercial and I have destroyed or worn out every Fiskar tool in short order as I have a large property and commercial orchards and timber land and  my tools are heavily used especially by the 'help' that does not have to pay for the tools.In general I stick with Gransfour Bruks (Sweden), Vaughn (USA), Estwing (USA), Milwaukee (USA-electric saw), Silky Saws /cutting hatchets (Japan) or the professional Grade Husqvarna chainsaws when it comes to felling timber.I took down a big ponderosa pine and was splitting it green. My  near six pound maul was having problems with the big rounds as the wood was very wet. And it is a hassle to use a wedge and 8/10 pound hammer. And my 8 lb maul had a broken handle.Gransfour Bruks does not make an 8 lb maul. I checked the USA sources. No one made an 8 lb maul.I checked with Craftmans who while they do give a lifetime guarantee make their 8 lb Mauls in China now. So no 8 lb splitting mauls made in the USA anymore that I could find, if you know of one let me know. I have my old 8 pound maul head which was made by Craftsman in the USA but have to find a handle for it. Glad I saved the head now.China  is gutting the USA with its currency rigging and we send them fake paper money and they send lousy products with a lot of 'cheating' in the steel quality so fat cat Home Depot Shareholders and Fat Cat Chinese sweat shop owners is all you have and then you get a lousy axe and the \"opportunity' to make yourself poorer and Home Depot Shareholders and the Communist Chinese richer. And a sharp, well designed long lasting tool is the safest tool.Sad to see Craftsman Tools which are nearly commercial grade  go to China. People buying these cheap made in China tools at Home Depot or Sears are hurting us all and especially the people who need commercial grade tools or the 20 pc of America that is unemployed. It is unethical to buy tools made in communist china or india as they use slave labor and you're taking a job away from an American/Canadian and china/india rigs it currency to give its manufacturers the ability to drive USA quality vendors out of business. Buy local. It is 'greener' for this politically correct generation of MTV bra....er kids to buy local.I was very skeptical about the review about this axe, given my prior experience to wear out Fiskar tools in no time or have the help break them in no time,  but I ordered one against my better judgement as Fiskar tools are at least made in Finland which has good protection for labor. And the Finns have a big timber cutting industry they manage well so I suspected maybe the Axe was better or the Finns would just buy the Granfours Bruks' axes from Sweden. So the pressure was on Fiskars to come up with something world class. They surely delivered. This is a superb tool!!This axe is very, very well balanced and designed,  as well balanced and designed as the Gransfour Bruks splitting axe or splitting maul which is saying a lot. It splits like a dream and has the same splitting ability as an 8 lb maul at a much lighter weight which really, really surprised me. So it is particularly good for older people like me that are starting to have trouble with swinging the big mauls all day. The ergonomics are perfect for a 6 foot tall man. The blade keeps its splitting edge well. Splitting a Cord of Pine is near effortless. The only problem is I don't get the good workout anymore the splitting is so effortless. You might not even break a sweat splitting with this axe if you touch up the edge after every cord with a stone. I'm a strong big guy and I was splitting wet 1 foot ponderosa rounds with a 3/4 raise and one arm. It Split just from the gravity fall with the dull factory edge. Truly amazing. Not even my Gransfour splitting axe does that and they shipped it with a dull edge for safety when I tried the dull edge first cut test with just a one arm 3/4 raise. This axe was truly amazing once I put a professional edge on it and got after those 30 in rounds with no problems although you do need some skill to crack a wet 30 inch round on the first go.FYI - Never ever take a splitting axe or maul behind your head. Learn to split and/or you need to get a heavier axe. I never take ad axe behind my head and have never seen professional fallers or buckers to so at least back in the days when they did not have chainsaws and people learned how to use an axe properly.I would have preferred a leather sheath but the plastic one it comes with is very clever. Plastic is not good for the environment. You can always grow more cows or wood.The only question I have is if the handle well hold up and how easy it is to replace. Fiskar steel is better than average, not as good as say Silky Saw steel or Gransfours Bruk steel which is world class,  but it is as good as Estwing steel or Vaughn steel so it is great steel. This axe has a commercial grade head as far as steel quality. It is a great, great head.I gave it five stars as for the price you can't beat this splitting axe. For the homeowner or non professional  you cant beat this splitting axe and the only shame is that Vaughn or Estwing don't make a splitting maul or heavy splitting axe in the USA. This axe is the bomb as this generation says.The only question is how many 'years' of hard use can you get out of the axe handle for professional splitters. But you could buy 4 of these for the price of the Gransfour  maul and this splits better although Gransfours won't like to hear that. The Granfours of course last several generations the steel quality is so good so if you don't want to have your kids buy tools go with Granfours axes and maul if you can afford them. I inherited my grandfathers gransfour axes and I am an old man now and they still cut/split like they were new.Given what is available in the market for high quality 6-8 pound mauls not made in China or India or the third world  this splitting axe is the best choice for the home owner with a lot of wood to split especially big rounds. It really cracks those big rounds I was using a estwing wedge and 8/10 lb Vaughn sledge to break.Looks like they are selling enough of these I can get a new handle if it breaks and the handle is under warranty but I always misplace receipts. I'm going to put some coffee can tin underneath the head to extend the life of the handle as the head is a 'perfect' design. They should give a raise to the engineer who designed this axe. I will  buy a few more of these.In summary a superbly designed axe with capability to split equal to a good usa made 8 lb maul with near commercial quality ex for the handle and lack of a leather sheath. For the price you can't beat this tool and its made in  Finland where the government respects labor and not China or India nations looking to gut and steal USA and Canadian jobs by rigging their currency and employing child labor.Too bad about the cheap looking plastic sheath. A leather sheath and a commercial grade handle of top quality hickory would make this a forever tool and I would gladly pay $75 dollars or more to get the upgrade to the commercial handle and a good sheath. Gransfour is on the run with this axe at last. Heck I would pay 125 dollars for his head on a commercial grade handle it is that good.Thanks Fiskar. Thanks for providing us with an ethical buying choice and such a superb design. Fix your other tool lines and I will be a buyer. This makes up for all the other Fiskar tools I wore out or the help broke. So Fiskar owed me as I don't take back tools I wear out. That is my job to be a buyer and pay a fair price for high quality.This axe has HIGH QUALITY although its is nothing to look at as far as aesthetics. Only Gransfour makes beautiful axes anymore.
B00004SD7B This is the first Axe I have ever owned. (Not the first axe I have ever used.)  I am very pleased with it.  At first the head seemed to make the axe feel off balance and heavy, but as I got to using it, it helped get momentum building to make splitting the wood almost effortless.
B00004SD7B I have never picked up an axe in my life but in a few hours I split over a cord of wood.  This axe is incredible.  If you are on the fence, don't be!  Buy this axe now!!!
B00004SD7B If you&#8217;re looking for a well made axe and you don&#8217;t want to spend over a hundred dollars to get it then this is what you should buy!  I have beat the hell out of mine so far this wood season and so far I&#8217;ve gone through over 6 cords of tamarack pine and oak and this thing never seems to tire me out!  Love the light weight handle which is not cheaply made, but absorbs most of the off strikes and doesn&#8217;t seem the worse for wear, just some nice scars.  Holds an excellent edge and cuts through wood like a hot knife through butter.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!
B00004SD7B Had a tree cut down in the spring. Picked this guy up to make some firewood for the summer. It is comfortable in the hands and splits wood as if it was a mellon. I've even used it to cut down some Honeysuckle and a small tree. No problems what so ever. The product was shipped on time and packaged well.
B00004SD7B I bought the 36 inch Fiskars Splitting Axe based on the great reviews of it here early in the Spring of 2013.  I like the long handle and it works good for someone of my height (6 feet).  I can say this wood splitter has been as good as people say it is and is by far the best wood splitter I have owned.  I used to go though a wood handle on my old wood splitter every year because of wear and tear with an occasional miss of my target.  This wood splitter is far lighter and far more durable.  I have cut about 4 cords of wood with it so far and am very pleased with how it works.As many others point out, you will need to keep this sharp for it to work correctly, and I recommend getting the Fiskars 7861 Axe and Knife Sharpener along with this.  I sharpen it every hour or two of good use.  If I notice the wood isn't splitting well, I sharpen it again (it is easy to loose track of time when splitting wood).  I keep the cover on it at all times when not in use as this is not something you want to fall on anything accidentally.I want to thank everyone here for their insightful reviews, which got me to buy this and to Fiskers for making such a great product.  I have been splitting wood for about 10 years now and I only wish I knew about this product when I first started.  I cannot recommend this product enough!
B00004SD7B After splitting hundreds of cords of firewood, this is the best splitting maul that I've used.  The hollow handle cuts down on the weight and the efficient design of the wedge make splitting wood much easier.  I was able to split 3-foot cedar rounds relatively easily after failing to be able to with my old splitting maul.  I use the 36 inch handle, but sometimes choke up a bit to get more force.  This is an excellent design that allows you to split wood more quickly with less effort.
B00004SD7B This is an item I purchased based on reviews.  I barely looked at any other splitting axes.The reviewers were right.I am new to splitting, but watched some videos to learn.  This is a solid axe, yet the lightweight handle gives a great balance and reduces fatigue versus heavier, wood versions.  I have a lot of Fiskars tools so I know their plastic-composite is incredibly strong.  They also have a great warranty.In short, if you use this axe how you are supposed to, you will not have a problem splitting logs.
B00004SD7B With a yard full of cut oak and a 20-year-old axe, progress was slow until this dimwit figured out he needed a new axe. After a little bit of research I decided on the Fiskars X27 with the longer handle. After several days of chopping wood I am a believer. The axe arrived in a timely manner with a sharp edge burrowed safely in the protective, snug fitting head cover.Some of the oak sections left for me are 17-20 inches in diameter, an impossibility for my old axe. With the Fiskars I made quick work of a 17&#34; piece and an 11&#34; log today. In fact with three hits I was able to split the larger log right down the middle. For other pieces instead of hitting in the middle I chopped pieces off of the edges until the log was small enough to split in the middle.I like this new axe quite a bit. It's sturdy, nicely designed aesthetically, and cuts like nothing I've ever used before without needing the strength of Hercules. The Fiskars is just a little longer than my old axe and is just the right length for this 5 foot 10 inche amateur lumberjack. Occasionally I forgot about those few extra inches of length and hit my target with the axe handle. Eventually I learned to stand back just a little further.At first I wondered if any product could live up to so many positive affirmations. This axe does and for me is well worth the money.
B00004SD7B This Super Splitting axe does exactly what it's supposed to do.  The handle is unbreakable.  Really.  It has very good balance.  Perfect weight.  The shape of the handle fits the hand well, and the curve at the end of the handle makes gripping it easier.  It's very well designed.  It's the favorite of all the guys on the Arborist site.  Great tool  Great price on Amazon.
B00004SD7B Best combination maul/axe I have found.Sharp,lifetime guarantee,great ergonomics.Another Fiskars product that is well worth the money.Stlii made in Nordic Country,the quality and innovation shows.I like the Teflon coating a lot,no more prying out a stuck maul,it is so well balanced,it is fun again to Chop Wood!
B00004SD7B I wrote reviews on my other Fiskars products and this one is King of them All. I love this axe. With this woodsplitting axe you will not want to own any other splitter. This baby smashes through logs with one medium force swing. The logs explode. I couldn't believe how much wood I split the first day I had this axe. It comes with a great head cover, the axe is light and I think the handle is indestructible. Best money you will ever spend on an axe, especially for wood splitting. No wedges required.
B00004SD7B I got this to cut wood for camping and a backyard fire pit.  It's a great axe and the weight is about perfect.  I cut oak, hackberry, and mesquite.
B00004SD7B One of my many home defense weapons.  Not sure if I would grab this first but it could be fun.
B00004SDY5 + Doesn't leak+ Simple design+ Easy to connect/disconnect- A bit priceyOverall, very happy, these are nice!  I hope they last in the weather/sun.
B00004SDY5 Unfortunately nothing beats gardena. They kepp tight even after years and years of usage. connect as well as disconnect easy.My parents have some that are at least 20 years old and still fine.I am not sure how many attachments are available in the US but in Europe, this is the Rolls Royce of water hoses. You can get sprnklers, waterguns whatever you can imagine....and of course they are REALLY expensive.....well, you get what you pay for.Before I forget, one thing that makes these connectors so great. Once you disconnect the water stops! No dripping and when you connect the &#34;hot&#34; hose...you will not get drenched......If I was unclear pls ask, I will answer if I can
B00004SDY5 These use universal metric/US hose connector sizes that should fit either or (I'm using them on US sized threads). I bought two sets of these to go on various hoses, pressure washer, sprayers, sprinklers, virtually every watering device and hose I have has these connected on it. It makes it incredibly simple to switch devices on the hose without having to shut off the water. For the past 6 months I have heavily used all of them and none have leaked at the quick connector or the screw fittings! You can pick up a set of o-ring from harbor freight or buy the proper ones from Gardena to replace the quick connectors if they fail (haven't had any issues yet). You can also try to oil them to bring them back to life, especially if you've left it out over winter.These seem really durable. I have had these on hoses and sprayers that have dropped on pavement and not broken off. I've had several cheaper hose fittings that either started leaking within the first year or broke apart the first time they touched pavement. I expect these to last many years without needing replacement.Had a slight issue when I ordered one of the packages was missing one of the female quick connect fittings from the box - Amazon quickly replaced though. Otherwise these are quality connectors that I will continue to stick with Gardena from now on.
B00004SDY5 These are easy to use and perform well as expected. Delivery was fast and the contents were unharmed. The price is higher than comparable products but that is the case with all Gardena items. Worth the extra cost.
B00004SDY5 I thought that a plastic quick connect might turn out to be cheesy, but I gave them a try anyway.After only one month at the end of a light duty hose, the male end just snapped in half. The plastic sheared in half at the middle of the fitting with the male end still engaged into the female snap. Yup, it was under normal water pressure but it wasn't like I was using the hose as a tow rope, or pumping benzene through it.I've had both brass and aluminum hose quick connects wear out over the years, but never snap in half like that.Next time I'll listen to that little voice.
B00004SDY5 I was certain this product would leak but I have had it hooked up to water under pressure for  some time now and have not noticed a single drip. I will add more to other quick connect purposes.
B00004SDY5 Hello. My name is Momster and I am a gadget lover. Oh, I am also lazy...I got sick and tired of screwing and unscrewing my garden hoses whenever I wanted to swap from nozzle to sprinkler. Much to my delight, I found these years ago when buying a new sprinkler (a Gardena) and haven't been able to do without these since.I have a two-way connector attached to my spigot with a QC (Quick Connector), one side goes to our auto-timer that runs the sprinkler (told you I was a lazy gadget lover!!), and one to the regular cleaning/tasking hose. On the end of my tasking hose is another QC so I can slap on another sprinkler or nozzle with very little effort. Because I have a QC on the spigot as well, I can easily change hose configuration without breaking my back because I'd have to bend over AND twist around to access that one.NOTE: Because these are made of plastic, they do have a limited life - especially if you leave them out all year long. (Been there, done that.)  The summer sun and winter freeze will cause the pieces to crack sometimes, so be sure to check them before you use them at the start of the season.Part of the fun is figuring out which pieces should go to what. Have fun with that. But honestly, once you get everything figured out, you'll wonder why in the world you struggled so long without them...especially as you get older....it's no fun playing Twister to get at the spigot.
B00004SDY5 I much prefer snap connectors thought they tend to be overpriced.  Gardena is my favorite brand.  I usually remove the autostop valve inside.
B00004SDY5 This is great!  Sure beats screwing and unscrewing hoses & attachments.  One came with the Gardena Sprikler that I odered and I liked it so much that I ordered the Starter Set for all my other attachments.  Now I just plug and unplug.
B00004SQ1N I wanted a patio box to reduce the clutter of watering cans, garden supplies, and other odds and ends that sat on my patio.  This one is perfect!  It's a great size, not too big, is sturdy, and was a breeze to assemble (no tools needed).  Very happy with this purchase.
B00004SQ1N I have 2 of these. One is a year old and I just ordered a 2nd. They work great to keep things dry and make my yard look less cluttered with stuff.
B00004SQ1N I put this together in about 5 minutes and it's sitting on my back porch right now.  It's strong enough for a 200lb person to sit on comfortably and it's roomy enough inside for all my pool equipment, pool toys, and other miscellaneous things that were sitting around making a mess.  The porch looks great now without all of the clutter!  I'm thinking of buying a second one since I liked this one so much.
B00004SQ1N The size of this item as described is the very maximum outside dimensions.  Anything you want to put inside it will need to fit the interior of a box about 2 inches less on width, length and height.  Not saying the info is deceptive, just not as clear as it might be!  I have a small air compressor that I thought would fit inside it because it is a bit less than the 21 inch height from the description but the inside of the box is a little under 18&#34;.  I was able to make it work by leaving out the bottom tray and trimming away some of the reinforcing ribs in the lid...which reduces the strength making it unsuitable for sitting on but I didn't plan to sit on it anyway.
B00004SQ1N I ordered 2 of these, we really like them.  They are well made and I think they will last a long time outside holding our misc. items (water hoses; electric cords; pool vacuum; etc.).  I don't think they are strong enough to use as a seat, but, we don't need them for that.
B00004SQ1N I am very happy with this deck box. It is very roomy. I keep all my garden supplies there. It was very easy to install, just 5 min, snap all the parts and it is ready to use. It is sturdy too. We sit on it and it holds me, my husband and my 3 years old with no problems. I actually store there some vegetables and fruits, like potato and apples, when I do not have room in refrigerator and I know that animals won't get it. It nicely blends with my white walls of the house.
B00004SQ1X Here in Houston I go through one of these reels every 3 years give or take a bit. What happens is the central support for the wheel simply snaps and the reel then hangs at an odd angle. Soon, it will just fall off. At least it gives a bit of warning.Examining the carcasses of my dead reels I've learned that the plastic bleaches in the sun and the heat and then becomes brittle. It just crumbles. If the reel is full of hose, that extra weight doesn't help much either.I'm going to try knocking back to just 50 feet of hose instead of the full reel of hose. My experienced guess is that will work  better. Also I'll spray some UV protectant on the hub before I mount the reel. That may help.So why do I keep buying these if they don't last too long? Well, for one I've got my holes drilled in the brick and I really like just being able to slap the new unit in place of the old one without drilling even more holes for some new reel which may or may not last any longer than this one. Also, I don't see where anybody makes a side winding reel that is that much better than this one for the price at this time.
B00004SQ1X This is the second of theses reels I have purchased.  The first one broke after much use due to the stress and a heavy hose I had installed.  This time I purchased a much lighter weight hose and it works great.
B00004SQ1X I bought a STA100 at True Value Hardware this morning. It ran $23.99 + tax = $25.50. (With a store buyers card). It's slightly different than the one I replaced, requiring me to drill 3 new holes. Not an issue with me. Like other reviews I've read, the round parts that are on either side of the wrapped hose were also warped. That means it came from the factory/shipper that way. There was no damage to the shipping box. Perhaps the heat from the sun will help straighten that out. I also read their 5 year warranty, which I doubt I would ever use. The defective one needs to be shipped back to the company at owners expense, they will fix or replace it, then you must pay for return shipping. That is NOT a good or reasonable warranty. Still, I'm satified with my purchase. UPDATE: IT DIDN'T EVEN LAST ONE YEAR. WHILE I LIVE IN ARIZONA WHERE IT'S HOT, THE PLASTIC DRIED OUT AND FRONT PART WITH THE HOSE FELL OFF AFTER BREAKING. IT'S NOW USELESS AND IN THE TRASH. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. OR AT LEAST DO NOT BUY ONE THAT MOUNTS ON A WALL. CHANGE MY RATING TO A 1 OR 2.
B00004SQ1X The fatal flaw with the design of this hose reel is that it can not support the weight of a 100' hose full of water. The first problem was that the wheel part wanted to separate from the spindle due to the weight of hose.  Finally the part you screw to the wall gave way and broke in half after about a year.  This is a waste of money - anything plastic is essentially junk.  I have now replaced it with a full metal version from another maker that was about three times the price.  It looks like it will work forever.  Also, this reel BARELY is able to hold 100ft of 5/8\" hose.  It is probably more suited for 50 or 75ft.  If I had it to do all over again, I would have purchased a quality reel the first time.
B00004SQ1X I've had this for four years.  It leaked from day one.  Finally took it down to see if I could fix it.  The replacement part from Suncast costs 64 cents but the shipping is $9.50. On a 4 year old item, replacing the part doesn't make sense. Since this hose is right next to my front door, I have to have some sort of reel.  I'll look elsewhere.
B00004SZ9D This stovetop smoker is amazing.  We currently own theChar Broil Silver Smokerand it take 5+ hours to smoke fish and meats.  The stovetop smoker can achieve the same results in about 30-40 minutes.  I love using different varietities of the smoking chips and foods come out tender, juicy and full of flavor.  Clean up is simple since I use foil to line the bottom of the drip pan.  All I have to do is toss out the smoking chips ashes, peel back the aluminum foil, give it a quick wash and rinse to get any moisture or any food splatter on the lid  and store it until the next use.  This unit does not fill your house with smoke but you can smell the wonderful aroma of cedar, apple, mesquite or whatever flavor of chips you use.Since I have a smooth top stove and do not want to scratch the surface, I use the stovetop smoker on top ofSanyo HPS-SG3 200-Square-Inch Electric Indoor Barbeque Grill, Blackand also use it on with myWeber 586002 Q 320 Portable Outdoor Gas Grill.  Using it on the Weber Grill gets slower cooking results but it is great to take to picnics and camping to smoke up those fish you catch!
B00004SZ9D This stove top smoker is one of the best products I have ever used (and I use it often).  I have had this thing for about 5 or 6 years now.  It is as good as the day I bought it.  I smoke chicken and ribs mainly but you can smoke just about anything that you could in a regular smoker (just not as much in terms of amount).  It is easy to clean and the wood chips are reasonable in price.  You only use about a teaspoon to a tablespoon depending on what you are smoking.  I would highly recommend this product.  The best wood to use is hickory (it is the all around best for all types of meats).  The next best as far as i have found is the Cherry.  It imparts a nice fruity taste to meat.  If anything happens to this smoker, I will certainly buy another one.  This product is one that lasts and lasts!
B00004SZ9D I have not used this product yet, but it is very heavy and lots of wood chips came with it. I am looking forward to having the time to fool with it.
B00004SZ9D I have NEVER used this product after purchasing two or three years ago.  Other reviewers seemed to like it so I gave it five stars.  I have packed it away somewhere and will give it away to anyone who wants it.
B00004SZ9D pick a flavor of smoke, get some of Cameron's wood dust in that flavor and get ready to smoke stovetop style, any season.  just great flavor.
B00004SZ9D I lived in a condo for years and really missed cooking outdoors and the tremendous flavor of food slow smoked in a smoker.  I bought this awhile ago and have been pretty happy with it.  It's stainless steel, durable and comes with samples of 4 different types of wood chips. You can buy more from Cameron international or Amazon.com. I use it all the time and never have any problems with smoke filling up the kitchen and the smoke detector never goes off. It's a closed unit so virtually all of the smoke stays inside.  If there is a problem with smoke escaping, the instructions include tips on how to correct the problem.  Usually, the lid just needs a little tweaking.I think the first thing I smoked in it was salmon and let me tell you it was delicious! I have also smoked chicken, turkey wings, sweet potatoes, potatoes, shrimp, burgers, and cheese all with excellent results.  I put the potatoes in the microwave for a few minutes to shorten the cooking time. The chicken doesn't brown as in a traditional outdoor smoker or grill but you can finish cooking it in the oven to brown it.  If it's smoke flavor you are after, this is a very good alternative to outdoor smoking!Cleaning the smoker is a breeze if you first spray the rack with cooking spray.  Also if you line the base of the smoker and the drip pan with aluminum foil all you have to do is let it cool completely and dump the foil in the trash.  This will help to keep your pans from getting black and shortens clean up time.
B00004SZ9D I just tried my stovetop smoker and was amazed at the results.  I've used a large outdoor smoker for years, and was skeptical about the stovetop smoker.  I used it to prepare chicken breasts, and they cooked fast and were juicy and tender, and had just the right amount of smoke flavor.  I'm looking forward to using my stovetop smoker for seafood and vegetables.  It's a great way to add flavor to food, and a very healthy way to cook.The smoker is constructed from heavy steel and is well made.  I could smell the smoke as the food cooked, but it wasn't intense and there was no smoke in the house.  I'll still use my outdoor smoker for batch cooking or for smoking large birds, but expect to get a lot of use out of the stovetop smoker.
B00004SZ9D Used once and really like it. I smoked whole chicken, but I cut chicken in half and smoked about 1.5 hours on lower heat. The chips birned, so next time I would add more chips. I did have to finish chicket (to add some crispiness) in the oven for 10 min. The chicken came out excellent, best chicken I ever cooked. With chicken smoked potato and came out very nice as well with delicate flavor of smoke. Also, I considered as a bonus the aroma of smoked wood that fill out my house, loved it. It was not strong, but flavorful. Highly recommend this product.
B00004TBJ7 I've had this grill for about two months now and I love it. It's nice to see that Char-broil has taken the initiative to break free from the standard black, rectilinear grill. This grill tucks neatly into the corner of my back deck and looks great. Friends are always commenting on it.As for cooking, the smaller grill surface has proven to be ample for parties of four when cooking fish, steaks or skewered items. For sandwich-style grilling (e.g., hamburgers, hotdogs, etc.) you can cook for twice that many. The cooking surface itself is a refreshing change as well; the metal slats are thick and give restaurant-style grill marks to your food, while providing more surface area for smaller items to sit on. The Patio Caddie comes with hickory-scented briquettes that enhance the flavor and mask the gas scent.Be sure to consider the Patio Caddie if you're in the market for a high quality gas grill in this price range. You can't go wrong!
B00004TBJ7 I've owned the Char-Broil Patio Caddie for quite a few years and I am currently on my 2nd grill.  For those looking for a compact grill to use on a small patio or balcony, I believe that this is the best grill that you'll find.I'm not sure if the other reviews mention this or not, but this grill does accept a full-size propane cannister, so you can just swap it out at your local drug or hardware store when it's empty.  My grill did come with the smaller cannister, but I bought it quite awhile ago, so perhaps they no longer do.  If yours doesn't, it's no great loss, in my view, because once again, I've never used the smaller cannister.  Just get yourself a full-sized one and it will last a lot longer.The temperature gauge seems very accurate and the grill is quite durable. I figure that this grill should last you about 5-6 years, with regular use.  I'd definitely recommend it and I'd also suggest buying the cover to keep it looking nice on the outside as well.
B00004TBJ7 This is a perfect grill for small groups.  I typically only grill for my wife and I so the size is perfect.  It wasn't too difficult to assemble and the parts machining is excellent, everything fit together very well.  I have only 2 problems with this grill.  First, the hangers you attach to the lid to allow you to hang the lid from the side of the grill are quite a pain when placing the lid.  Makes it difficult for the lid to fit snugly.  Not a problem, I'll just take the hangers off as they don't work that well anyway.  Second, I grilled on it 2 days ago, on a fairly calm day weather wise.  For some reason the flame kept going out.  Took me an hour to grill 4 steaks, should have only taken 20 minutes.  Not sure what causes this problem as I haven't ready anyone else experiencing it.  It's annoying enough that it keeps the grill from getting 5 stars.
B00004TBJ7 I bought this a replacement for one exactly like it.  The old one finally was put to rest after many years of use by my parents.  This compact grill is easy to use and uses up very little space.  Perfect for a small deck.  Great construction and easy set up.  The one drawback was that the new grill did not come with the two side tables that the original grill had. I took them off the old grill and installed them on the new one.
B00004TBJ7 I love this grill, it is deceptively small from the outside. You can probably fit 8-10 burgers on it. It takes up a third of the space as my old \"Grill 2 Go\" portable grill. It has an attractive dark green finish. As others have said, it heats evenly unlike most grills which focus the heat along the burner.The only reason I'm giving it three starts is because Amazon (and the Char Broil) site lists it as having a propane tank included. From reading the Amazon description and some other reviewers comments, it should've come with a smaller propane tank. According to the Char Broil site there should be a 20 pound tank. I sent Amazon an email followed by a phone call, and they stated that there should've been a tank, so they immediately sent me a new grill, had it the next day, great customer service! But this one, like the first box said on the outside \"LP tank not included.\" I called Amazon now, and the rep agreed that there should be a tank, and sending a third unit would be pointless as it would probably not have a tank. Amazon offered me a $30 refund to cover the cost of a 20 pound tank purchased locally, which was an acceptable resolution.
B00004TBKI This would have been a zero star review if I could have done that.  Yellowjackets would fly around it but would not enter.  After three weeks I tried to return and Amazon didn't even want the POS returned, just gave me a credit.  I guess not having to return it is worth one star.
B00004TBKI Don't waste your time or money on this peace of pretty plastic.  Using the bait that came with it and the bait refills I bought extra, it never trapped one yellow jacket in an area well populated with the little pests.  Save your money and get a good fly swatter and some spray for the nests.
B00004TBKI With the included attractant I caught one yellowjacket.  They preferred to go to the hummingbird feeder and when I took the feeder down they flew away.  Using apple juice I caught some even with the feeder up and more when I took the feeder down.  They live for several days and most of them eventually escaped at night.  Next year I will put this in the refrigerator each night to chill the yellowjackets, kill them while they are torpid, and then put it back up.  Apple juice worked in the fall but something else might be required in the spring.
B00004TBKI By far, the most effective pest control for Yellowjackets I've ever come across.  How effective you ask?  We had a major Yellowjacket problem and I went to 4 stores...all of which were out of this trap.  At each store, there was at least 1 person (one place had 3) looking around for the traps because of the yellowjacket problems in this area.  Finally the 5th place I stopped had just restocked and their shelves were full...and yes, there were 2 people already picking them up when I arrived.Come home, put the solution on the cotton ball and by the end of the first 12 hours, we had caught 13 yellowjackets.  I come home tonight from work and we are now up to 25 yellowjackets this device has captured in under 24 hours!Now those are measurable results!EDIT:I just added a photo...over 40 yellow jackets trapped in just 3 days!
B00004TBKI Great and effective product for YJ's only. No food attracts hornets and really foul smelly stuff attracts flies, but this is great for YJ's. Other wasps and hornets are attracted to the activity but they like fresh meat/bugs. Fly catchers (stinky bags) attract hornets and wasps to the live bugs. I have used these for many years. Use these units with the larger 10 week cartridge, and place the small pack bait (available at Amazon) on it when it gets weak, reuse with this type of cheaper bait in the larger cartridge each year, but check that there are no webs covering the bottom holes and/or internal cone hole, or YJ's will leave. It works very well to catch queens looking to build nests in April, and keep them out until Sept. to get workers of queens that were missed. Very effective. Move to another location if no luck in 2 weeks, or if very few are caught. Load indoors or after sunset, or you might get stung. Hint, this old fish smell works well in the spring, sweet attractant works better before hybernation in the fall in a different type of catcher; one you can put juice, beer, or other sweet attractant, with a drop of soap, recharge with water but add a drop of non-fragrant dish soap as it evaporates.
B00004TBKI Does not seem to actually capture YJ's, but their annoying buzzing stopped when I put one of these about 20' outside of my veggie garden. Somehow it seems to work. YJ's, hornets, were making nests in the GROUND, in dying roots from pine trees which I had cut down YEARS ago...the roots seem to never completely rot, but leave a hollow which apparently invites these guys. And they are protective of their nest area.I use the stuff which comes with the trap, nothing fancy like apple juice and peanut butter.I bought a 2nd one this year for near an apple tree where these guys get their sips from fallen apples or apples which the birds have started to pick on. Hope it works there too.Recommend.
B00004TBKI Never enough around, re-ordered product; easy to use though this current model is missing the hanging string.  Works well for 30-45 days until the scent diminishes.  It is an effective product.
B00004TBKI We had hundreds of wasps in our tree so I ordered one of these, followed the instructions and waited for the massacre.  NOT ONE DEAD WASP after 3 weeks of use.  I changed bait for 3 more weeks, nothing. I changed bait again and still nothing after another month.  I half expected the wasps to build a nest around it. Bah, annoying.
B00004TBKK Washed out my 'old' trap that I have been using for several years, placed a 'new' cartridge in the trap and had begun capturing wasps or yellow jackets by the next morning. Keeps my backyard free of the pests...
B00004TBKK Very effective, I am able to keep my garden and yard relatively yellow jacket free and I can enjoy sting free outdoors.
B00004TBKK I have a time to time yellow jacket problem where I live so I bought a yellow jacket trap and this bate to help with the problem.  I followed the instructions and hung it in an area well populated with yellow jackets.  I left it there for weeks and it never trapped one yellow jacket.  Yesterday I took it down and threw it in the trash.  Waste of money.
B00004TBKK This attractant works excellent for YJ's and I have been using Recue successfully for several years. Easy to place and reusable units and these cartridges can be easily resused by adding liguid from the less expensive plastic refills. However, I believe these cartridges last longer and are a better value. Great price at Amazon. Must be used in the effective Rescue canisters. They really work great!! Highly recommend!Great and effective product for YJ's only. No food attracts hornets and really foul smelly stuff attracts flies, but this is great for YJ's. Other wasps and hornets are attracted to the activity but they like fresh meat/bugs. Fly catchers (stinky bags) attract hornets and wasps to the live bugs. I have used these for many years. Use these units with the larger 10 week cartridge, and place the small pack bait (available at Amazon) on it when it gets weak, reuse with this type of cheaper bait in the larger cartridge each year, but check that there are no webs covering the bottom holes and/or internal cone hole, or YJ's will leave. It works very well to catch queens looking to build nests in April, and keep them out until Sept. to get workers of queens that were missed. Very effective. Move to another location if no luck in 2 weeks, or if very few are caught. Load indoors or after sunset, or you might get stung. Hint, this old fish smell works well in the spring, sweet attractant works better before hybernation in the fall in a different type of catcher; one you can put juice, beer, or other sweet attractant, with a drop of soap, recharge with water but add a drop of non-fragrant dish soap as it evaporates.
B00004TBKK I put up 2 of these. One was about 20' from an apple tree which the yj's just love. Had no problem until the end of the season, I'm guessing that that's when the 10 weeks supply ran out. I put a 2nd near my veg garden and about 15' form old tree roots which the yj's also find irresistible. No problem there either this year.Would buy again.
B00004TBKL I've had this up for a week and it's got one yellow jacket. I notice that some people recommend apple juice, but the instructions say to just add water.I'm very disappointed.I added some sugar today and possibly other ingredients in the future to make this more attractive.Their fly catcher is great, but this one works poorly for St. Louis yellow jackets.
B00004TBKL I know the difference between yellow jackets, honey bees, bumble bees, paper wasps, and bald faced hornets.  It was yellow jackets that were harassing my hummingbirds at the feeder. With the originally supplied attractant I caught no yellow jackets in this trap.  With Dr. Pepper I caught one in a week.  Another bait might have worked better but the Rescue reusable trap with apple juice worked somewhat so I stopped using the one-time use trap.
B00004TBKL Changed from 1 to 3 stars. 'Worthless' was initially noted, as the YJ's often walked in and just walked back out. It will trap some initially, but later catches flys AND hornets. The bags often have defects. This 'type' of bag device is great for flies (get the 'Big Bag' fly type as it stinks more like a ripe out-house and holds lots) but this (YJ type) smells like rotten fish (better to smell bad and catch things that sting you). Get the 'Big Bag Fly Trap' type like this for flies but use Rescue yellow plastic traps for YJ's. (W.H.Y traps are worthless so read the reviews). These will trap some flys and YJ's and a few Hornets going in for live food. Hornets will not fit in the hard yellow Rescue YJ traps, but hornets do fit in these, and do go in after flys and YJ's.Hornets are very unique and there seems to be no attractant for hornets, except people, and other live insects. Stick with Rescue (hard yellow-domed plastic type) for YJ's. This type, made for flies, work 'great' for flies. Hornets seem to hang out at the bag-type fly and yellowjacket traps to capture live insects. Sometimes these traps and the fly traps capture hornets (that is why I switched from 1 to 3 stars) that go in looking for live flys or maggots but it is not real common. I find one hornet hangs out at he top of the trap at a time, and when there is a hornet there the other bugs disappear. When it is gone the other critters reappear. These traps smell like rotten fish, which is fine, and the fly traps smell like outhouses, which is really strong if the wind is wrong. Hard to eat near the fly traps. I have trapped several hornets that go in due to the activity in the bags.Hint: If you add a very little non foaming, non smelling, dish soap to any water-type trap the insects drown quickly instead of crawl out, dehydrate, wear-out, or over-heat. These critters (YJ's and hornets) only know to sting and are constantly hunting for food for their hive, to feed the larvae (more future scavangers). They sting live bugs and bury them in with the growing insect to feed on while they are in suspended animation = creepy).Update 8-7-13:I still think these are not as good as the reusable Rescue hard trap (for yellow jackets) which you can re-bait:Pros:-They do catch flys and some YJ's.-They do trap some hungry Hornets looking for live critters.-It is an attractant for flys, YJ's and Hornets (rotten fish smell and activity)-It comes with attractant; just add water and a lead to hang it with.Cons:-They are firm plastic bags, flexes but not soft like a baggie-type, and some have arrived with holes (punctures) in them, which I used duct (Gorilla) tape on to cover then fill. This can lead to a stinky mess if you fill any in the kitchen. I do not know a way around this type of bag and think 'it is the best they can do' for a bag.-Holes develop on the seams after a while. Maybe from the weight of the water.-You have to keep replenishing the liquid that evaporates (I use a little wine/apple juice/sugar-water with a dab of non-fragrant, non foaming dish soap; do not use hot water).-They are one-use and throw away (before tossing I recommend draining the fluid outdoors, away from the house, letting the bag dry out, then throw away in the trash - stinky mess with maggots from flys). I do not recommend just putting a smelly liquid-maggot-filled bag in your trash.-Many yellow jackets tend to walk-in and walk-out, as do hornets and flys.-Stationed at most bags there is a sentry Hornet that posts itself at the entrance and it keeps all YJ's and flys away. Hornets prefer live catch. Other flying insects seem to be afraid of them, and I have seen some Hornets try to sting a bug (from the outside of the bag) that is inside the bag, and they try to catch any that fly around. This problem tends to keep many flys and YJ's away from this type of trap.-I have seen Hornets stationed at the 'fly traps', too, but I have trapped many flys in them so they get 5 stars. I have seen Hornets go in and sting maggots but have not witnessed them flying out with them, not that they don't.-these do not come with a hanging device (so be sure you have one on before you fill it).-you must carefully cut the bag with scissors around the opening to pull out the entrance device before filling and hanging.
B00004TBKL Last year was a horrible YJ year here in Northwest Montana.  Although I caught hundreds daily in July with homemade traps (mason jar with soapy water and meat dangling over it) - this year I set the non disposable Rescue traps out in mid-April after 2 YJ in the house.  I was prepared to try to catch queens early and hopefully have a better summer - typically bugs of any kind are not an issue here.When I bought the non disposable, I  also bought these and these are not only lots more convenient but I've been getting 50-75 in each in several days vs 15-20 in the non disposable.  Our weather typically is a string of warm, sunny days followed by cool & cloudy so at the onset of warm and sunny, I set out fresh traps.I have 8 acres of wooded property but am setting traps only in my yard area - maybe slightly less than 1 acre.  I didn't expect to catch so many this early.  I hope it helps.Now - in my area, they seem to do best in the sun.  It is nearly 80 today but most warm days have been 65-70.  I have 2 or 3  of a mix of disposable and non-disposable hung in 5 places from 20-40 feet away from my house.I'm using water in the traps, not apple juice.FWIW, I did try adding some of my mason jar meat traps and there was no interest in those at this point.  Also, previous years, I've caught wasps and hornets in beer.  Beer did not work last year or this for the YJs.  I also tried Hawaiian Punch last year - no, they liked my chicken leg bones with a bit of bbq sauce.  Crazy.  But, these are working for me this year, I am just astonished at the volume considering we had 3 periods of sustained below zero temps over the winter.
B00004TBKL I'm allergic to the buzzy creatures and have to carry an epi-pen.  Lots of them favor the nooks and crannies of our 120 year old log cabin up in the Rockies. I've tried everything they sell and we try to avoid chemical poisons.  This really works and works fast.  Use as directed and start early spring to head off those &#34;queens&#34;  We have cut back the problems by 75% since we began to use it a couple of years ago
B00004TBKL I hung this trap about 20 feet from an underground yellow jacket nest.  For the first few days, not many yellow jackets were trapped, I was not impressed.  I went out and shook it up a bit, making sure that the attractant was properly dissolved in the water.  Next time I checked, this thing was FULL of stinging insects, yellow jackets and a few hornets.  There are still some yellow jackets around my deck, but a lot fewer.  We can now sit out there without fear of being stung.  This first trap was a test drive, I am now ready to purchase more of these things.  Would like to purchase another three, but Amazon only has ONE in stock!  Bummer.  At least I know that they are  not a waste of money.  I do worry about the bee population, but I cannot have them so close to my house.  My kid is being stung, we cannot enjoy our deck.  The bees have to move outta town!
B00004TBKM I am guessing the 'attractant' used in these traps is derived from poop.WORD TO THE SQUEAMISH- this bag will be FULL OF FLIES, and the whole thing will be pulsing from the dying wing-beats of the hundreds (thousands?) of flies inside the bag. It is NOT for the faint of heart.YUCK. It's giving me the shivers just to look at the picture.Flies are gross, a clear bag full of horse poop smell and dying/dead flies is worse!Find a different solution.
B00004TBKM I'm updating my last review where I said it didn't work. I've since moved it to a new location and this trap collect hundreds of flies. I can really see a difference when I got outside now.I would also like to add that I didn't take this down during hurricane sandy and it held up to the really bad rain, and very high wind pretty well! I thought it was gonna be all ripped apart when I went out there to look at it. The winds reached at least 90MPH. So don't worry if you get a bad storm. As long as you have it tied up good it should stay.
B00004TBKM beware -- do NOT have in enclosed spaces....even just walking by it makes me want to gag!!  but the flies love it.  they have such bad taste
B00004TBKM . . .whether they're being attracted for a mile radius.  I didn't think I had a big fly problem.  We had a few flies.  We're in a residential neighborhood in tropical Hawaii, not a horse farm or overly near a public park.  Still, the trap only lasted a week before becoming filled up with what I estimate might be one thousand flies.FWIW, this trap works.  It attracts flies to a smelly liquid trap where they subsequently drown.  During the week I had it up hanging 20 feet from the house in a tree, no flies came into the house.  I'll take a break for a week, then try it again to see if the trap lasts longer and whether the fly population seems to have decreased.FWIW, take two, I developed a macabre fascination with checking on the trap every few hours to see how many more flies had been caught.  Ick.
B00004TBKM We had a fly problem a few years ago, so I tried these traps. I was very impressed with the sheer number of flies it caught (my wife was just disgusted). This year we had a bigger infestation, so I tried theRescue Reuseable Fly Trap with Attractant #FTA-SF4and they were nearly ineffective. I purchased a few more of these disposable traps and they're amazing at attracting and catching flies. The smell, however, is quite bad and is almost more offensive than a few rogue flies.The major advantage of this type of trap is that it works in the daytime, when flies are active, unlike an electronic trap like theFlowtron Model BK-40D Electronic Insect Killer (One Acre Coverage)(which I also purchased).The irony, I found, in having such effective attractants is that you get more flies. I moved my traps to the far side of the yard, away from the house, and suddenly we have fewer flies trying to sneak in the side door. (Obvious?)
B00004TBKM They stink like an old outhouse but work great trapping fly's and hornets; the hornets go in to catch a fly or maggot and can't get out. There is usually a sentry hornet that hangs out at the opening, and tries to get fly's from outside the bag, or, goes in after them. Once that hornet is gone, another arrives. Hornets want live bait.Warning: Do not use indoors!! If you fill it in the kitchen or inside your house, do not spill any in the sink, floor, trash, or your hands, as it really reeks, as it is supposed to to attract fly's, like to an outhouse. Some bags do leak from manufacturing defects. Yuck!! It does not wash off easily. Do not use warm or hot water in the bags as you will dissolve the smelly contents too quickly and not attract fly's to the heat. Once hung, refill it, regularly only to the line (it gives them space to crawl in and get stuck inside), and towards the end of the season add some apple-juice to attract more flys and hornets, and yellow jackets. Adding a drop of dish detergent helps them drown quickly, and to sink to the bottom. If you fill it too full, or the dead fly's stack up, the others will crawl out easily. Keep a space between the yellow plastic and the fly's and water. Once full of fly's just unhook it and set it on the ground to dry out then toss the whole bag; it will stink. Be sure once you have opened it that the yellow top seals in the open position from the weight so fly's do not crawl back out. Be careful not to get stung while refilling if a stinger creature is close; you encroach on their hunting territory.These have worked well for me and I prefer The Big Bag model. Highly recommended!! These can stink up an eating, playing, or relaxing area but gets flies like crazy, and some hornets and YJ's. My wife cannot stand the smell so I get the job.
B00004TBKM I can't fathom a fly catching product working any better. We experienced a few flies in the house this Spring so we purchased this product. In less than one week, this product caught over two hundred flies. What is kind of funny is that this product attracts flies to it...who knew there were that many flies around my house. While the product captures many flies, it also attracts them.  Flies that were not necessarily a problem were captured. Day one a few flies are trapped, and each subsequent day--- by the fifth day, the amount of flies caught was unimaginable. I am going to rid the entire neighborhood of flies at this rate. I am going to stockpile this product.
B00004TBKM This fly trap catches a lot of flies and so far we can't smell anything from it.  It is hanging outside suspended on a string tied to our garage.  Perhaps its because of our trade wind weather...but so far no smell and it has been hanging out for a week.  It's actually fun to see all those trap flies inside.
B00004TBKM I've been using this brand of fly trap for about 5  years now and it's never disappointed me. It will catch all the nasty types of flies you normally find during the summer time. This is perfect for pet owners like myself, in case the dog dumps its love bundles and I don't see it, which can atrack flies.A couple of things you should know about this product:First, it will probably not catch any flies the first day, and let me explain why, the material in the trap and water that you add need to mix for about a day, at which type, a very strong smell will start to come out of the trap, which means it is now working. After the first day, and during the hot ones, trust me, it will be gross, yet amazing thing what this trap can do.Second, you have to constantly add water to the level indicated on the bag, specially during the hot days and if the trap is under direct sun light. This is easy to do with a paper cup or any other small cup.Third, when hanging it, place it away from your doors and windows, or be ready for some nasty smells. The trap has a mixture of eggs(dried) and other products to create a strong odor that flies can't resist.In conclusion, this product DOES NOT USE chemicals at all, it is all natural and catches a great number of fly species; it won't let you down. It works.
B00004TBKM I have a four year German Shepherd and during the summer months the flies tend to munch on the tips of his ears. I have tries all types of all natural insect repellents, none of which ever worked. I also tried flys off which was fair but not 100%, not even 50% effective. So I decided to eliminate the flies to eliminate the problem. I then searched Amazon, my go to company for everything and I discovered the fly trap. I was skeptical at first but I opened the top and filled with water ad directed and hung it near my dogs house. Within hours I saw many flies trapped and within a few days the number of flies in the area has decreased tremendously. I will buy more fly traps and if you have a problem with flys, you should too.
B00004TBKM These things work great!  Make sure you follow the directions to open/set it up, then fill it with water and hang someplace out of the way where the flies collect.  I've hung ours about 50 feet from our patio, under a pine tree where we have a quail block feeding the birds.  Lots of flies gather round there, and these traps fill up quickly.  Nary a fly makes it to our patio, even when we have our meals out there.  Before the fly trap, we were constantly swatting and shooing flies while sitting on the patio.  So glad I found these!  Only downfall, they are a little stinky, I can smell it when I walk by about 8 feet away, but since it's not close to our 'living space', it's no problem.
B00004TBKM The only thing wrong with my order is that I did not order more! The trap was working within 30 minutes of setting it up.I want to thank the reviewer who said he had an issue with cutting the plastic at the top of the trap. Had I not read his review I would have had the same issue. I avoided it by using an exacto type cutting tool to cut the circle out.When setting it up I did spill some of the attractant on the side of the trap. The flies were all over it within 15 minutes and 30 minutes later they were in the trap. Be sure to hang this trap up of the reach of pets. This trap not only attracts flies it also attracts dogs too. Never underestimate the intelligence and leaping ability of a miniature dachshund. She immediately found where I had spilled it on the ground and soon figured out the source. I distracted her, hung it higher, and washed away what spilled on the ground. I mention this only because we mini dachshund owners tend to be very protective of our little heart stealing dogs.A possible mistake I made when setting this out was to hang it in direct sunlight. We have a heat wave at this time and during the hottest part of the day I did not see any flies around the unit. Today I am going to hang it in a shade tree. I'm sure that will work and if it does not I will update this review within a short period of time.I feel that this trap is well worth what I paid for it and as soon as I am done with this review I am going to order at least one more maybe two. One for the front yard and one for the back. I have a fly problem because I have fruit trees, compost piles, a garden, and I live in a tiny town surrounded by farms. The flies in the front yard are a bad problem because when I mow the yard they come out and pester me when I am trying to concentrate on safely mowing the part of my yard where it has steep slopes. You can easily turn your mower over while trying to swat a biting fly. If the yard does not get mowed I wind up with thousands of mosquitoes and dozens of snakes.All in all I am happy with this purchase and I wish I had found this item many years sooner.UPDATE. JULY 28,2011.I'm glad I ordered more. My trap is already full. One more thing I need to mention. Don't hang the bag too close to where you sit or eat outside. The bag has an odor and without that odor the trap will not work. I would experiment by hanging it in different locations. The perfect spot would be close enough to attract flies away from you but far enough that you don't smell it. It also helps to remove things that attract flies away from the trap. Mine hangs in a fruit tree. I had some rotten fruit on the ground that was attracting the flies more than the trap. I raked them up and got rid of them. The next day the flies were swarming the trap even more than they had been.
B00004TBKM I put these by the chicken coop, the edge of the property that is past our pool, and another past the fenceline that is closest to our deck.  Draws flies like crazy.  Can't have close to the house because it's pretty stinky!  All you do is add some water and hang the bag out..let it get full and toss it.
B00004TBKM This is a great product but I think the price is a mistake (94.00) I got mine at some local store for less than 10 bucks.  I just put one up a few days ago and it is filled (I have chickens) with flies.  Really works well I keep one by the coop and another by the house. I am going to get more it is really too full. The best part you just chuck it when you're done with it.
B00004TBMV I am an ISA Certified Arborist, so I can tell you, as a professional, that this product beats all other similar products out there, hands down.  I use mine on the job just about everyday, and it stands up to pretty tough use.  It does go through webbing straps every now and then, but restringing new straps is easy, once you get used to it.  Customer Support at Fiskars is second to none.  They have replaced, at no charge, numerous webbing straps, the extension tube and a cutting head.  Rest assured, unless you are a professional out there, you will probably never have to change out anything on your unit.  If you ever have to though, I can assure you that Fiskars will be there to help you out, via their toll-free number and quick e-mail response team.  I recommend this unit and its smaller brother.  Both go into the trees with me, sixty feet and higher, and both give reliable service.
B00004TBMV I'm pleased with this. I'm 66 years old and a cancer survivor so don't have the saying power of some people.  Have found this very easy to use.  It is a little heavy for me when fully extended but not so bad I can't use it.  One thing I learned is to adjust the head so I make square cuts to avoid any hang up from the branch starting to fall and binding the blades.  Used this to trim limbs over my electric pasture fence while driving my tractor so my Tractor ROPS bar now clears the limbs. If the jaws fit around a limb you can cut it without a terrible amount of strength.  I bought this to trim some tall hedge bushes along the edge of my yard and it worked well for trimming the tall tops.  Have used the saw (3 inch limbs) and it cuts fine if you let it do the cutting and take your time.  Used it to cut some woody stemed large weeds on hard to navigate banks too. Over all a very handy tool.
B00004TBMV In the $80 range with no shipping or tax, this is worth the money if you need to prune tree branches on a regular basis as I do.  My husband loves it and thinks the construction is superior.  Unfortunately, I have difficulty working it.  He's 65, and I'm 59 and don't have the arm strength/length nor the the height (5' 3\" and under are going to have trouble) to work it properly when it needs to be fully extended. Any man should have no difficulty, and it will pay for itself the first time you use it versus hiring someone to prune for you.August 30, 2007 update:  Since December 2006 when I bought this, I have been forced to use this more because my husband has been unavailable due to his golfing addiction.  In spite of my shortness, this tool works fine for me as long as the trunk of what you are cutting isn't more than one and one-half inch in diameter.  However, there is a saw attachment which will allow you to get through the thicker branches.  Over time, this tool has become indispensable to me, especially since I have six redwood trees, numerous other treees, and tons of high bushes.August 16, 2011:  Fiskars has terrific customer service.  After almost five years of heavy use, a plastic clamp that holds the extension, broke.  Know that Fiskars honors a limited lifetime warranty on this item.  I had to send them a copy of my Amazon receipt and a picture of the damage (picture cannot exceed 2 megabytes). Full instructions on how to make a warranty claim are included on Fiskars' website, plus their telephone customer service is excellent.  They sent me a new part plus a link to complete instructions, including pictures, for disassembling the pruner and replacing the part.  My husband was able to effect the repair.  There was no dollar cost to me at all, and this is way better than having to buy another one for $80.May 28, 2014:  I still use this pruner regularly, and it continues to work well after the repair.  The only problem is that you do have to watch the thickness of the branches you are cutting because this pruner will only tolerate so much.
B00004TBMV Purchased this item at 11 AM.  Used free supersaver shipping. Received the next day. Unreal.  Apparently these are stocked in local warehouses. I live in a small Ohio city. The tracking number immediately showed a UPS exception. This was a first. The product itself is nice. Well made.  Easy to use.  Some commented on the shipping carton.  It was a long box, with 2 separate box pieces taped together.  The UPS man told me it looked like it may be damaged.  It was fine.  I do agree that there should be a box long enough for the item to fit in.  The pole is solid enough that there was very little chance of damage. The box is so odd shaped that nothing else will be piled on top. This will be a useful product. Added:  Minor dissapointment.  Just saw this in my big box grocery store for $ 69.00-full price. This is a full price store-not a discounter.
B00004TBMV excellent product, already done with winterizing trimming around the house, when I first pulled the cutting bowel and branch fell down, my wife instantly said \" magic\", that's how I felt, too. But then moving on to larger branch and switching to cutting saw and that's when problems occured, first the wing nut which were used to tighten and positioned the saw were being knocked off by the tree because of the push and pull motion; which un-screw the wing nut, went down and look for it, after finding it and tightening it up super tight, back to work and the extension poll fell out also caused by the push and pull motion, pick it up, slided it back in, tightening it up and figured out how the rope and jaw reacts to each other and did some adjustments, and it works fine ever since, I'd give it a 5 star if not because it took me 30 minutes to find things and fixed  and adjusted it the first time I've used it, other than that, it's a great helper to make things possible.
B00004TBMV This is a nice, light weight tool for trimming small branches high in trees and shrubs.  It easily cuts branches up to 1/2 inch.  The only reason I did not give it a five star rating is my experience with other Fiskars' tools with the same type of adjustable head. The head is a weak point, after a few months of use my experience is that the plastic head will fail.  Even though it has a lifetime warranty; returning for repairs is just too difficult to be worth the trouble.
B00004TBMV After it arrived, I went right out and trimmed a few trees.  Amazing how easy it was to use and how effective it was.
B00004U9V8 Each time I cook with my grille, I use this around my waist and have all my utensils handy and ready to go, what I did was just hang it upon my belt and it works great, unless you use suspenders or don't wear pants.
B00004U9V8 Each time I cook with my grille, I use this around my waist and have all my utensils handy and ready to go, what I did was just hang it upon my belt and it works great, unless you use suspenders or don't wear pants.
B00004U9V8 I bought this to retrofit it on my Genesis platinum series 2 gas grill.  The reason why is that the factory installed tool hooks prevent you from opening the lower grill doors with tools hanging from the hooks.  These are stainless steel and I have figured out how to do this so I am going to relocate them to the side of the work table on the grill.  They will work and last with a little customization.
B00004U9V8 Clips right onto the rim of the lower kettle half, well-made, really handy, you NEED one of these! Possibly TWO of these!!!
B00004U9V8 This was a nice idea, but it doesn't work to well if you have the lid holder.  Whenever I take the lid out of the holder, the tool holder falls off.  I don't really need it, because I have the perfomer which has a built in tool holder on the table, which I forgot about when I ordered this.  The tool holder should have some kind of locking clamps on it so they will stay in place.  I can see how they would interfere with the lid closing all the way if they are hung off the grill itself and imagine that they don't stay in place when the lid is taken off.  I like having the extra set of tool holders so I think I am going to trying clamping them down on the lid holder with pliers.
B00004U9V8 Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill (One-Touch Silver) and some new Weber tools, I needed something to hold them. I didn't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills, so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder.Now, I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they couldn't get their lid to close, or that the tool holder would fall off. Well, it doesn't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers. This will take care of both problems.I highly recommend this simple-yet-handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One-Touch grill (except for maybe the One-Touch Platinum, since it has everything you need). It is very easy to use, your lid will still close and you grill-cover will still fit =)
B00004U9V8 The tool holder works well.  There is a little leakage of smoke, but I don't think this reduces the quality of food preparation or changes the temperature of the grill.  The tool holder ships from a company other than Amazon, and the shipping/handling costs are more than the holder.
B00004U9VA This charcoal slow-cooker & smoker does everything as advertised.  It is well made and easy to assemble.  I have done 2 cooks so far (baby back ribs, chicken, sirloin tip & salmon).  As long as you don't keep adding smoke-wood, but only do it at the beginning (and do it sparingly) you will have well cooked and flavorful food.  I recommend trying the \"best ribs in the universe\" procedure for your first cook - found at [...]  I highly recommend this cooker and think you will do the same.  P.S. - Amazon.com has about the best prices and delivery you will find around.
B00004U9VA I used this in Vietnam, where the local butcher, Hang Kau Pung, asked me to use my gas grille for his yak. After butchering it, we used the grille to smoke it and had a problem when the ribs did not fit on the Weber 3601 Rib Rack. I had 5 Weber Rib Racks so they were useless and we had to put the cooked meat on the fly dirty ground near treated sewer water. I suppose if you are using pig Ribs they fit but be weary of larger meat animals.

B00004U9VA This Weber is simply the best. Get it going, put in your meat - go to bed and get up the next morning to the best briskets and pork butts you ever had. It is amazing how this charcoal smoker can maintain such constant cooking temps whether it is -20 or + 99 outside.
B00004U9VA I have only owned a couple smokers in my life, and after purchasing this one - I don't plan on owning anything else. The Weber Smokey Mountain Cooker (WSM) is a simple, yet incredibly effective water smoker.The WSM has two cooking sections which allows you to smoke a good amount of food (such as a whole turkey and a whole ham simultaneously). The 18 1/2 inch grates allow plenty of food, but you might have to get a little tricky if you want to smoke something like 8 racks of ribs. This can be done if you roll the ribs up and use a skewer to hold them in place. If you aren't trying to entertain large parties, then this is the perfect family smoker.The WSM is coated with porcelain enamel, much like the One-Touch kettle grills. The grates are triple-nickel-plated. The WSM is very sturdy. The material is nice and hefty, you don't get the sense that this smoker was cheaply made. One of the only issues I have with this smoker is the access door. Instead of being hinged it comes completely off the smoker. It can take a little bit of figiting to get it to attach to the smoker, but this is an extremely small issue.The reason people love this smoker is because with a single batch of charcoal you can smoke for an incredibly long time. If you use the minion method then you can smoke for up to 18-20 hours without adding anymore charcoal! For those who aren't aware, the minion method is where you fill the charcoal ring with unlit charcoal, light about 10-15 briquettes and place them on top of the unlit charcoal. Please don't use the minion method with pre-soaked coals. My first smoke was a brisket and for the first 5 hours it stayed exactly at 245 degrees without any adjustments! I thought my thermometer was broken... it wasn't - this smoker is incredibly efficient. Another example is the second time I smoked with this. I smoked a 10 lb brisket, started at midnight. It finished 5:00 PM the following day. That's 17 hours right there. I roused the coals a bit and was able to smoke some stuffed jalapenos for another 2 hours. That's 19 hours on a single batch of charcoal! I am very impressed. I have a Brinkman smoker and when I used that smoker I would get about 2 hours of burn time. The WSM is just so much more efficient and has MUCH better air control.Here are a couple of tips if you plan on buying a WSM (and you should!).Get a decent enough thermometer, such as a candy thermometer so you can check your temperature at the lid. This will become instrumental in your cooking.Unfortunately the WSM has a small water pan. What you should do is buy a replacement Brinkmann Smoke N Grill charcoal pan (don't get the water pan, make sure you get the charcoal pan). You can buy one directly from Brinkmann for about $13.00. If you look hard enough you can find them online for around $5.00 - $10.00. The Brinkmann charcoal pan fits perfectly inside the WSM as a water pan (some say it fits even better!). It also holds more then double the amount of water then the standard WSM water pan. This allows you about 7-8 hours of cooking before needing to refill the pan, which is much better then the 2-3 you get with the standard water pan. Once your temps stabilize you can easily do overnight cooks and also get some shut-eye!To conclude I would like to say that if you are even thinking about getting a  vertical water smoker then stop looking right now. This smoker is near perfect in every single way. With a few tiny modifications you can own one of the best smokers in the world at this price!
B00004U9VA This thing is ridiculous!  It holds a temperature better than my electric oven.  I can load it up with charcoal, set the vents, and it will be rock steady at 250 degrees for hours.  If you have a favorite BBQ restaraunt that you think is pretty good, try their best menu item and compare it to the \"Q\" you'll produce on this cooker and you'll never eat out again.  I've made baby back ribs, meatloaf, pork butt, spare ribs, and fatties (smoked sausage rolls) and they've all turned out delicious.  Buy it, you won't regret it.
B00004U9VA This is a great product.  It lives up to the Weber name.  The WSM is well built with tight tolerances so heat does not escape.  It is easily possible to get a consistent even burn at 215 degrees for 6 or more hours with a single chimney of charcoal.The two cooking grates allow you to cook a lot of food at a time, and either grate can easily fit several racks of ribs, a 15 pound brisket, or 2 or 3 pork sholders.The water/drip pan holds about a gallon of water and allows for warm moist heat, causing a natural convection and ensuring even heating.It is a breeze to put together and out of the box you will be cooking delicious slow cooked authentic barbeque!
B00004U9VC I used this in Vietnam, where the local butcher, Hang Kau Pung, asked me to use my gas grille for his yak.  After butchering it, we used the grille to smoke it and had a problem when the ribs did not fit on the Weber 3601 Rib Rack.  I had 5 Weber Rib Racks so they were useless and we had to put the cooked meat on the fly dirty ground near treated sewer water.  I suppose if you are using pig Ribs they fit but be weary of larger meat animals.
B00004U9VC The description doesn't do this rib rack justice.  This thing is pretty big and will hold a LOT of chicken.  You will certainly not complain about running out of room!  Even though it might be an exaggeration to think it can hold enough chicken to feed the entire neighborhood, there's enough room here to hold enough chicken for a family of 7 or 8.  Washing it may be a problem.  Just wash it immediately after using it.
B00004U9VC This is a nice item when you want to keep your food off the cast iron grates.  Useful for numerous food items.  Good quality.
B00004U9VC I have been using this rack all summer and still have yet to see it rust as someone mentioned in an earlier review.  The rack is certainly a space saver and comes in handy when you have a lot of grilling do.  I have used it when smoking chicken and ribs in my Weber Kettle, and noticed that the meat may tend to touch when placed in the rack so not all areas may be exposed to the smoke.  If this happens, I may rotate the pieces or just leave it like it is since I'm not entering anything in a competition!  Everything still has the same great taste but the parts that were not exposed to the smoke will have a different color.
B00004U9VC Increase your grill capacity.  Works great.  The only drawback is having to take the ribs out of the rack to baste them.
B00004U9VC I have used this twice now.  Once for baby back ribs (pork loin back) and once for St. Louis style trimmed spare ribs.  It worked great both times, but was easier with the spare ribs than the baby backs.  This was because the spare ribs were straighter (less curve to the rib bones) than the baby backs and stood upright better.  The curve in the baby back ribs made it slightly more difficult to remove a single rack of ribs to rotate it.  But this was a minor issue.  Overall the unit worked great.
B00004U9VV You won't find a better way to start your coals for the Webber Smokey Mountain cooker.  Following directions I had half of the coals I needed nice and white hot for my cooker in about 10 minutes.  It is built better than the ones I have seen at Ace Hardware and other places.  There is an inverted cone grill at the bottom that enables the starter to have more surface area for the newspaper sheets that you use to get the thing started.  You will not be sorry you ordered this along with your WSM cooker!
B00004U9VV Just like everyone else has said, this is a winner.I've owned a few different chimney starters over the years and just never could get them to work reliably.  I always ended up going back to lighter fluid.  Yes, it stinks and it's expensive and it can ruin the taste of your meal if you don't let the charcoal burn down for a long time but it worked every time.  Those Brand X chimney starters didn't always get the charcoal going.The Weber is larger and the design is well thought-out.  Instead of a few holes in the bottom of the charcoal section, it has a grate.  And the grate is kind of reverse-cone shaped so more charcoal comes in contact with the burning newspaper.  The result--it lights pretty much perfectly every time.  All it takes is two broadsheet pages of newpaper stuffed in the bottom.  That's two broadsheets--the equivalent of eight pages of your morning newspaer.  You can also use paper towels--they create less ash.  If you want, you can lightly spray the newpaper or towels with a little Pam or the like.  That's gets the paper to burning quickly.Don't bother with those small, poorly designed, no-name (or even big-name) chimney starters you see around.  The Weber is the one to get.
B00004U9VV 1. It is taller than the cheapos and has more chimney effect so it works better.2. Is made of heavier gauge steel than the cheapos and lasts longer. I just  leave mine outside. It takes years to rust through. My old one lasted about 5-6 years.3. It will rust like any steel exposed to high heat, so the thicker the metal, the longer it will last.4. The length of time to start the coals depends on the brand of coals, their moisture content, humidity and the way you crumple up the newspaper.5. If the coals fail to catch, then repeat the process. Do not pour lighter fluid into it. Doo.6. I just grab the insulated handle and pour the coals out. I do not use the tipping handle thing so I don't need gloves.7. One of the features of a Weber, and some other grills, is that after you finish grilling, you can shut off the vents and save some of the coals for next time. So, pile the newly lit coals over the old ones. This lights them up and gives you a longer fire as well.8. Weber offers little wire fences that allow you to keep the coals off to one side of the grill. Use this feature. Pour your coals into this area, sear your meat quickly and then move it off to the non-coaled area and put the lid on and let it cook slowly to completion. Add specialty wood chips at this time if you wish. This gives the best result.9. Weber stuff seems to be the best, at least in its price range, and they offer a lot of quality accessories that are properly designed.10. Many stores are now just stocking a cheap Chinese brand of chimney. Thin, small, short and just ca ca in general. Don't encourage the b******s, get the real thing._____________________________These are great. The one I reviewed is still good after hundreds of uses.FIRE-STARTING UDATE: sprinkle a little olive oil, or other cooking oil, on the balled-up newspaper. It makes for a hotter and longer-lasting fire that so far has started my charcoal the first time, every time. I also shred the paper and then ball it up. Takes a couple of pages. Don't use the slick paper advertising inserts.
B00004U9VV This takes all the work out of lighting charcoal for the BBQ.  Will help you light and heat up your grill in approximately the same amount of time as a regular gas-grill.  Best part is there is absolutely no need for cancer-causing lighter fluid under any circumstances.  A good gift for the charcoal-phob or charcoal-challenged.
B00004U9VV If you use charcoal you need this! It really works!Just load your bricks throw some paper on the bottom light the paper and in about 5 minutes your bricks are ready for action!
B00004U9VV at least three time a week year around. I've used the Weber chimney starter every time. The 'old' ones were lighter gauge than the current product and they lasted about three years. The latest one is heavier gauge and perhaps it will last longer. I recommend this item.
B00004U9VV I got this because of all the great reviews here on amazon. Some of the reviews said that all you need is 2 sheets of newspaper that was all. and I was like That's not possible. Well it is. this thing is incredible! It starts up quickly and is good to use in about 10-15 min. I have noticed that lower quality bricks do not work as well and that if you over stuff the bottom with paper it will not work right. It smokes a lot! I suggest closing your windows. You really need to have 2 of them when doing large meats such as turkey's and half pigs. That way you can start enough charcoal right off the bat. It also says that you should wait until the coals have a slight white ash on them. I would have to disagree with that because the coals are 30 min from being burned up by then. I wait until the center is red hot and flames are leaping from the top. It seems the coals last longer that way. for 15 bucks it's a no-brainer. Get it!
B00004U9VV This past summer I tried a charcoal grill for the first time and as a result my gas grill was never taken out of the garage.  It's become an obsession of mine and now I have three different grills, one smoker and a collection of different wood chunks.  My newest obsession never would have taken root if there was not an easy, foolproof way of starting the lump or the briquettes.  I don't have any other chimney to compare this to but it works perfectly every time.  Two sheets of newspaper, dump in your fuel of choice and light it.  10-15 minutes later the coals are ready to go.  If you think the newspaper gives too much ash try paper towels sprayed with some cooking oil instead.  If you grill on a deck be careful when you light it or where you put it after dumping out the coals as it gets very hot.
B00004U9VV Dump some charcoal in the chimney, crumple a few sheets of newspaper into the bottom, light the papers, wait a while, and you have ashed, ready to use coals.  This is so much easier and healthier than dousing the charcoal with starter fluid and more convenient than using the electric starters.  If I'd known this sooner, I would've bought my charcoal grill a long time ago!
B00004U9VV Like many other charcoal barbeque enthusiasts, I hate using charcoal lighter fluid.  (Who wants toxic junk smoldering all over their food?)  For years I have used an electric lighter, but ours was on its last legs.  I was tempted to buy a gas grill, as they are fast-lighting, but just really didn't want to spend the money on a product that doesn't perform the way I like.  So, based on the favorable reviews, I decided to try the Weber Chimney Starter.Wow.  Really.I was accustomed to putting the electric lighter under the coals, and preparing other parts of the dinner while the coals were getting started.  And after they had gotten started, it took a while for the fire to really get rolling.I use a Weber barbeque, and every time after I have finished grilling, I close down the vents and save the briquets for another use.  I only have to add a couple of handfuls of new briquets each time I cook.I stuffed the bottom of the Weber chimney starter with newspaper as directed, put in the cold leftover briquets from the last grilling session, and added the usual amount of new briquets.  I lit the newspaper as directed.  At first all it seemed to be doing was producing a copious amount of smoke.  I walked away, and came back just a few minutes later to find the charcoal flaming away most impressively.  The coals were ready in about a quarter of the time that it took using the electric starter.Who needs a gas barbeque for a fast-starting fire?  I had my whole dinner cooked in a half hour from the time that I lit the newspaper.  This charcoal starter is a gem!Update (June 29, 2008):  After using this starter for almost a year (yes, I barbeque in the winter) I have a couple of notes to add.  First, use only the amount of newspaper recommended.  More newspaper cuts down the amount of air able to circulate through the fire, and you just end up with a smoldering mess.  Secondly, don't fill the container full of charcoal.  Doing so extends the time it takes for all the charcoal to ignite, with the end result of making the handle too hot to comfortably hold.  Even if you need a lot of charcoal, only fill the container half-full. Once the briquets are burning, dump them into the barbeque and put more briquets right on top of them if you need more.
B00004U9VV I haven't used lighter fluid in years, ever since getting one of these.I didn't believe that just a couple sheets of newspaper would be enough to get the charcoal going, but that's really all you need.  I use natural charcoal exclusively (you know, real wood, not gravel and clay briquettes), and this works perfectly with that kind of charcoal.You'll reduce the amount of time necessary to get a usable fire, and you won't have that annoying starter fluid smell or taste on your food.Two caveats to consider: this thing gets very hot by its nature, so use oven mitts when grabbing the handle, and be careful where you put it after dumping the coals, so as to keep small children and yourself from touching it until it cools.
B00004U9VV The Weber is the best chimney starter I have used.  It's bigger than most others, can be lifted and dumped with one or two hands, and the handle stays relatively cool.  I just ordered a second so I can fill my relatively large barbeque all at once.  If you are not into gas you need this tool.
B00004U9VV I finally gave up on the lighter fluid and bought this last summer.  What a brilliant idea!  I have always used lighter fluid and was notorious for using to much because the charcoal wouldn't light fast enough.  That problem is solved with this chimney starter.  The coals ignite quickly and a full blaze is going within minutes!  Once the flames have died down, just dump them out and start grilling!I have the Performer grill but when I bought the grill, the store didn't have any cartridges so I have been using the chimney starter all summer.  So it's a nice backup if you have the Performer but no gas cartridge.This is a good product for the price.
B00004U9VV This thing works great! lights my charcoal with ease and without fluid. If you are picky about the taste of your food (you will notice the difference if you grill without lighter fluid or pre-soaked coals) then get this handy starter. It couldn't be easier! shove a couple pieces of newspaper on the bottom, fill it up with coals and light.
B00004U9VV I have another no-name chimney starter that I bought a few years ago for around $15.  I've used it for cooking dutch oven for a couple of years and it has worked fine, or so I thought.  I recently purchased aWeber 2820 Smokey Mountain Cooker/Smokerand bought this Weber Chimney Starter at the same time.  It is MUCH bigger than the generic starter I've been using, and the additional lift assist handle is great.  The conical grate inside the starter allows the charcoal to get up to temperature much quicker than my old unit.  I don't know what I'll use my old starter for now.  From now on, it's only Weber for me.
B00004U9VV As an avid griller and lover of cooking on charcoal, I can't say enough good things about the Weber Chimney starter.This simple to use chimney style starter quickly lights enough lump or briquette charcoal to fill your 22 1/2 inch weber grill WITHOUT LIGHTER FLUID!!Lighting is easy. Simply add charcoal to rim of chimney, place parafin lighters or newspaper in the bottom. Light newspaper or parrafin lighters and place on charcoal grate in grill.  In 20-30 minutes you will have orange hot smokin' charcoal.This is also a must for cooking things with very long cooking times such as turkeys or roasts.  About 30 minutes before adding additional charcoal, use this puppy to light your coals, and then add to the fire as needed.As I mentioned earlier, I reccomend using this in conjunction with the Weber parrafin charcoal lighters.  On windy days they are easier to use than newspaper.Once you use this you will never go back to using lighter fluid again.  A must have for anyone who owns a charcoal grill.
B00004U9VV I've used chimneys for 50 years and this one is the best I've ever had.  It's construction is solid and its handles are positioned to keep ones hands and arms away from the heat.
B00004U9VV A couple years ago my wife complained about how she could taste the lighter fluid in some of the things I grilled. The charcoal just wasn't getting hot enough to burn it all off, especially on cold, rainy days. By the time the ligher fluid was burned-off, the coals were nearly gone, too.We had just seen Alton Brown's Good Eats episode, The Grill Seakers. He had used a chiminy starter to get his charcoal going, so when we saw one in the store, my wife told me to buy it and try it.Well, after two years of use, that cheap starter has gotten to the point where it's ready to fall apart. I needed a new one, and I needed to add something inexpensive to my Amazon.com order to qualify for free shipping, so I ordered this one.I've got to say, even though I read the reviews, I just wasn't expecting something so big! This thing has half-again as much capacity as my old one. It's also a heavier guage metal, and a better handle.One hint: I lightly spray my newspaper with corn oil before putting it in the chiminey. It never burns away too fast, as just two sheets can do if there's enough wind, and I don't find myself packing too much newspaper in. I always get a good fire going, with no lighter fluid taste.
B00004VWM1 boyfriend got this for xmas and he loved it. We haven't used it yet but he looks forward to it!
B00004VWM1 The other reviews are correct. This unit works very well in every way, a basket mesh kind of food holder would be a good option, use a drip pan and keep the coals off to the sides, the ring riser/extension is useful for smoking and cooking big things, etc. It is all good, but there is more:Who do you know who actually has a charcoal grill and a rotisserie? Nobody. If you get one, your guests will be entertained on several levels and you will be the Master. A rotisseries is professional looking, produces unmatched taste and an exciting demonstration-style cooking experience for everyone. Those that utilize them are seen as proficient and competent. Not a bad label for you, eh? Might get you somewhere.The best meal I ever had was a rotisserie turkey that saved me from starvation after a Hike of Death. Perhaps it can save you or a loved one.Rotisserie cooking lends itself to the acclaimed high heat, short cooking time technique. Hot coals and the self-basting action work well here. One of the major gourmet magazines cooked turkeys every way known and strongly recommended the high heat way. This is also the suggested method for cooking heritage meats and wild game.Starting out at 500+ degrees and ending at something short of US government temperature recommendations is the secret. A turkey, for example, is best taken out of the heat at around 170, or less, and allowed to rest. It will go up around 10 degrees after that.I tie bacon strips onto the breast and add wet smoking wood chips to the coals. Stuff the cavity with an orange and some garlic. Other things could be used, too. I have rotisseried heritage, free range, organic, kosher and regular good quality supermart turkeys with this high-heat method and they have all been good.Governments and institutions have to recommend a heat guaranteed to kill off any and everything, and prevent lawsuits of course. However, fresh good quality meat does not have to be nuked to the point where you could make furniture out of it. Use a separate thermometer, not the supplied pop-out sensor. I am no professional, but I can say it produces the best tasting food.___________________________________UPDATE: Years later, it still works. Here are some things that will help you if you get one of these. First, for a turkey, get two oranges and stick them in the cavities. Then, stick the skewer through them. This keeps the turkey from wobbling around so much as the oranges act like bearings. Also, get some meat wrapping string and spend the time it takes to tie the legs, tail and wings up to the skewer so that the turkey is more like a ball without all sorts of dangling things flopping around. Use lots of string. It is cheap. Know that all the energy of the universe will try to circumvent your efforts, so over-do it with the string. Cut it off with scissors before serving.Coat the turkey with olive oil. Don't baste it again.Obviously, don't stuff it!I don't use the bacon anymore. If you use the temperature recommendations, you won't miss the bacon.  It was a pain to tie on and was kind of a waste.The Polder remote thermometer is nice because the probe is thin and doesn't create a big hole.I stop at 160 degrees now. That's just me. Remember, you can cook it more, but you can't remove the overcooking.Learn how to cut the breast meat off. Don't slice it off while it is on the turkey. Instead, cut down right alongside that breastbone. Then cut in from the side, about half-way down the side, straight in. This gives you a big chunk from that one side.  On a plate, cut it in slices, across it, across the grain. So much more professional and better in every way. And it is easier. If you are having trouble visualizing this, you can google up a demo video or illustration.I saw a TV show where it was demonstrated that soaking the chips makes no difference, so I don't anymore. A couple of handfuls gives a nice, not overwhelming little smoke flavor. You may want more, or none.The Weber a fine device and one that surely will make you the rockstar of turkey cooking. Imagine how pathetic your relatives will seem when they take their sad turkeys out of the oven after hours of worthless basting. There will be murmuring and eye-rolling from those who remember yours. Make sure you tell the others, loudly, how you just sit around drinking while your turkey rotates effortlessly around, cooking perfectly. By the time the hosts are finished with excuses as to why their turkey sucks, again, you will be elevated to near rock-god status. Humiliation is an essential part of any family holiday and you want to be the one doing the humiliation.See the review of the Weber chimney charcoal starter for a good tip on that.
B00004VWM1 I waited way too long to buy one of these rotisseries.  What was I thinking?  This thing is fantastic!I cook on my Weber charcoal kettles all the time.  It always comes out great, except for the one time my Beagle chased a deer into the woods and I had to go after her.  I got back about thirty minutes later and my chicken was ruined.  I actually ended up feeding it to my Beagle, so now I am thinking maybe she did it on purpose?  They are pretty smart.  And chasing a deer had to be a ruse to distract me, I mean seriously, what was she going to do if she actually caught the deer?The rotisserie chickens I have cooked so far have turned out much, much better than all the other ways I have cooked chicken over charcoal. And I have cooked chicken a lot of different ways.I have read that rotisseries are self-basting because most of the juices don't drip, they just kind of roll around over the chicken.  Maybe.  But all I know is as long as I take the bird off at around 165 degrees, cover it for about ten minutes, then serve it, it always comes out fantastic.If you have one of these you know what I am talking about.  If you don't, you should get one, you will like it.This is not just for chicken or turkey.  I cooked a chuck roast to slightly over rare and then sliced it up for some excellent roast beef.
B00004VWM1 This Weber Rotisserie is the best grilling item that I have bought so far. I did two Cornish Hens and they were so moist and juicy, I couldn't wait to try a roasting Chicken. Well, I finally tried one, and oh, my God!!!! It was AWESOME!!! The taste was like no other rotisserie Chicken that I have ever eaten!! I cooked it slow, about 3 hours, starting with about 12 coals on each side, using the indirect cooking method. I added more coals every hour to keep the temperature about the same (about 325-350). I experimented with basting it with Beer when I added more coals. I also added soaked hickory wood chips with the coals each time. To die for!!!  I also tried a Pork roast. The same awesome results were obtained. Next I will try a Turkey. I am totally sold on this item, and highly recommend it to anyone who owns a Weber 22-1/2\" kettle grill. You won't be disappointed!!
B00004VWM1 this kettle rotisserie works GREAT. it's a much better design than what's shown in the ad. what I mean by that is the one in the ad shows metal tabs that rest on the grill, with the new design they got rid of the tabs and flared out the bottom of the ring so the whole ring sits on the grill giving it a nice tight seal. it makes controlling the heat much easier than the previous one. WELL DONE WEBER now as far as the motor it's super quiet and works very well. the spit is one piece steel much better than the two piece rods the ring itself is the same quality as the weber kettle grill. I really didn't want to spend that kind of money on it but after receiving and using it I'm glad I did. this unit is well made and expect to get many years of great grilling out of it.
B00004VWM1 This rotisserie is made for weber 22 inch charcoal grills.  I got this from amazon and it shipped in record time.  This is a simple accessory with few parts.  There is the skewer with the two prongs that slide over and screw onto it to hold your meat in place.  There is a big ring that sits on top of your kettle and the lid goes on that.  There's a screw-on counterweight to help with even rotation.  And then the motor that slides onto a bracket on the aforementioned ring.  That's it.  Basically no assembly required.  Do you like beer can chicken?  You won't bother after using this.  I'm not a chef so I can't explain how spinning the meat around makes it so good but it does.  Juiciest bird ever, seriously.  Also does roasts well with excellent results too.  I haven't used this for a turkey but I can't see how that wouldn't be outstanding as well.  The motor is quiet, if you care about that kind of thing.  The plug attached to it is ridiculously short so you will probably need an extension cord.  I recommend keeping the box it comes in for storage because otherwise it's kind of bulky and random in the garage.  The only criticism is it's expensive.  But it's one of the coolest BBQ things i own and would buy another in a heartbeat if it was stolen or broken.  But Weber doesn't make them anymore!  So if you are thinking about this, buy now before they are gone forever.  I wish I could get extra prongs for the skewer so I could do two of whatever I am doing without have to jerry-rig it.
B00004VWM1 This is the best accessory you could own for your grill.  It produces fantastic chickens (I do two at a time), roasts, leg of lamb, and (my favorite) turkey.  My brother-in-law brought his smoked turkey to compare with my rotisserie turkey for Thanksgiving.  My turkey was gone and his was mostly there.If you own a Weber Kettle Grill (22 1/2 inch) you NEED to have one of these.
B00004VWM1 Super fast shipping. Great addition to my Weber 221/2\" Performer barbecue! What's confusing is that I called Weber's customer service and they told me that the rotisserie would not fit the Performer barbecue. OK then I e-mailed there tech staff, e-mail sent back also saying that the rotisserie would not fit the performer!(Neither correspondence could tell me why it wouldn't fit). I read the reviews on Amazon and there were two which said that the rotisserie fit and worked fine on their performers. So I purchased one and they are correct it fits and work's great.Thanks guys!! I will be calling Weber again today to dispute their claims!
B00004VWM1 This Rotisserie is too expensive, but on the other hand it's well built, and does a great job. I bit the bullet and bought it on sale. I'm very pleased with it. I've had other rotisseries for other grills. And while they all do the job, the Weber seems to just float along effortlessly. The motor seems to be well built, and strong. Another reviewer said Weber isn't making this any longer. I have heard that elsewhere as well. It's the perfect match for your grill, so don't wait if you want one. I've done Chicken, Roasts and Pork loin on it, all came out beautifully tender and moist. Once you use this, you'll never make beer-can chicken again. I use it with the Weber charcoal pans for indirect cooking. A match made in heaven, or where ever the Weber factory is!FYI.... I have an old \"Universal fit\" rotisserie from an old grill. I found that the basket it came with, and the meat forks fit well on the Weber spit. Also, the motor fits on the Weber bracket, and the Weber spit fits into the old motor fine.
B00004VWM1 After brining my 13 lb turkey overnight, I started up the coals and set the turkey spinning. A little over 2 hours later, I took it off the grill and let the bird rest on the countertop. The smell drew every teenager in the house to the kitchen. The bird was completely picked over before I was able to make the rest of meal. So much for the other food groups. It was completely devoured. There was literally nothing left. My wife, daughters, and their friends kept repeating, &quot;That was the best turkey I ever had. You deserve a trophy!&quot; We now have their friends calling wanting to know when I'm going to roast another bird.Folks, this is a must-get addition to this grill. Forget about the chicken with the beer can up the old caboose. I am not the most experienced grill master in the world but this thing made me into a neighborhood hero.I'm off to Safeway for another Butterball. I wonder where I'm going to put my next trophy?
B00004VWM1 This rotisserie cooks great.  It adds another dimension to cooking on the Weber grill.  Like some mentioned in the other reviews, the rotisserie does not have a real tight fit with the lower half of the Weber grill.  I don't understand why Weber just did not make the bottom lip of the rotisserie the same as that of the grill cover.  Then it would have been a perfect fit.But regardless, the rotisserie works and cooks great.  I expect many years of rotisserie cooking with this piece of equipment on my grill.
B00004W430 I have one of these to use in the front yard where there are concrete paths. I roll it along as I pull weeds or do other chores in the garden. The fact that there is a rather clumsy storage area doesn't bother me too much, because the advantage is, you can pick up this stool and toss it around easily. You wouldn't be able to do that if the top opened. There's room for snacks, drinks, sunglasses, gardening gloves, a trowel, etc.I also have one that does open and acts as a pull-cart. That one does get more use as I pile bags of mulch on it and drag it around the yard.Both have their purpose. The Hopper Mobile Garden Stool is solid. I'm glad I have it.EDITED to say that I've thought of two more uses for it.1. You could toss it in the trunk of your car and easily take it with you to use as a chair.2. Convince the children that it's a self-propelled 'car' and let them get some exercise.  :)
B00004W430 This little thing works very well for what I bought it for:  something to sit on while I work with my plants and garden that will roll as I work my way across the flower bed/garden.  I'd like it better if the storage compartment was closed in so that I could leave it full of supplies, sitting outside, but I just put it under a table or in my potting shed and it does fine.  Well worth the price.
B00004W430 I use this to work in my raised garden.  It is just the right height and you can carry your tools along with you and not lose them.  When you have arthritis, you have a problem bending to do your lawn and garden duties.  This is the answer.
B00004W430 After I started having trouble with a sore knee, I go this to help me in the garden.  It's lightweight so easy to move around the garden, holds my tools, and is perfectly sized for me to sit on while weeding, planting flowers and everything else.  It has really saved my knees a lot of wear and tear and I am finding it super-convenient for storing my tools.  It even had a holder for my water bottle.  It's great!
B00004W430 If you're a lightweight and looking for something to scoot you along, then this is for you; however, if you're a little on the heavy side even the slightest, the wheels on this hesitate to move smoothly.  The reason is these do not have wheels that are totally rounded on the inside as well as the outside.  Picture a wheel cut in half and each half goes on opposite sides of the garden stool, so the wheel itself is not very supported on the inside.  Now, I have another garden stool I got from Home Depot.  The wheels are round on the inside and out, much stronger, roll smoother and have a seat which you can pick up to use as a handle to haul supplies, kind of like a kid's wagon.  On this you cannot.  So, as I said, if all you want is something to scoot on and you're a skinny-mini type of person, then this will do well for you.  Otherwise, try your local garden center.
B00004W430 This is a very sturdy little item for yard work, but it is very low to the ground to be handy to sit on if you have any back problems or you carry any extra weight.  Would be nice if it was a few inches taller.  The storage compartment under the seat is kinda inaccessible, and it would be nice if the seat popped up so you could get to what you store in there.  Would also be nice to have a \"tongue\" so that you could pull it along.
B00004W430 so cute and just the right size for me. Does not take up a lot of room and rolls great. Strong and durable and very handy and saved my aching back. Absolutely recommend.
B00004W430 This is my second cart.  The old one is still serviceable in the garden after years of HOT and freezing weather.  I use this new one in the house to scoot around cleaning floor boards or anything hard to reach.  Saves my back. I haven't found it has a weight limit.  I have used it to scoot some pretty heavy stuff from place to place.  Unlike the description the top does not open although some of the photos on the box are a different model which does seem to have a hinged side.  No matter I just reach under.  It would be even better with a couple drainage holes. It can sometimes be difficult to roll on rough ground but given its light weight I just move it and sit back down. Highly recommend if bending is hard on your back.
B00004W430 We actually have two garden carts this one and another that is all metal. The metal one even has a seat like those you see on an antique tractor. The metal one looks to be the better one HOWEVER my wife prefers the Garden Hopper over it. It feels sturdier than the metal one and does not tip as easily. I have noticed that the metal one now needs repainted and some bolts replaced. Not so with the Garden Hopper. It has sat out in the sun for days and it's paint has not faded. We do store it inside during the winter but we do that for the metal one too.My complaint is about the hinged lid. It takes too much force to open it. I realize that this is necessary because you don't want the lid coming open when you pick it up to carry it. Honestly it's just a minor complaint to me and does not detract in any way from the quality of this cart.All in all we are both happy with this cart.
B00004W430 All you have to do is pick this thing up to know that it's hollow plastic parts. And all you need to do is sit on it once to know that this is one solid little stool.The manufacturer's catalog that came in the box shows that their other products are children's toys that are built for punishment, yet no so dangerous that they'd crush a child. They've carried that same quality construction through to this little stool.The wheels are a little on the small side to carry my 230-lb body across a patch of healthy lawn with ease, but it wasn't so difficult that I would have to stand up and move it, either.I find it a tad inconvienent to reach under the seat to get to tools. There is a cup holder on the outside, but it's design is such that it isn't good for anything but cups or cans. The one thing I'd like to see here is some other sort of outside storage for tools instead of the cup holder.The all-weather plastic means you can leave it outside, but it's lightweight design means you can store it on an upper shelf, too.All in all, the solid, but lightweight construction makes this one a keeper.
B00004Z2FP I ordered one of these becasue I was tired of pulling weeds from between the cracks on a patio I build that is a slate floor with sand filler surrounded by castle wall bricks with rose bushes behind. We have a lot of weeds that like to pop up and since our dogs play out there and eat grass poison was not an option. I bought this, got it a day later (thanks amazon!) and hooked it up to my grills propane tank. Instantly I lit it (why wait?!?!?) and man was this thing impressive! It's weeding with a flame thrower/torch. You literally only have to pass it over the weeds for a few seconds and they start to wilt. A day or two later they are dead. Now at this point you can pull them eaisly or relight your torch and burn em again! :) It by no means is \"magic\" but it does do the job as long as you aren't expecting the thing to vaporize weeds. It kills the cells of the plant and basically it starves it to death. I do recommend keeping the garden hose handy just because it's a safety issue.
B00004Z2FP I bought this last week direct from the company so that I could take advantage of a bundle deal. Wishing now that I had purchased from Amazon so that I could return this easily.I would imagine that this item would be great if you are using it for grass maybe or in an area that is bricked or concreted. In my case, in the woods with dry leaves on a gravel driveway and wind all the time it is a recipe for disaster. The flame is not very focused and unless you absolutely fry the weeds, they don't die. Even the young ones. I ended up pulling the weeds the next day around the house, but I guess I need to find another solution for my 800 ft. gravel driveway.In negotiation right now trying to return the torch. I'll post later about customer service.
B00004Z2FP I bought this primarily for natural herbicide free weeding. Having an infant crawling around, I was really hesitant about spraying Roundup and having that leeching into the soil, not to mention, our property borders a creek. I ordered this and had it the next day! Hooked it up and immediately began flame throwing. Thankfully, I began in the middle of our brick patio. This baby kicks out quite a flame. It was a breezy day, I suggest using this when there is little to no wind. It doesn't produce a tight concentrated flame like a propane soldering torch for plumbing would.Honestly I almost canceled the order in lieu of the $28 model from Harbor Freight. Thankfully you can't yet do that on an iPod touch or mobile phone. The more I thought about it, do I really want to trust an inferior tool when I am dealing with 100,000 BTU?Do keep a fire extinguisher or hose on hand! I did this the day after a rainstorm, which I'd suggest. Do NOT do it when it is dry outside. Even so, the grass caught on fire a couple of times.Next task.... I have a carpenter ant hill right where the sand box is supposed to go. No need to pesticides, I'll turn the ground and flame away. Not even summer yet, and I can't wait to try this on the ice in the driveway!
B00004Z2FP I've used the \"vaporizer\" twice and love it!  I have a gravel driveway - what a pain to use Roundup to kill the little grasses and weeds sprouting in the spring; it doesn't take much to fry them plus, on a cold day, the gravel gets warmed by the torch so my feet stay toasty.  I was initially concerned about lugging around the big propane tank on my dolly - not a hassle at all, the torch extends about 10 feet out so a big area can be covered.  Just be careful with dry grass - it catches on fire easily so keep an eye out for persistent flames.  Otherwise, a big time-saver - I wish I had some snow or ice to melt.
B00004Z2FP Ease of use is very straight forward with not much to go wrong. Even comes with a sparker. I use this as a log starter for my BBQ Pit and it does a great job. I'm also looking forward to having it this winter to de-ice the walks.
B00004Z2FP Buying this product was some of the best money I ever spent. So much fun I am surprised the government has not made them illegal. I love this product. It doesn't stop weeds from growing back, but you'll actually want the weeds to return so you can burn them again. I am 6'2\" and I wish the handle was 8 inches longer, but still love this product. The hose could be another 2 feet longer, but again, you want to own one of these weeddragons. The first day I had this item I used it for four hours non-stop. I did not want to go inside when it got dark. Get one of these and buy yourself two or three propane bottles. One bottle of propane will last a long time with this baby, but you'll want fresh gas once you discover all the things you can burn with this baby.
B00004Z4MS This is well made and sturdy but I just don't find myself using it because it's so heavy to carry to the garden - especially if you're carrying tools as well.  Instead I usually end up taking along a light plastic low one-step stool from the dollar store.  It's true I do struggle getting up at times without those nice handles to push against but I don't have to lug the heavy thing around and for me that's more of a chore. It just doesn't feel comfortable either - the seat is too high and the kneeler too low and neither is very soft.
B00004Z4MS I love this neat little household \"tool.\" It's compact, light, sturdy, folds up, easy to carry, hose-off-able and makes getting up and down from my knees SO much easier. I even realized that I could bring it inside and it made a perfect stool for cleaning low cabinets or a kneeler for scrubbing baseboards. Absolutely recommend. I'm thinking of getting them as gifts for my home-owning family members and friends.
B00004Z4MS I have owned this bench/kneeler for some years and would not part with it.  It is lightweight but amazingly strong.  It is a ready made seat for me in the garage, and it doesn't take up much space.  I am (unfortunately) 175 pounds, and this bench supports me easily.  Because of arthritis, the kneeler option is a must for me out in the garden not just because of my knees but because the bench's legs will help me stand up.  This is money well spent for anyone you know who is a serious gardener.
B00004Z4MS Just about everybody over the age of thirty has some kind of issue with knee and/or back pain, esp. when you want to do seasonal clean-ups inside or out.I was kind of flabbergasted when I was on my hands and knees, cleaning the bathroom floor, and my knees...hurt!...just from kneeling on the tile. I bought this device to help with that chore, and it's a lifesaver. It's made for outdoor use (and it's one of the sturdiest things I've ever bought), but for me it's been wonderful for indoor cleaning.The reviews here are excellent, so I don't want to reinvent that wheel. There are just two things I'd add from my own observations; that is, things you might not know until you actually order and get this kneeler.First of all, the yellow pad is on both sides, it's not just padded one one side. Now as it's show in this picture, it's something to sit on. If you burn it upside down so the yellow pads are a few inches off the floor, behold! It's a kneeler! The metal \"arms\" that become long when you flip it over are extremely sturdy. If you have problems working on the floor and getting up, they'll hold your weight easily and make getting off the floor a breeze (you don't even have to be kneeling ON it to use it as a sturdy prop to stand up.)The other thing is that the device is folded up when you get it. To use it, you just open one \"leg,\" then the other. Some folks seem to have problems folding it back up (very easy to store.) To do this, look for the springs on each side. There is a metal bar that runs perpendicular to the springs. Grasp the bar AND the spring section and squeeze. It's very resilient. You don't have to force the two bars together, but just enough to loosen the knobs that click into place when you open the device. When you squeeze (and yes, it's a bit hard if you're a woman), push the arm down, and one half is folded. Do the same with the other side, and you're done. (To open it, just open each arm. It locks into place with no effort.)You don't have to be an AARP member to find this device to be incredibly useful. I bought two: one for indoors and one for outside stuff. I absolutely recommend it if you find that your glucosamine and chondroitin tablets are taking awhile to kick in with that knee pain!
B00004Z4MS For all the reasons the other reviewers listed, this item has become one of my \"must-have-it-with-me\" tools when I work in the garden. I love it!
B00004Z4MS This product enables those who have difficulty bending down to be able to work in the garden effectively and with ease.  It is easy to set up and collapse for storage.  It was priced fairly.
B00004ZAVI 
B00004ZAVI I really like this bird feeder but not for the fact that squirrels can't get into it. I have two dogs that make sure that doesn't happen. Heck half the time they don't even let the birds on it. But I love it because I went out the other day and four of my six bird feeders looked fine and had seed in them but when I inspected them the seed mix had gotten wet and clumped up so it no longer would come out of the feeder. Not this feeder! The water can't get in to the seed area because the squirrel begone hood. This was the only feeder that was completely empty even though it was the newest edition and held the most seed. It's a hit with me, the birds, and maybe even the dogs!
B00004ZAVI This is a study feeder, with a tube 4.5\" in diameter.  The seed comes out the bottom of the tube into a small tray that goes around the tube.  The birds can feed through 4 holes in a metal sleeve that is suspended by a spring from the bottom of the tube.The main selling points on bird feeders seems to be 1) How squirrel-proof is it, 2) how long will it last, and 3) how much does it cost?  I will add a 4th of my own requirements, and that is how deer-proof is it.  I have had deer come in Winter and tilt myPerky-Pet 7103-2 Copper Triple Tube Bird Feederfeeder and drain the whole thing in a night.  The hoof-prints in the snow gave them away.  ;-)So this feeder appears to be both squirrel- and deer-proof.  Tilting the feeder does lose some seed, but it does not flow out very easily, especially when the bottom part is pulled down like when a squirrel or deer is trying to get into it.  The top dome also tilts when weight is on it, which will certainly cause squirrels and chipmunks to slide off.  I think it's a good design.How long will it last?  They claim a heavy-duty, powder coated finish, which I assume is over standard steel.  The spring inside the bottom part to make it tilt I assume is steel as well.  So this feeder will likely rust in maybe 5+ years, and once the spring rusts away, the bottom will fall off the tube - the spring is the only thing holding it on.  You will have to get a new spring from Perky Pet.  Aluminum or stainless steel would be better materials.How much does it cost?  This feed is on the expensive side, especially not knowing what materials it's made of and how long it will last.  I would wait for a price-reduction from the list price.
B00004ZAVI As a serious bird enthusiast, I have a fairly elaborate setup to attract them and have many.  This feeder seemed a good addition, but there are problems.  To begin with, when it arrived the black cap that covers the spring mechanism in the interior bottom of the feeder was loose in the box.  I don't think it was supposed to be as the directions didn't mention it and it was quite hard to reattach.  The feeder is really big, but not big enough for me to get my arm all the way down inside it to replace this part.  I finally got it placed by using a reacher/grabber gadget, but couldn't get it pushed down firmly.  As a result I expect problems sooner or later.  Right now it's working, though.The directions did show how to attach the pieces of the top, but I found it annoying that you can't set the feeder down with both the lid and the dome pieces attached as they come apart.  I figured out that the dome shaped cover piece is supposed to stay hung at the location you've chosen and only the tube with its lid is to be removed from the underside hook for refilling.Regarding the refilling:  On the good side, the big open tube is easy to fill with most scoops and can accommodate a wide mouth funnel that further speeds filling and minimizes spilled seed.  On the down side, detaching and reattaching the lid is awkward since the tiny side wires of the lid have to fit into equally tiny holes pierced in the tube, and which aren't easily visible since they are slightly recessed under the lid.  You have to squeeze the tube a bit to make it wide enough for the pins to get inside, then releasing it lets them seat if you have them in the correct position.  These holes are very near the top of the tube and should they break when the plastic is hard, during the winter, for example, the whole feeder becomes useless.  The whole weight of this feeder hangs on the two little holes in the plastic which are only about \" from the top of the tube. Only time will tell how long the feeder lasts and given the fact that one assumes squirrels will be jumping on it, trying to get at the seed, I have concerns.Another issue I have with the feeder is that the perches are very short.  So far only the tiniest birds have been able to feed from it, the chickadees and wrens.  Others may get the hang of it and I put the best no mess seed in it to encourage them.  I'll just have to wait and see.I have several feeders, all of which are very sturdy and need to be. For one thing, they can easily tip over on the uneven gravel where I fill them, which I have to do as often every other day during heavy feeding times.  They are almost never without many birds vying for the best perch and suffer regular attacks from crows and squirrels.  Both these marauders mostly enjoyed the tray feeder as all the others are tube feeders and squirrel proof (not that they don't get worked over).  I hated to have to remove the tray as some of the birds I most prize seeing prefer it, but the crows and squirrels drive me nuts.  So far this feeder has deterred both, which is a definite plus.Considering how expensive this feeder is, I expect it to do a good job at both satisfying my birds and deterring squirrels--and it has to last a long time.  I'll update after an extended trial period.  I've only had it up a week at this point.  Maybe it will grow on me.Update 9/18/13:  I left my other feeders empty for a while so the birds would work harder to use this one and the finches and titmice have decided it's okay.  The bigger birds still can't get purchase, but at least it's useful for the smaller ones.  It was easy to refill.  I feel a bit more positive toward it at this point.Update 10/12/13: Not feeling so positive anymore as the top broke off while refilling today making the feeder essentially useless because you can't rehang it.  Some super glue might work to reattach the hanging wire to the lid.
B00004ZAVI I probably would of given this a better score if the design of where the two little prongs are, was different. They support all the weight of this big bird feeder, and its heavy when filled...its good its a big one, filling less often interests me. BUT...the large plastic tube has two little holes drilled in it to have a little piece of metal stick into each hole to hold this, and I am thinking in time, just from the elements and the sun/heat that with taking this apart to fill, refill, etc the plastic will fatigue...then you have a very expensive bird feeder that the squirrels can't even TRY to get into anymore.To me the design of it and how it will probably not last too long is important as this is a pricy feeder. On the upside, it was easy to assemble. I was interested as to where it was made, it says its made in the USA of US and CHINA parts. Draw your own conclusions.
B00004ZAVI This is a decently made product, fairly sturdy and easy to put together. The nut holding the hook together seems to be too small and threaded incorrectly, but it appears to be holding together fairly well none-the-less.Squirrels still mange to use this product as their very own buffet, but they are not able to chow down as fast on the sun flower seeds I fill it with as they can with some other feeders. That is saving me from having to re-fill this as fast as I have had to fill some other supposedly \"squirrel proof feeders\".The mechanism on the bottom where the food come out is very clever in that it tilts and provides no way for the squirrel to hang on for more than a few moments before dropping to the ground. I am sure that given enough time, the squirrels will find a way to bypass this.What bothers me is the price. This is a fairly high end product for what it is. The only other feeders I've used that are in the same price range is byDroll Yankees YCPT-360 Tipper 4-Port Hanging Bird Feeder(although I am sure there are more expensive brands out there) and my Droll Yankee feeders have withstood the test of time. I've had some of them now for 6 or 7 years and they are still doing an outstanding job.If this product last even for three years it might be worth it, but the look and feel of the plastic makes me wonder if it can hold u to frigid winters, sharp beaks and claws and high winds without damage
B00004ZAVI I also had the wrong-sized nut/bolt to tighten the baffle, so getting the top hook and baffle off and on to add seed has been a pain. I've been meaning to get another nut for it, but just haven't had time.Assembly is easy, though I have to admit, I didn't quite see how to get the top off an on initially. You have to kind-of squeeze the sides of the plastic tube to get the top off and I wonder how long that'll hold up before it cracks. It does seem to be very study plastic, but we'll see. I do have my doubts about two little metal prongs in two little plastic holes holding up to 3lbs. of seed for extended periods of time.This feeder holds a LOT of seed. The birds took to it immediately. To date, we have not seen any squirrels on it, nor try to access it.I currently have two other feeders from Droll Yankee with lifetime warranties and they are still holding up after six years. Based on this cost and the quality issue with the top nut/bolt, I think there are better options out there.
B00004ZAVI Between the weight controlled port closure and the tilting and wobbling dome, this bird feeder certainly lives up to its claim of being squirrel proof, BUT it lets so much birdseed fall out of the bottom as the base tilts under the weight of even the tiniest bird that squirrels and large birds can gather up as much birdseed they wish.Probably not quite the solution to the problem you were looking for.Note: The bird feeder comes mostly assembled, and I made no attempt to check the already assembled parts.  After a month one of the perches somehow unscrewed itself and fell off.  I recovered the perch and the nut but could not find the locking washer.  If the locking washer was never there, that would readily explain how the perch came off, and when I checked the other three they were still tight.  So it might be worth a couple of minutes of your time checking that all four perches are screwed in tight when you first unpack it.
B00004ZAVI It's sturdy, a plus. It's engineered to keep squirrels from damaging it and eating the feed. That works too. It's attractive, another plus. Add that up and you get about 2 and a half stars.BUT...BUT...BUT...The design is not only unfriendly to the squirrels, but it is alsoBIRD UNFRIENDLY.I waited a long time, several weeks to review watching the feeder just off my patio where hangs several other feeders. During that time only one house finch ate from the feeder, only once. The design is not one that readily attracts birds. They have to discover where it is the feed is offered. It's almost hidden unless they actually perch. They don't want to do that.Other feeders with a mesh feed reservoir nearby were super actively being used at the same time this new feeder was ignored. So if it's called a bird feeder and the birds don't like the design, then that's a giant multi-star negative. I can't recommend this feeder over the other styles, even though it is strong enough to discourage the bushy tails. Less expensive feeders are not squirrel detracting, but for the price, perhaps could be replaced once or twice at a lesser price. And they will allow you to watch birds actually eating seeds.Bottom line: keep looking. I really wanted this feeder to work, but it will not be used much longer. I'm listening to the golden finches and chickadees who said \"No.\"
B00004ZAVI Update and downgrade. I'm downgrading this to two stars because the birds simply don't like it. I've had it up or a long time now and it is surrounded by four other feeders that all do a brisk business. This feeder has the same seed and yet the birds try it once and then ignore it. I'm convinced the seed is simply too difficult to extract and so the bird give up. There are much better feeders on the market and I would start with any feeder from Droll Yankee such asDroll Yankees YF Flipper 4-Port Hanging Bird Feeder. Updated on 1/24/2014.I have a large \"feeder station\" outside of a picture window in my den and over the years I've tried a lot of feeder designs--some just because I was looking for the best made and best designed feeders and some because I wanted to defeat squirrels. I'm in Connecticut and there are lots of gray squirrels here and they are amazingly clever (and funny) when it comes to getting food from a bird feeder. And they are determined little creatures. I finally found a method to keep squirrels out of my feeders 100% of the time, and I'll get to that at the end of this review. But I'm still willing to try new ideas and it would be fun to find a feeder that solves the squirrel issue all on its own. I'm not sure that this feeder does that, but time will tell.This is a larger feeder than I thought it was going to be-and that's a pleasant surprise.  It also seems pretty well made, but I have some doubts about some of its construction features. Here are some pros & cons:Pros:*The dome on top and the lid look as though they'll keep the food dry from rain or snow entering through the top of the feeder. Wet food can grow mold and that is very dangerous to birds.*As I said it's a large-capacity feeder and  holds three pounds of seed. That's pretty substantial, so I like that feature.*It was simple to assemble, all that  you really have to do is attach the lid at the top of the tube and then put the hanging loop (using a small nut) on the dome. Took less than two minutes to assemble everything. Unlike the Droll Yankee feeders that I use, the perches were already installed and that saves time. On many of the Droll Yankee feeders you have to tap them through holes in the plastic tube and that requires freezing the posts (to shrink them) and that's a pain.*Overall it seems very well made, but with a bird feeder it often takes months and some severe weather to find its flaws--so I'll update this review in a month or so.Cons:*First and foremost, I am not crazy about the way the base tilts down. The idea is that the squirrel will fall off (from its own weight tilting the base) but it appears to me that a squirrel could catch its paw in the feeding station opening if the base starts to tilt after he's on the feeder. I'm not completely sure that that's a possibility, but I was able to get my finger caught (gently) between the moving base and the stationery feeding tray. I certainly don't want to look out and see a squirrel hanging by its paw. Again, the risk may be pretty low, but the way this is designed, the feeding perches are attached to a collar (that has holes through which the birds feed off of an interior tray) and that's what moves. It's easier to understand once you have the feeder in front of you.*Also, I prefer a feeder that has a catch tray underneath to catch the spilled seed. Instead, this tray has openings in the base so that food that falls off of the internal feeding tray falls out through slots in the bottom of the feeder (again, much easier to see when you have the feed in front of you).  The problem with food falling on the ground is that it brings rats and mice. When there is a catch try, the food gets eaten by the birds.*The tube seems a bit too flexible to me. The way that you mount the lid, for example, is to squeeze it a bit and slide in two prongs on the lid (the lid, not the dome, they are two separate things). It seems to me like the prongs could have been a tiny bit longer to keep it attached more securely--and also, every time you grab the tube, you squeeze it and the lid can pop off. Not a major flaw, it's minor, but it's an issue. The Droll Yankee feeders have a lid that slides up and down, you don't have to remove it and it fits very securely. I'm not sure if the plastic tube on a Yankee feeder is thicker or not, they may be exactly the same.You might think that from the cons that I don't like this feeder, but that's not quite true. I am willing to keep it up for a while and see how it works, both in keeping squirrels away and in just feeding the birds. If I don't see squirrels hanging by their paws or find a lot of food on the ground, I'll be satisfied. As I said, I like the capacity and I th
B00004ZAVI We have some pretty fat squirrels in our yard that have managed to get into every bird feeder we have.  It has been about a summer month and I am actually surprised to say that we have not seen them eating out of this one.  We have seen them look and survey but we have not seen them even try to get on this one.  So far it has worked well to keep the squirrels at bay.  The two downsides to this feeder are that there are only four posts/holes for the birds to get to the seed so only one or maybe two birds will eat at one time.  The other downside is the ridiculous price.  At over 70 dollars one might as well invite the birds out to dinner and a movie.  I can't imagine how the manufacturer can justify the price for this thing.  The top and bottom are metal but the tube is just thin plastic.  How pissed would you be if you bought this filled and hanged it and it fell and cracked the tube?!
B00004ZAVI When I received this product, the bolt to tighten the baffler was not the correct size so I called the manufacturer. They were quick to respond and sent me a second whole bird feeder. The issue with the second one is that it was missing all of the hardware. Since I received this as part of the Vine program, I was not going to waste any more of my time trying to get this manufacturer to ship out the correct parts.We gerryrigged the baffler, but it makes removing it to put more seed in very laborious. So far after 2 weeks no birds. It does take awhile to get birds to a new feeder.Why the one star? Too expensive and the manufacturer has obvious problems with packaging. Not worth the time and money. Buy something for less money. A hint on keeping squirrels away from feeders is to remove any from areas where squirrels can jump to. We have six feeders and no squirrels. Now deer are another thing altogether!
B00004ZAVI We have quite a few mature trees in our yard which provide an ideal place for bird feeders. Anyway that's what I thought when we moved here. I hung several of the birdhouse style feeders and in no time the squirrels and chipmunks figured out how to scare the birds away and skillfully scatter their meal on the ground. I watched some even work in tandem to steal the bird food.Perky-Pet has recently released their latest in a line of anti-squirrel bird feeders. They call this one the Perky-Pet Squirrel-Be-Gone: The Baffler (Model 397). If you have ever observed a rodent at work, they are clever and persistent in their desire to secure food and housing for themselves. As you can probable see by the photo this bird feeder has a long clear plastic seed tube that makes up the body of the feeder and providing a visible place to store the bird seed. The bird feeder dimensions are 25 in. H x 11.7 in. W x 11.7 in. D; the seed tube is about 4 inches in diameter and will hold a substantial amount of seed, up to 3 pounds! Here is a promotional blurb I found on this product from Perky-Pet:\"Best Used For: Attracting and feeding birds without allowing squirrels to get the seed. This unique squirrel-proof feeder will increase your bird traffic while minimizing seed lost to squirrels.\"This feeder has an attractive shiny metal saucer-shaped lid (or as Perky-Pet calls it \"a dome\") that connects to the top of the plastic seed tube. There is a hole at the center of the saucer to connect the two parts and at the same time provides a place for a ring to be fastened on the top of the dome for hanging. The dome is part of this new squirrel-baffling bird feeder, along with a very cleverly designed metal base that comes already attached to the bottom of the seed tube. There are four holes (or ports) about the size of dime around the metal base right through the seed tube. These holes are the feeding ports. Small perches are also attached to the base in front of each feeding port and are made out of metal just like the base for durability. Considering the dimensions of the perches and the feeding ports this bird feeder is obviously made for small lightweight birds; No crows or pigeons allowed!Now let's get to the patented weight-activated base and other features of this squirrel-baffling bird feeder. The smooth metal dome is not secured tightly to the top of the seed tube which allows it to wobble around when any weight is applied from above or below; like from a squirrel or large bird. According to Perky-Pet: \"The dome tilts and wobbles as well to throw squirrels off balance who try and land on the feeder.\" This also applies to those pesky crows that dominate our backyard in the mornings, scaring away the smaller birds we are trying to feed. Likewise, if weight is applied to the base, such as by a leaping squirrel, chipmunk or a large bird, the base swivels like a bucket under their weight, automatically closing off access to the feeder ports and preventing the loss of seed.There is very little assembly required. Perky-Pet has included an excellent sheet of instructions that are easy to follow and is written in English only. In fact, there are only two steps to complete assembly. All assembly applies to attaching the dome to the seed tube; everything else comes already assembled. During assembly one thing concerned me. The seed tube is plastic and there are two small holes on opposite sides to attach the dome to the seed tube by poking the ends of a metal bracket through the holes. This feeder is not light and once 3 pounds of birdseed is added it is quite heavy. In my opinion, this is the weakest link of the Perky-Pet bird feeder. In order to prevent a future disaster I decided to drill-out the small holes so I could insert a 2-piece hard rubber grommet into each new hole. This allowed me to still insert the metal bracket as designed while also providing reinforcement for the plastic seed tube. Only time will tell whether my modification will prolong the life of the feeder, or not.Perky-Pet has three short and informative videos on their website explaining (1) How the Squirrel-Be-Gone Baffler works, (2) Where to place your bird feeder and (3) Instructions for cleaning the feeder. You can Google the website by typing the following in your browser window: perky-pet squirrel-be-gone baffler model 397.I had originally intended to hang the bird feeder on one of my wrought iron shepherd staff hanging poles but decided not to when I realized the bottom of this 25-inch bird feeder would only be hanging about 3 feet off the ground; much too low and inviting for the numerous non-flying animals that roam around my backyard. After I watched the videos mentioned above I decided to relocate my bird feeder to a higher point and nearer to our birdbath; I also added a hook to the end of the metal strap I am now using to hang the feeder from a protruding galvanized metal pole mounted horizontally on the bottom roof line of a large shed in the backyard. I have to use a stepladder to hang and remove the bird feeder, but that is no problem. This product was built in the USA with both U.S. and Chinese parts. The label information on the front of the box is written in English, French and Spanish.Overall I am pleased with this new bird feeder. The squirrels and crows have tried to access the feeder without success so far; the wobble and tilt action has definitely kept them off guard. However, they are crafty and persistent animals and since there has been a minor amount of seed loss, mostly during the recent wind storm, the seed that did fall to the ground has kept them motivated to devise new ways to thwart the security measures built into this new Perky-Pet bird feeder.On the front of the box Perky-Pet added the following statement:\"Feeder base and dome tilt to baffle the squirrels and protect your bird seed! Birds feed undisturbed from 4 feeding ports.\"I think Perky-Pet is overreaching reasonable expectations for this product by expecting small birds to feed undisturbed. There is always some animal around my neighborhood looking for a free meal; either in the form of birdseed or in the shape of a bird. Though it would be nice, so far undisturbed feeding is not the norm around here.Otherwise, The Baffler has worked as promised. Since there are moving parts it stands to reason that some attention will be necessary in the future to ensure the mechanisms continue to wiggle, tilt and wobble. There is no mention about maintenance on the Perky-Pet website that I could find. Only time will tell how well this new feeder will work over the long haul. Since much of the Perky-Pet Squirrel-Be-Gone: The Baffler is manufactured with metal parts I expect my Perky-Pet bird feeder will outlast most if not all of the plastic and wooden bird feeders on the market. This bird feeder retails new for $73.99, which is a hefty price for what you are purchasing. I know you can shop around and buy this bird feeder for much less than that.
B00004ZAVI It's really almost too big a bird feeder and the perch legs are too short.  Only little birds can land on the legs and they're not likely to do so with such a massive feeder.  It's expensive, it's difficult to clean because of the way the lid attaches to the base. The feed holes are too small as well. I would pass on this; just too many negatives.
B00004ZAVI I have this hanging outside for a month now, and I'm still waiting to see a squirrel fall off it. They don't seem interested in investigating it yet - perhaps the dome is doing its job of keeping the squirrel away from the perch. The perch is supposed to tilt when a squirrel clings on to it, both denying the squirrel access to the birdseed, as well as throwing it off balance and possibly off the feeder.The feeder comes with the top unassembled. My first problem with it came when I tried to assemble it. The nut provided did not hold the dome securely - when I put a light pressure (say, 2 pounds) on the dome, it will push the nut off the hook. I called customer support, who offered to replace the entire feeder. I decided to get a replacement nut from the hardware store instead. Strangely, I could not find a nut that fit exactly, with either metric or Imperial threading - so the problem might be with the threaded hook. However, two metric threaded nuts worked where 1 didn't.The reason why I'm worried about how long this will last is that the seed tube is made of plastic. Near the top, a metal rod goes through holes on either side of the tube. There's no reinforcement, and this being a rather large feeder, a lot of weight is being supported by a bit of plastic.There also doesn't look like a good way of disassembling the bottom of the feeder in order to wash it properly.I haven't yet seen a squirrel being thwarted by this yet, so I'll rate it based on my observation of it so far. I'll update the review when I have more information.
B00004ZAVI This is an attractive looking, functional feeder and was easy to assemble. The only problem I had was that the unit shipped with the wrong size nut needed to secure the baffle to the hook. Nothing I had at home would fit properly either. I took the hook to my local hardware store and the correct nut is a metric size. Twenty cents later I had the correct part and was able to complete the assembly.I have had the feeder hanging in a tree for a few weeks now and the little birds love it. They took to it within a day or two. [It sometimes takes a week or so for the birds to find a new feeder. I have four other feeders in my yard so the regulars are used to finding food here.] The larger birds have trouble with the little perches. This keeps the Grackles and Starlings from emptying the feeder but it also discourages the Cardinals.The squirrels and chipmunks have not been able to get to the seed by climbing the feeder - however - there is a fair amount of spillage from the tray which ends up on the ground. The chipmunks are having a feast sitting underneath it. The additional of a seed catcher would be nice.The true test of a feeder is whether it will withstand a Midwest winter and ever hungrier squirrels as natural food supplies dwindle. Right now the squirrels aren't that interested. They are curious and jump on it, but don't try too hard. I'm also concerned about the sturdiness of the plastic and how well it will hold up when temperatures go below freezing. I will update as the seasons progress.
B00004ZAVI ok i was so hoping to love this bird feedersadly i do notfirst off right out of the box i had to call in to get a new hook for hangingwhenever we tried to screw it in then hang it up all came crashing right back down againthe nut was too big so there was simply no way to tighten it like it was supposed to begot the new one it and same thing happened so had to finally just go to a hardware store to jimmy rig iti see in reading reviews we are not the only ones with this issuethen other issue we have is not the easiest thing to fill with the feedand once all the way full wowzers is it heavy we had to change the hook it was onbecause of the weight then i just finally hung it right from the treethen on the issue about being squirrel proofi get the concept but with ours they still try to mess with itand shake the sillies out of it and once in a great while they do manage to knock it hard enoughthat some spills out of it crazy i know but i saw it happen for myselfnow granted maybe out beasts are just more crazy than othersreally they did not get tons of the food not like in the other feeder that we havefor the price i am not so convinced this is the right feeder for our birdsthey really do not seem to like it all that welli see them on the other feeders more than this onenot sure if the poles maybe are too short or whatwe have blue jay cardinals blue buntings and many other small birds too numerous to name them allthe little ones really do not like it at allthe bigger ones i see on it more than the little guysi had to give it a 3 because i feel the design could have been betterand i had to be the one to figure out how to get the top to even work rightand i really feel it is simply too big but maybe that is just for our situation
B00004ZAVI My back yard is a haven for all sorts of wildlife- not just birds, but rabbits, squirrels, chipmunks and the occasional skunk. I choose plants that encourage wildlife, and I never use pesticides or herbicides. I've never had a bird feeder, though. I was always worried about the effects of artificially feeding birds, but I was recently reassured by a naturalist that birds get their food from a great many sources, and one more source really won't make a difference. And so I ordered this feeder.Looking at the list price, you'd expect it to be a pretty hefty, solidly-built device. If you did, though, you'd be wrong. There are a couple of stampings, a molded base, a thin plastic tube, a couple of springs, some pieces of steel rod for perches... and that's it. It comes mostly preassembled, requiring only that you attach the mounting ring at the top of the feeder. That piece did give me some concern, as the main thing supporting several pounds of seed and feeder is a skinny #6 screw. New, it has more than enough strength, but a few years outdoors might weaken it through corrosion.Filling the feeder is easy, although my first attempt resulted in a pound of birdseed scattered on my back porch. It was running out through the bottom of the feeder, and I couldn't figure out why until I discovered a black plastic cap about an inch in diameter lying in the bottom of the box. It's not shown in the wordless assembly instructions, but I managed to figure out that kit is supposed to close off the bottom of the seed chamber. It slips on to part of the molding that composes the inside of the base, with less than 1/2\" of overlap. The only thing really holding it in place is the weight of the birdseed in the tube. Once the level of the seed falls below this cap, it could easily become dislodged, and the seed inside could run out. I considered gluing it on but that would make it impossible to access the springs inside if they became unhooked or broke. Once I had this figured out, filling the feeder was easy enough, although I was also concerned that the tube is suspended by two very thin steel wires that are inserted in two small holes in the plastic tube. This also seems like a potential point of failure.  I hung the feeder under my maple tree, using a lightweight steel chain- something squirrels were unlikely to be able to chew though.That was several days ago, and since then we've had two heavy rainstorms, neither of which managed to get any water into the feeder. That's good. I haven't seen any squirrels try to get in, and I don't see any seed spilled below the feeder- which suggests that perhaps the birds have yet to discover the feeder. It may well be that food is plentiful enough this time of year that the birds really are stressed enough to look for new food sources. I suspect that when cold weather comes, they might be a bit more motivated. I'll be watching the feeder regularly between now and then (my home office has a clear view of the feeder) and I'll update as the birds and squirrels discover the feeder. I'll also update if any parts fail along the way.Update: A close inspection of the ground below shows evidence that the birds have indeed discovered the feeder, and it looks like the level of seed may have dropped a bit- I'm going to put a mark on the tube to monitor the level. No signs of squirrel activity.Update II: The birds have definitely discovered it. There isn't too much wasted seed on he ground, but the level of seed has fallen least rabble, and I've observed several birds feeding on- and right now it looks like two robins are having a bit of a fight over who has priority on it. Still can't give it any more than three stars, given the cost and construction, but it's good to see that the birds are making use of it.Update III: The birds- or a combination of birds and other scavengers- are now consuming seed at a rate of two or three pounds a day from the feeder. I just refilled it, and  I noticed a good deal of seed on the ground as well. As I type this on my back porch, there are four small birds on the feeder, and about eight or nine scavenging seed on  the ground below.A this point I'm undecided as to whether I'll keep filling the feeder, get another, smaller, feeder, or just discontinue feeding until winter. I'll probably buy another 20 lb bag before I make up my mind.Followup: It's now June, and the feeder has been hanging in my yard since last August. It doesn't look any worse for the wear. There are no paint chips, no rust, no cracks in the plastic reservoir. In short, it looks pretty much the way it did when I hung it 10 months ago.  I've discovered a number of things since first hanging it, too. Most commercial seed mixes at the big box stores are full of milo, a seed that no bird appears to care for, although they'll eat it in an emergency. The best deals are to be found at country feed stores, buying mixes or making your own. I use a mixture that's mainly of black sunflower seed, some cracked corn, safflower seed, and occasionally some cracked peanuts. This has something for just about every bird found around here, and has drawn a much wider range of birds to my yard than I've seen in the past 27 years. I plan on adding a noter feeder or two, using different mixes in them feeders to get different birds, and maybe add a few birdhouses as well.July Update: I was working at one end of the yard when I heard a crash and turned just in time to see a squirrel sailing through the air after bouncing off the roof of the feeder. They still haven't figured out a way in, but one or two of the smarter ones may have realized than sitting on the feeder and shaking it can dislodge seed do they can eat what falls to the ground below- see the photo.
B00004ZAVI There really is a lot to like about this bird feeder. I live in the Pacific Northwest in extreme Western Washington, and this is now one of 6 feeders that I have so YMMV (your mileage may vary).I have waited some time before adding this review to observe how my birds have adjusted to the feeder. It has taken some time, but they are, very slowly ,and very gradually, becoming more used to it and using it a bit more. The chickadees and the nut-hatches are finally responding and are feeding from the feeder with greater frequency. The slow start to use this feeder seems to be that in order to get to the seed the birds have to stick their heads into the openings, something many birds seem to be hesitant to do it seems.The Good:1.  Very well constructed with quality materials. This feeder will last a long time and, I think, will hold up to weather and use.2.  It performs as advertised, and it really does thwart squirrels, and for my location, raccoons as well.3.  The top also also has the added advantage of keeping the food more dry in wet conditions thanks to the overhang from the anti-squirrel proof curved top.The Not So Good:1.  Many of the birds seem very hesitant to use this feeder, as mentioned above it may be because they really hae to stick their head into the opening to get to the seed. I use a \"premium\" blend. Perhaps another sort of feed mix would be more attractive to them> I'm not sure since this blend has had them doing through 20#of seed in a week generally.2.  The level of seed has not gone down much in this feeder after nearly three weeks of use. The birds have been coming to the feeder a little more each day though, so I am cautiously hopeful. I hope that they will gradually become more accustomed to the feeder, but it is a slow process for them it seems.3.  I have not had such a slow response to any other feeder, and Perky Pets feeders have always been a favorite choice for me.So - you see that I don't have a very solid positive answer for this feeder, nor can I say definitively that it does not work. Perhaps the species that you generally attract may make a difference?We attract chickadees, nuthatches, flickers, woodpeckers, various finches, cedar wax wings, juncos, doves, and a host of smaller birds. I have a year round population.I want to love this feeder because it really is made well, but at this point, about 3 weeks after purchase I have some reservations. I have seen an increase in use since I first put it up.
B00004ZAVI This is exactly the bird feeder I've been looking for. We have a serious problem with very \"intelligent\" squirrels. They've managed to get into every bird feeder I've used and ruined most of them. This feeder is sturdy. It also works to keep the squirrels off, at least so far. I hung it on a moderately high branch where it's easy for me to fill and so far the birds have figured it out, but the squirrels are kept at bay. I hope this continues.The feeder can hold three pounds of seed. That, of course, depends on the type of see you use. This is another plus for me. We have a lot of birds here and the other feeders would run out after one or two days. So far this one has lasted a week.The price is rather high, although not all that much worse than the feeders in the stores in town, but if it keeps the squirrels away and lasts several seasons, it's worth it. It's certainly better than investing in a new bird feeder every year and having it ruined.
B00004ZAVI Our last two birdfeeders have been smaller Perky-Pet models and they've been fine. Priced at about $20, and perfectly serviceable and bird-popular even if squirrels have easily solved them.So I wanted to see how Perky-Pet's high-end \"squirrel-be-gone\" model would work. I did not pay for it, but got it free through the Amazon Vine review program.As a product it's well-made and while I think a smart squirrel will still get some food out of it, I do think this will make it difficult for them. The way the food dispenser tilts and wobbles will make it very difficult for an animal to maintain a long grip. They'll fall, and while they'll come back, they'll fall again.My other feeder, the squirrel could just hang out until I squirted him with water. This one will make them work much harder, and hopefully he gets tired of it and moves on.But is that worth $75? I just don't see how. Bird seed's not that expensive, so even if a squirrel does eat a bunch of seed, how long would it take for him to eat $50 worth of seed? However, I only deal with one smart squirrel - so if you've got several, then it's a different issue. Still, the price seems high for what is basically a fun luxury item.This is a big feeder. I have the tallest shepherd's crook, and this hangs down far enough to be difficult to see under the railings of my porch. Luckily, we can see two of the four portals even if it's a little obstructed. The point is that this is a large 3-pound feeder, and will be a big change if you're used to those smaller, cheaper versions.The size is matched with quality. This has some weight to it, and is not one of those cheap plastic models that seems to age very quickly. I think this model will have a longer useful life. I usually get rid of a feeder once a year, usually after winter, but I bet this one would last.Ultimately, while I like the product and I think it's well-made and should live up to most of its claims, the price makes it so I can't go above three stars. But - a $75 feeder that last 4-5 years is better than paying $20 for a new feeder after every winter. So IF this lasts 3-4 years I would have a different opinion.The birds use this fine - like any new feeder, took a few days, but once they got used to it they all sit there and eat all day.
B00004ZAVI A rather large, mostly plastic feeder intended to deter squirrels.It's larger than I expected, and flimsier.  The tube isn't quite as rigid as I'd like, the top is attached by a single small bolt/nut, and the bottom is attached via a single spring.  I'm not sure how many seasons this construction will hold up through the variable, wet winters we have here in Maryland (frequent changes from cold to warmer).The unit arrives mostly assembled.  For storage, the top has to come off (since the top is a \"baffle\", it flops over in storage).  Since the feeding ports are only at the bottom of the feeder, I had to hang it a little higher than I had planned (so it was still visible from my ground floor windows).  Even so, I have to stand near the window to see the feeding ports.The large capacity means less refills are needed, but between lots of seed sitting out, and the design that seems will encourage seed to stick to the bottom of the feeder, I'm concerned I'll get moldy seed and have to scrub this thing out more often than I like-- I prefer the kind where I can easily dump out the dregs without scrubbing or washing.The baffle is pretty garden-variety, and I've seen my squirrels handily climb over baffles like this one (it's not particularly wide nor does it swing/swivel vary hard). The bottom design is innovative and seems like a squirrel clinging would cause the port nearest the squirrel to close, but the crafty little rodents may be able to twist their bodies to still get to the port on the other side.So far, the only birds who've discovered the feeder are chickadees who are trying to get seed from the ports but seem off-put by how far in they have to reach to do so.  That means at this point, I'm not sure how well the feeder works, since neither most of the birds nor my squirrels have discovered the new source of food.  I'm not sure if it's the unusual feeder configuration (my usual feeder is a hanging platform with an anti-squirrel grid), or that the temperature fall has meant lots of other food options for the local fauna.  I'll update once I get more activity, particularly of the furry kind.UPDATE: The chickadees figured it out first, and still are the ones who most like this feeder.  The tufted titmouses use it some also, but I haven't seen any larger birds on this feeder.  The only squirrel observed was eating spilled seed under the feeder, rather than trying to get into the feeder.  One morning I found the feeder in pieces on the ground (nothing broken, the nut/bolt apparently came out of the hook), which might have been the result of a curious raccoon-- but reinforces my concerns about the feeder's construction, so I'm maintaining the 3-star rating.For the time being, I like the idea of this feeder but am ambivalent about the design and durability, especially at this high price point.
B00004ZAVI I have tried numerous supposedly squirrel-proof feeders over the years.  This is a pretty basic design.  The top keeps squirrels from crawling down fro the top (but they can still jump from nearby branches if not carefully placed).  The bottom is on a spring that closes when the weight of a bigger squirrel (grey) lands.  However, some smaller squirrels, like red, or chipmunks are too light to lower the bottom and can access the seed.These kind of feeders usually work well for a year or two, then get knocked down by deer or bear and the top gets chewed by something (probably the grey squirrels).  They do work pretty well until that time.I have had it hanging for nearly 6 months and have had very little bird interest.  I think it is because I primarily use black oil sunflower seed and they just don't come out well from this feeder.  The benefit of this is that squirrels and deer are not able to tip the seed out. The downside is that the birds also have trouble.  My other feeders are filled with birds and empty quickly.  This pretty much just sits there unless the other feeders are emptied.  I could switch to a seed mix, but the majority of that goes uneaten.  Safflower would probably work, but that isn't very popular in my area.I do think it is very hard to fill.  I had to add an s-hook between the feeder and top baffle to be able to hang it easily.  I won't buy another if a bear steals this.
B00004ZAVI We have several bird feeders outside our breakfast window and have had a terrible time with squirrels. Our feeders hang from a pergola-type structure build over the window and the squirrels climb up the sides of it and actually leap onto the feeders. I jumped at the chance to review this Perky-Pet Squirrel proof feeder. I have used Perky Pet products in the past (their hummingbird feeders are the best) and always been pleased with them. This bird feeder, however, has been a disappointment.First, the good news: It appears well constructed and it holds a lot of birdseed. It is fairly simple to put together and hang. I've had the feeder up almost one month now and I can report that yes, it is squirrel-proof. They have not been able to get to it.But now, for the bad news: the birds don't seem to like it either. I filled all 3 of our feeders, this one included, and while the other 2 older feeders were empty within days, this feeder still remains almost full of seeds after almost 4 weeks. I have seen birds perched at it but the feeder just isn't popular with them. I suspect that the openings near the base (where the birds have access to the food) isn't obvious to them and they have to stick their heads inside to actually get to the seed. Perhaps it is just sunflower seeds that don't do well in the feeder. I will plan to try another type of seed and ammend this review if there is a difference.
B00004ZAVI The assembly is easy and the design is good but not perfect as it does not stop small chipmunks getting at it. But this feeder prevents squirrels from feeding on the seeds. I have used this over the past one month and we have few chipmunks in the yard to cause enough trouble at the feeder. When a squirrel jumps at the feeder, the metal dome tilts and wobbles to throw the critter off balance. The weight-activated base also tilts to close off the four feeding ports. The feeder is designed satisfactorily and the metal dome and feeding base is well constructed. The glossy heavy-duty powder coated finish protects the feeder from sun and rain. I have rated three stars for its quality 
B00004ZAVI Right out of the box - it does seem like good quality and looks to be nicely made.  It was easy to assemble, fill and hang.  I have had bird feeders before and even the ones that claim to be squirrel proof were broken into and essentially destroyed by my squirrels. I have it hanging on a shepherds hook and I haven't even seen a squirrel get near it. So far - so good.
B00004ZAVI I immediately found that the quality of this feeder is really good. The metal parts are thick and heavy and have a good coat of gloss paint. It comes almost fully assembled as all you need to do is put the top dome and the inner top cap on. So now for why I feel it needs a 2.0 version. First the clear plastic cylinder that holds the feed has two small drilled holes at the top that the inner cap clicks into with pins. I know that its just a matter of time before the holes start to crack and then split and no longer hold the pins. I think they need to reinforce those hole areas with something (i'll use some duct tape of something myself). The other problem and this may just be an oversight is that there is a nut that you use on the inside to fasten the dome/hook hanging knob. Well, that nut is bigger than the hook/screw and just falls off and doesn't secure the dome at all. I called the company and the telephone number on the instructions insert are wrong so I went to the website to verify. Once I got a person on the phone they were very polite, apologized for the bad part. They had initially told me to return the feeder to Amazon and get a new one since it was brand new. I had to mention that I was doing a review thru the Vine program and she immediately said it would be no problem to send out the one part to fix the issue. I also asked if anyone else had called about this issue and she said she hadn't heard anything but would mention it to the appropriate department.Squirrels are clever critters so i'm constantly changing/rotating out my feeders to try and keep them guessing. Some will still figure out a way, as most jump on it and hit it hard enough to make the seed fall out. Which is what I think will happen on this one but I don't think they can hang from it like a bat and eat from it. It is heavier than most feeders so be aware that it really needs a strong line or what ever you are hooking it on to. I did notice (and this may change in the future) The price is $72.00 on Amazon but on the Perky-Pet website its only $59.00 Its way too expensive for a bird feeder but it is made of good materials and sturdy. For me if it wasn't for the Amazon Vine program to get this, i'd pass on it because of the high price.
B00004ZAVI I own several Perky-Pet brand items and have always loved their products.  I really love EVERYTHING about this squirrel-proof, EXTRA LARGE bird feeder; except for the price.I have 5 other feeders in my fenced-in yard and the birds in my yard flocked to the feeder on the very first day I hung it up.  No clogging, no squirrels, great design and super easy filling are the main things I really like about this feeder. If you don't mind the price, I would urge you to purchase this feeder.  It is undoubtedly my favorite feeder in my yard!Happy Feeding!
B00004ZAVI We have had all sorts of birdfeeders, but I have to say, for some reason the squirrels don't have anything to do with this one. We've tried many squirrel-proof feeders, and well, most of them just aren't squirrel-proof. The squirrels can just take them apart if given enough time.I really can't tell you what it is about this one, but it does seem to work!
B00004ZAVI I hung this feeder in the same spot as another squirrel proof feeder that the squirrels never defeated but never stopped trying to vanquish it either.The squirrel-be-gone feeder is large with it's eventual weight determined by the type and amount of seed used to fill it. Listed capacity is three pounds, but we keep it half full to keep the weight down. Filled to capacity this feeder requires sturdy support.It is easy to assemble the feeder with the only challenging part the piece that hooks into the plastic tube. Filling the tube is no harder than filling any other feeder of this type though I found that using a funnel makes filling much easier and neater. The base and baffle are made of powder coated metal - I'm guessing aluminum because a magnet doesn't stick to it.Most importantly, does it keep the squirrels at bay? So far I'd have to say yes because mostly they don't even try to get into this feeder. Even if they could get past the baffle, the perches are too small for a squirrel to grasp securely. Even the Rodan-sized blackbirds in our yard have a difficult time getting food out of this feeder because the perches are too tiny for them also.A deer had mastered the other squirrel proof feeder and regularly emptied it. I don't think Bambi will be ever to get seed out of this feeder.Yes, I was also taken aback by the listed price for this feeder. Yet, the price has gone down at least five dollars since I first saw it posted, and on the day I'm writing this review it's on sale at the Perky-Pet site for 59 dollars. Those who have spent years battling the squirrels might not mind paying this much for a squirrel-proof feeder that actually works.UPDATE -  I filled the feeder to the top; it holds lots of seed. The next morning the feeder was completely empty. We suspect deer who have previously emptied our other feeders. Will have to monitor the situation.
B00004ZAVI The Perk Pet 397 is almost like the Cadillac of anti Squirrel Technology. The top baffle helps serve to \"baffle\" the enemy, while allowing some birds to maybe stop and perch on the edges... but, if they are too weighty, the baffle will tilt, kicking them off the top. Very few birds I've seen on the feeder have tried landing on the baffle, so it may not work as a perch anyway.Baffles are old hat in the battle against the Squirrel Invading Army, however, so Perky Pet has enlisted even further help. The perch section on the lower portion of the feeder is spring loaded, so that when something too heavy for the feeder touches down, the battle line is closed and the invasion repelled.Unlike the Droll Yankee, THE M1 Abrams in the Squirrel Invasion Prevention Army, is much more expensive than this model. I do not own one, but I can see how someone would want one if they have a bigger squirrel problem than just 2-3 of the little pains. This, of course, in no way justifies the cost of the Perky Pet 397, as $75 is a really expensive feeder. Sure, it works, but you better have a really bad squirrel issue to buy into this one in my opinion.Missing is the ability to adjust the sensitivity of the perch latch, though I've seen a few cardinals on ours, so I assume such birds wont be an issue and will still be able to feed.The feeder is easy to assemble and easy to fill. One thing to note, if you plan to fill this to capacity, ensure wherever you are hanging it has the ability to withstand the heavy load. This thing holds a lot of seed.Overall, I'm happy with the feeder and its squirrel thwarting capabilities. Where I struggle is the price. For $50 you can buy 2 baffles, one for above and one for below a regular feeder. Unless you give the little suckers a place to hang out between the 2 baffles, you pretty much succeed with squirrel immunity. If you want an all in one solution, have the ability to hang this with a full load of seed and just want to hang it and forget it, this is definitely not a bad solution to the Squirrel Invasion.
B00004ZAVI This is a nicely made feeder, easy to assemble, fill with seed and hang.  I have had it up for about a week and so far no squirrells have  been able to get to the  food!  I have it hanging from a shepards hook  that  is cemented into the ground! The birds have had no issues that prevented or made it difficult for them to eat at the feeder.While it is nicely made, easy to assemble etc. it is in no way worth $72!!!  I can't imagine anyone paying that kind of money for a bird feeder that is suppose to keep squirrels out of it.
B00004ZAVI We haven't had a bit of problems with squirrels, chipmunks or other pesky thieves stealing birdseed since I put the Perky-Pet Squirrel-Be Gone IV feeder out. At first I tried regular birdseed, but the birds didn't seem to care for it. They couldn't (or maybe just wouldn't) dig through the mix of seeds to find their favorites. After seeing the seed level not going down, I decided to swap out the seed for black oil sunflower seeds. The only birds to use it (and still very sparingly) are the goldfinches. Everything here still prefers the other feeders and will pretty much ignore this even when the other feeders stood empty for a few days.The feeder design itself is really interesting. It is large and holds a nice amount of seed (up to 3 pounds!), so you are not filling all the time. The cover is not attached to the feeder, but instead the feeder hooks to it, allowing the cover to wiggle and not let any creatures to sit comfortably on the top. The perches are attached to a free moving base that will tip and close off the food so any unwanted visitors cannot get to the food.This feeder really seems to work well, but my birds don't seem to like it. Maybe this winter will be different as food becomes more scarce.
B00004ZAVI Issues with the feeder:-the nut that is to secure the top hook to the cover is tiny in size and ill fitted to the size of the hook.  It was impossible to secure it, and thus the top wobbles a bit.-tube plastic, part holding the seeds, is a bit thin.  It has to be squeezed slightly in order for the 2 prongs that hold the top on to be inserted, which gives me concern it will not hold up well in windy conditions.-seeds (1/4 to 1/2 cup) fall out of the bottom when filling the container and/or anytime the feeder is set on a solid surface.-bottom portion wiggles around the tube, seems way to loose, maybe that is why so many seeds fall out.-It does hold a lot of seeds, but the rather flimsy construction and materials gives me pause for concern. Especially considering the entire thing is held together by 2 tiny prongs, one in each side of the tube top.observation:-only very small birds have room to land on the tiny perches-the holes to feed from are very small, and there is a gap between the opening and where the seeds actually are, so again, only a small bird head will fit inside the hole to reach the seeds.Opinion:For the price, currently $73 on Amazon, there are better, more sturdy options. I have and currently use several cheaper and better feeders than this one.**Edit Oct 3, 2013 -- So after only a few weeks, I had to take down the feeder as the bottom was falling out.  And changing the rating from 2 stars to 1.
B00004ZAVI Simple assembly (two minutes worth) is required for this feeder.  The tube has two holes in the top into which you insert the  metal prongs on the roof (you cannot see this in the stock photos, as it is covered by the squirrel dome).  I have uploaded a photo of the top. The roof has a 2 inch  opening for seed and a bar across it, so that the baffle part can hook onto it.  To fill you have two choices, remove the top by slightly squeezing the plastic,  the plastic is flexible enough for this, but I am not sure if that is what it was designed for and am afraid that squeezing it may stress it.  Or you can try to pour the seed through the opening, which is not easy because the bar across the top tends to deflect the seed.  I really do not like this, especially because the tube itself tends to move around when you set it down due the spring loaded bottom designed to keep squirrels out.We have Abert squirrels (darling but clever things that look like koalas).  They are acrobatic and determined.  They do not seem to be able to access the feeder after a few days (and they usually do get into them quickly) but it remains to be seen if they will learn.  Birds do not seem to have a problem.This feeder is not worth the current price over seventy dollars.  The metal parts are a lot nicer than most birdfeeders, and the bottom works well but I feel that the design of the top is really lacking.  I am concerned about all the weight on the small prongs that stick out and filling it is a pain. The plastic part is also not much better than my 20 dollar feeder.  Filling it so annoying, that I cannot recommend it at all.  I have a couple of the Perky Pet 102 Squirrel Resistant feeders, (you can get three of those, with some money left over for the price of this one) that have multiple ports (which birds like) and which are MUCH easier to fill.  Squirrels can get a bit of food from them, but they do have to work a bit for it.  Try one of those first if squirrels are a pest.  I am going to use the baffle (which is very nice powder coated metal) for my one of my other Perky Pet feeders.  If the baffle were sold separately, I would buy some more of those.
B00004ZAVI I let the feeder hang for about a week under 4 different trees.I would purposely put some bird feed on the ground in hopes that they would eat it and then move up to use the feeder.For some reason I never could entice them to try it.Even squirrels climbing neighboring trees and the tree it was hanging from ignored it.The design seems to make sense but I think the main problem is the way the little metal perches are sticking out instead of being in front of the seed dispensor like a more traditional feeder.Maybe when the ground is covered in snow it would draw birds to it.Or maybe in the spring when birds are busy making a nest they would try the easy supply of food.But here in the late summer/early fall they just avoided trying it.
B00004ZAW4 All of the reviews criticizing the design are correct. The link between the bottle and the suction cup assembly is fatally flawed. On the feeder I received, the glass blob and the runners on the suction cup frame fit together so tightly that there's no way to get the feeder off the frame when it's stuck to a window. Once it's on the window you have to wrestle the entire assembly off to refill, and then go through the tortuous process of remounting the suction cups. Good news/bad news - the feeder is so cheap that it's not worth paying the postage to send it back. Despite the much higher cost, I think the only maker of hummingbird feeders worth buying is Aspects.
B00004ZAW4 It took a while for my hummingbirds to get used to the new feeder before they started sitting instead of feeding while hoovering. Once they figured this out, it is their favorite feeder.
B00004ZAW4 I wanted a glass hummingbird feeder and decided to try this one on my window before springing for some of the more glamorous-looking blown glass ones. I mounted it on my kitchen window, under an awning on the northeast side of the house, not at all expecting anything to happen. A ruby-throated hummingbird found it the very first day!It took some force at first to separate the mounting bracket thing from the feeder itself. In fact, I had to drop it first for it to break loose and detach! Fortunately, nothing broke. I probably could have just soaked it in some hot soapy water and it would have come apart easily.You can't beat glass. I'm just totally getting away from plastic these days....
B00004ZAW4 This is one of my favorite feeders, because it's right there in front of your nose! Hummingbirds are very fast. I've gone entire years only seeing one sighting that year because I wasn't sitting by the feeder when they happened to come by. By sticking the feeder where it is always visible, that little movement will catch your eye, and you'll probably see them daily! I know I do!Because it's made of glass, and not plastic like the normal seed-feeders, it is on the heavy side and needs to be attached securely. I read some reviews where people had trouble connecting it. I found it quite easy, just clean the glass, oil the cups a bit and press. It's stayed up for years without any problem.I also read some reviews where people said they had trouble filling it. Just about EVERY hummingbird feeder I have has a small exit area - otherwise the nectar wouldn't come out slowly! A funnel is 39 cents and makes filling *very* easy.I have 10+ hummingbird feeders and this is by far the best for consistant hummingbird viewing.
B00004ZAW4 I too had trouble at first and gave this feeder a bad review but after fully reading the directions the brackett with suction cups separates from the bottle . I suggest you clean the window fully , which I did and it has never come down , been up for at least a month. When you refill hold the brackett in place with one hand and slide the bottle up and off with the other. It also does not leak. Since the brackett separates from the bottle it is very easy to apply suction cups to window. Forget all that about rubbing the suction cups with friction to make it stick.
B00004ZAW4 The window feeder is an awesome feeder and it is actually the most visited feeder that I have.I'm sure it's the location more than not but also the feeding ports are easily accessible to the rubythroated hummingbird..Please be aware though that ants will eventually find it.  With this in mind, be hesitant to remove that spider web on your window sill.  Spiders are nature pest control.
B00004ZB4K I ordered these little brushes to clean my hummingbird feeder, but you would be amazed at how useful they are around the kitchen and around the house. They fit into orifices and crevices when nothing else will.
B00004ZB4K It would be even nicer if they were packaged in different lengths and sizes (or at least one had a longer handle).
B00004ZB4K Actually, the name of this product describes them perfectly &#8211; &#8220;Perfect Little Brush.&#8221;  I actually have three sets of these. I had originally purchased them specifically for cleaning our hummingbird feeders but found that they are extremely useful for so many different things.I use them to clean small kitchen appliances, detailing our cars, cleaning power tools and cleaning fishing reels and my target pistols.  They work quite well in any small and hard to get at area.  They are stout enough to get the job done, yet they are gentle enough to not damage the thing you are cleaning.If you have hummingbird feeders then these, or something like them, is almost a must.  Feeders need to be kept extremely clean and need to be cleaned often.  These perfect little brushes make our lives so much easier.  We have, at times, up to 12 feeders going and cleaning them is a major chore.The price here is very competitive to what we paid here locally...IF you have Amazon Prime and get the free shipping.  If you have to pay shipping you might want to see if you can purchase the locally.  We buy ours at a local wild bird store. Although I will say that if you keep any eye on these brushes here on Amazon you will find that the price changes quite often.All in all this is a great product and I do highly recommend it.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks
B00004ZB4K This set of three, multi-colored bottle brushes is perfect for cleaning hummingbird feeder ports and other small holes and places.  For example, I have reserved one to clean out the small spouts in my fountain which tend to clog with algae as the summer wears on.  Each brush is about 3.5 inches long, with a tapered head that begins at 1/8 inch and widens at the base to 1/4 inch.  The brushes can crush down to a much more narrow diameter than that, of course -- the width of the wires that hold the brushes, less than 1/16 of an inch.  The plastic handles are rigid, although they can accidentally be snapped in two with pressure.  The wired support of the brushes themselves is only slightly flexible; you won't be able to work these brushes around corners and inside the base of a feeder bottle.These are basically short, rigid, reusable pipe cleaners.  They are perfect for cleaning hummingbird feeder ports or any other job requiring those qualities.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann
B00004ZB4K These brushes really do get in the ports for cleaning hummingbird feeders. I suspect the hummingbirds appreciate all the works I do for them - they come here year 'round but I wish they would tell their friends.
B00004ZB4K I am a bit reluctant to give these brushes five stars because they are priced as if they are gold plated. However, I am rating them strictly on their use and that does earn a five star rating. They fit perfectly into the openings in my hummingbird feeders and do the job well for which they are intended. Having three different colors is a handy feature for balancing out the use. A fine, if overpriced, product.
B00004ZB4K This is a very well made brush that is good for feeder ports, especially hummingbird feeders.  So far for me it's been tough enough that after several uses its still holding its shape, and without shedding.  I like it and feel it is well worth the price here on Amazon, (especially with the free shipping that is being offered at the time of this writing).  The only thing I feel I should make extra note of is its really small size.  It's only 3 1/2\" long, which makes it kinda useless for anything but ports on feeders.  If you want to get down to the bottom of a tube feeder where it really gets nasty over time, you will need to pick up a long bottle brush.  Also, if you do buy this brush for use on feeder ports, I would toss the suggestion of keeping it around your sink for other uses that's mentioned in the description.  You will be bringing in all kinds of bacteria from dirty feeders into your kitchen.  You can wash it well of course, but it's still a better idea to either keep one of these strictly for other uses than feeders, or buy some other brush for your kitchen sink.  Recommended for its quality and price.. : )
B00004ZB4K Bought these to clean the feeder ports on my hummingbird feeders and they work perfectly!  Great product!  You won't be disappointed with these
B00004ZB4K I took these and cleaned my old hummingbird feeder and boy are they great to use. Will keep the mold off the sip holes and that will be a blessing for all.
B00004ZB4K These are much smaller than I expected, I did not read the description well, I guess.  But I love them anyway they are perfect for getting into the little tiny holes of the hummingbird feeder to clean them well.  I was using a pipe cleaner before, but these are reusable, so they are perfect for the job!
B00004ZB4K I bought these to clean my hummingbird feeder. I didn't realize they were so short! They are really only good for cleaning out the flower part, but not the glass part of the feeder.
B000053F9J I found mine doesn't droop, and it has a good lighting area. I'm using it for seedlings after they germinate. I'm very happy with it.
B000053F9J This is the best one i could find on Amazon for a reasonable price. I love that it came with the bulb and clamp!
B000053F9J I bought this to provide supplemental light to my Bonsai and it works perfect for what I needed. The clamp is very strong and the fixture easily clips on securely and holds the light in place. Other reviewers have mentioned the light gets hot. I disagree a bit, the light does get fairly warm but not too hot. I have the light 13&#34; from my Bonsai plant and the warmth is hardly felt. The housing for the bulb gets the hottest but I really do not think it is much of an issue for me. I would not place the light near a curtain or blinds but I would not say it gets overly hot.+ Warm Color Light, Not Bright White Like Florescent bulbs+ Very Strong Clamp+ On/Off Switch+ Rotates/Twists/Adjusts to Many Positions+ Easily Replace Bulb+ Price+ Great Supplemental Light Source- Would be nice if the On/Off switch were on the cord not the housing_Bottom Line_ Yes, I would recommend this light to a friend. The further away the light is placed, the wider the angle of light allowing for multiple plants under the light. I have several plants under it and they are all doing very well. I just put two screws into a stud on the wall and then hooked the clamp to the screws. I am very confident the light is secure. I like that if/when the bulb goes out I can buy the same bulb or try something else.
B000053F9J This little light is easy to assemble, needing not much more than a screw driver to tighten the nut and screw. Once it is clamped down on another sturdy object, it stays put.  It doesn't wobble or come undone.  The cord is five feet long.  Depending on how far away this lamp is from the plant, the effective radius is plenty enough (about 24\" from a foot away).  I use this over a germination set next to my bird cage, and my little dove gets some of that light as well.One thing about this that may be dangerous to other users:  the black hood that goes around the socket gets VERY HOT!  This lamp would not be recommended around birds or small children.  However, set in a nice location this is a pretty lamp that provides good swivvel and warmth.This clamp comes with a 60-watt bulb, packed in its separate cardboard support.
B000053F9J I hope to remember to follow up in the spring as to how my herbs wintered, but I am very happy with how these lights set up.This is the first year I am trying to keep herbs growing, indoors, through the winter...in northwest MT.  I do have a room with fairly large south facing windows but at 48North, there is not enough sunlight and not good intensity to keep much going without supplemental light.I bought two lights and they easily and securely clamped on to a window valance (bamboo).  Not only do they give the plants good light (I hope!) but they create a nice ambiance in the room which is also my office (self employed computer programmer).I had thought to buy a light bar and stand - actually 2 - and make some shelf tables, but the other item in my personal mix is that I often travel by motorhome - and I travel through the winter.  These lights will easily go along and allow me to take my little herb garden along.  The light bar/stand options would not have worked for travel.It is a not very expensive experiment.  I love to have fresh herbs.  Based on other's reviews, I have very high hopes.
B000053F9J This arrived on the 19th and I started using it the last week of Feb. It is now March 4th and it has stopped working. No, it is not the light bulb, I changing it  a few times and still nada. So about 7 - 10 days use and it is broken already. Total waste of money.
B00005850M This method is must easier than boiling water and waiting for sugar to dissolve. Our hummingbirds didnt seem to notice when we switched.
B00005850M I love the powder nectar. Easy to prepare. Good buy online, prompt delivery! Left over nectar keeps great in fridge and ready to use.
B00005850M The only thing in this that should be there is sugar. The rest is stuff you shouldn't be adding to your feathered friends diet. This stuff is also three times the price of baker's sugar from any old grocery store, four times the price of regular granulated sugar that takes a little longer to dissolve. This is a bad buy, bad for the birds and bad for your pocket.
B00005850M I picked up some of this  mix last summer at a local agricultural center.  It's an old brand that is easy to find, and the price was right.  My first outing with it last summer was a total bust.  I mean I mixed the stuff, put it out in two nice clean feeders and saw nothing get attracted to it but ants and bees.  If any hummingbirds did bother to stop by and sample it, they were obviously disappointed for they never came back.  Personally I never eyed a single one hovering over it.  At first I thought that I may have gotten started with feeding them too late. I live in New England where we only get one species of hummer that comes this far north, (the ruby throated).  It's important to get your feeders up in early spring and then they will find it and remain loyal to you.  But this spring I was johnny on the spot with the feeders and the same no show was going on.  I decided to try another brand of mix after this last outing.  (I know you can make it at home easier and cheaper, but just not worth the mess and trouble to me. Just my opinion, but its stands).  I decided to try the Mills Brothers nectar after reading the positive reviews for it here on Amazon.  Within just a week of flushing the old feeders and putting in the Mills brand, I had two dedicated hummers dining regularly at my troth.  I love it. It's definitely a little pricier than this mix, but well worth it, trust me.  I don't really know if any other brand or home made mix would do the same trick as the Mills, but I don't really care.  I found something that's reasonably priced, easy to use, and the hummers love it so I am sticking with it.  In conclusion, I don't bother to get involved in the debate about this Perky Pet stuff being junk food or bad for the hummers.  Personally I think that a lot of folks get a little too excited and go overboard with the panic over additives and colorings etc.  My main disappointment and concern with this stuff is strictly limited to the hummers not liking it.  It may have something to do with my dismal results being that I am forced to only deal with one species of hummer here, but the end result is that this Perky Pet mix has been a complete failure for me, and the Mills Brothers a hit even this early on in the season. I have left a link to the Mills brand, and my recommendation is that you skip this stuff and go for what seems to really work...Mills Brothers Hummingbird Food 3-Ounce Packet, 3-Pack
B00005850M There is no reason for the manufacturer to put red food coloring into this mix. There are numerous concerns about the effect on hummingbirds.  This is reason enough to not buy this product.  Buy a product without the dye.Better yet, just buy sugar.  Use 4 parts water and 1 part sugar.  Boil the water first and then add the sugar until dissolved.  You will save money and perhaps a hummingbird's life doing this versus buying dye tainted food.  Hummingbird food is only sugar with coloring.CAUTION.  DO NOT use artificial sweeteners or honey, use only sugar.  Honey and sugar substitutes will malnourish and quickly kill hummingbirds.  Sugar Only!
B00005850M Hummingbirds are wonderful.  They're amazing, unique birds, but you don't need to buy anything expensive to draw them to your yard.If you want a feeder, try this one:Perky-Pet Glass 8-Ounce Hummingbird Feederor something similar.  I've used this type for years and you can't beat the fact that it's glass, and that you can buy new bee guards.  (They get moldy.  Don't bleach...replace.You can get a good feeder for about ten bucks and it will last for years.As far as food, you can do two things.  Plant plants that hummers and butterflies and bees like; or buy a gallon of distilled water and some quality sugar.  You don't need red dye, and shouldn't use it.  It's bad for the Hummers.I was going to send a Feeder to my nieces, and when I looked at this product I was appalled to find that Perky Pet is still producing such a formula.  Their bad.It's cheap to have hummingbirds.  And easy to make your own hummer-chow.  Don't buy this.
B00005850M We recently purchased a new-to-us home in a nicely wooded area. Within a few weeks of moving in, we realized that there were more than a few hummingbirds around... about that same time, we came across unused (new-in-box) feeders while helping my mother clean her garage. This all seemed like the making of a fun hobby, and we have not been disappointed.one of them was a Perky Pet 8 ounce feeder (Perky-Pet 203CP Pinch Waist Glass 8-Ounce Hummingbird Feeder) and the boxed set she she came with one packet of this nectar, which we found to be easy to prepare (very nice, since we really only have a couple minutes to get-it-done as we head out to work early morning).We cleaned the dust off the feeders, loaded them with nectar... and then nothing really happened for the first few days.  Just as we began to feel a bit of disappointment, we were encouraged when we noticed that the fluid level dropped a bit.Following directions, we emptied and cleaned the feeder at week's end and then refilled it -- and that is when the nectar carnage really started! As week #2 of our feeder experience really got underway, the feeders emptied in about four days and we began to see hummingbirds coming and going at all times of the day. Guess the word got out!By the middle of the fourth week, the 16 ounce feeder was emptying every 2.5 days or so and the 8 ounce feeder in a day or two. We had wonderfully colored green, yellow, blue and kinda magenta hummingbirds flying around in singles and in pairs, and they are awesome to watch. They love this nectar, flying in to land on the feeder's perch and sipping until content, then buzzing right off. There were even times when hummers seemed to do a little battle for prime sitting position, with the 'winner' forcing the other one(s) to hover just a few inches away (im)patiently waiting for their tuns. Very interesting and beautiful to watch.It's November and night-time temperatures are dipping below freezing, and our hummingbirds seem to have migrated away now. Can't wait to get the feeders and nectar back out in the Spring and watch them frolic again.Highly recommended! Totally fascinating.
B00005850M This nectar is easy to mix and left overs can be refrigerated. Since I went back to the instant versus the pre-mixed; I've gotten my hummingbirds back. :)
B00005850M This product is very easy to mix.  There have been some hummingbirds using it, yes we do have hummingbirds in the winter.
B00005850M I love Perky-Pet feeders, but they should be ashamed of themselves for selling this. They do not need artificial anything, especially food coloring! All you need to do is bring 4 parts water to a boil, and 1 part white sugar, let boil a couple of minutes and let it cool. If you are too lazy to do this, you shouldn't be feeding hummers. It only takes a few minutes, and you can make more and store it in the fridge for up to 2 weeks. Hummingbirds also get their nutrition from real flower nectar, and small insects.
B00005850M Besides Hummingbirds:this nectar &#34;with NATURAL sweeteners&#34; mix will also draw a variety of birds;nectar feeding birds along with a few seed eating birds + it's quick & simple to prepare.One 2 LB box contains 6 pre measured packets / makes 6 quarts of nectar.As with other nectar:the nectar feeders need to be refilled OFTEN;especially before the birds have plenty of insects to feed on..Part of many nectar feeding birds diet also includes insects.
B000059MT3 This is like a Tornado in your hands. Has 3 settings : Off , 1 and 2.1 is pretty powerful and can even move small rocks. 2 clears everything out of the way. Haven't tried it for the vacuum yet but that's not why i got it.
B000059MT3 I honestly believe that this is the best, most powerful leaf blower for the money. I mean, come on...under $60.00. The Toro name. Great power. Lightweight. Easy to handle. What else would you want? OK...so some people will be put off by the fact that it's electric. Big deal. Get yourself an extension cord. I have a lot that's 150 feet deep and it's no problem maneuvering this thing with a cord attached to it. As far as noise goes, this this is a bit noisy...but it's a leaf blower!!! What are you expecting? Silence? The nice thing about the noise is that it's more of a low roar instead of a high-pitched whining sound like my neighbor's blower (which drives my wife and me crazy). Now...about the vac feature. If you're looking for a heavy duty leaf vac/shredder, this ain't it. It does have a plastic impeller and you have to be careful not to suck up any rocks or thick sticks. In fact, this is my second one of these blowers. I had the first one for three years and had no problems with either the blower or vac part. Then my 10-year-old decided to see if it was powerful enough to suck up a small rock from the garden. Indeed, it was. But the rock broke the plastic impeller, and that was the end of it (man...what a horrible sound THAT made!). But is should show you something that I went right to Amazon and ordered the exact same blower to replace it. I may use this one mostly as a blower. I'll use the vac, but only to suck up stray leaves on the driveway and in hard to reach places. I honestly believe if you're looking to vac up big piles of leaves, a much more heavy duty piece of equipment is in order. But if you're looking for an excellent blower at an excellent price, which will do minor vacuuming of leaves, this unit is perfect. You really can't beat the price. At under $60.00, I don't think you'll find a better made, more powerful, well-built unit. This thing really blows!!!!
B000059MT3 Here's some opinions I have after using this blower for a couple of weeks now.1. The vacuum bag is hard to take off. I seen in another comment that, do not to slip in in all the way. Haven't tried that yet2. The On/Off knob. Sometimes I found I bumped into it with my hand causing it to move it's position.3. I found it easier to let the bag lay on the ground instead of using the strap around the shoulder when vacuuming leaves.4. The Magnesium Impeller will fit on this unit. I ordered and installed the Magnesium Impeller from Toro model 51598. (thanks to Allen who commented about that in his review)5. Would be nice if it had one more lower setting on the blower6. It's very light and has plenty of power
B000059MT3 Received this Toro for Father's Day and I love it. Sweeping and raking are two of my least favorite yard chores, and this unit has instantly become one of my indispensible tools. Although I was able to vacuum up green hedge trimmings w/o any real problem, I went ahead and ordered the replacement impeller from the heavy duty Ultra model (they are interchangeable), for an additional $30. I was going to mount it right away, but now have decided to run the plastic one until it breaks or wears, then switch to the magnesium one. It makes sense to do this, as the magnesium impeller is very light, yet this Super unit is 4 lbs less than the Ultra, which helps at the end of the day.
B000059MT3 Let me keep this short and simple- this sucker blows like a hurricane!  It's much more powerful than others I have used.  The speed adjustment is handily located.  And while I'd never call it \"quiet\", it's not as loud as less powerful blowers I have owned.  I can't comment on the vacuum function as I've never used it.
B00005AKZE I use this for a very small lawn.  It starts like a breeze and cuts well.  It has plenty of power.  I got used to dragging the cord pretty easily and that is well worth the trade off for ease of use.  The main draw-back is that the handle is wider than the mower so prevents Getty close enough to fences, etc.
B00005AKZE This Black and Decker has worked well in my father's tiny 25' x 80' yard, but I wouldn't want to use it for a larger area. Here are my observations:Pro -+ Easy to Use; just plug it in and go+ Quiet; can use it anytime day or night without disturbing the neighbors+ Lightweight; my elderly father had no trouble using this when he wanted to, but my son also was able to help outCons -- No Cord Included; you need to provide your own heavy duty extension cord- Watch the Cord While Cutting; like using a vacuum cleaner, you need to be mindful of the cord so you don't accidentally run it over (I recommended the bright orange color ones that are easy to see against the green grass)Overall, we are very happy with this for use on a small yard.Highly Recommended!CFH
B00005AKZE After using a heavy metal mower for years, this was a blast of fresh, light air. You can mow one-handed and wrangle the cord with your other hand....HOWEVER, we have officially just broken 2 of them. The first one was killed when the blade hit the protruding metal sewage pipe in our yard. The second one just broke now when I set the blade too low and hit an old tree root under grass. The blade got bend, and may be replaceable if the main stem is also bent. I also hit a rock a few weeks ago and almost broke it then, too...Best for even yards without anything that can bend the blade. The cord is a total pain to wrangle and keep from going into the blade...May consider a rechargeable battery model next....
B00005AKZE I have had this mower for five seasons so far, during which I typically have to mow twice per week from March through October or even November.  In other words, this mower has seen lots of use, and it hasn't failed me.There are several reasons I love this mower:1)  I am allergic to gasoline, so I avoid using it as much as possible.  Therefore, it is extraordinarily helpful to have an electric mower that allows me to avoid yard-based gasoline-guzzling &#34;appliances&#34; completely.2) It is light-weight, so I can handle it on my own.3) The handle easily folds down so it takes up less room in storage during the winter,4) Because it is electric, I can flip it upside down to clean it out without worrying about spilling any toxic chemicals.5) It does a very good job cutting grass!  This is important in a mower!  It also does a good job mulching grass clippings.6) It can handle hills without any issue.7) It is easy to adjust the cutting height.  In fact, the cutting height can be adjusted with one hand, by moving the handl on the left side of the mower.8) It is QUIET!  This mower emits less than half the noise polution that a typical mower emits.  I could probably mow very early in the morning and not annoy my neighbors too much. :)9) It doesn't pollute the air the way gas-powered mowers do.10) It is easy to start, with no pulling, keys, or other obstacles.  Just plug this baby in, pull up on the little orange handle (on the main handle), and mow.  That's it!Using a cord can be annoying at times, but it is something to which I QUICKLY became accustomed, and I quickly set up my &#34;ballet routine&#34; of mowing while avoiding the cord.  It isn't that bad. :)
B00005AKZE I feel like I am vacuuming my lawn instead of cutting it, and the cord gets quite annoying to constantly move out of the way.  But as far as quality, cost (no gas) and quick startup, it's very good.  I would recommend if you can get past the cord getting in the way all the time....it definitely took me probably twice as long to cut the grass than it normally would with a gas mower just because of having to move the cord over and over again.  But it cut well, was very quiet.
B00005AKZE This is my first electric lawnmower, and so far, I absolutely love it.  It is smaller, quieter, lighter, cleaner, and more efficient than your typical gas mower, and there is no risk of throwing out your back trying to start it.  It is one of my best buys at Amazon.The mower was shipped in the original box, with the housing nicely supported by cardboard inserts to protect, and minimize vibration.  Remarkably, a single strip of clear tape held the cover down.  The mower is relatively easy to assemble, and does not require any hand tools.  The instruction manual is pretty thorough, except for a couple of parts related to assembly, where a little better description, and larger diagrams would help.  Although it is stated in the manual that `no lubrication is necessary', lubricating the bolts on the handle before assembly, and even finished metal parts like the handle, will help deter corrosion.  The springs in the power handle and grass guard, would also benefit from spray lubricant.Once assembled, the mower is ready for immediate use.  Favoring the right-handed majority, the power switch is on the right side.  The motor starts up smoothly, and is relatively quiet, even when running at full power.  The whooshing sound generated, probably isn't much louder than a large electric weedwacker.  Since the motor is near the ground, and enclosed by a green plastic cover, the sound doesn't carry too much.  Motor speed can be controlled using the throttle lever, though the mower is designed to be run at full throttle most of the time.The blade height is set using a lever located at the left rear wheel, and is adjustable in approximately half inch increments, from about one inch, to three and a half inches.  The motor on this mower is probably not strong enough to cut a heavy lawn with grass higher than say three inches down to the one inch level, without stalling.  Running a motor with the rotor locked, is not a good thing, so avoid trying to force your way through tough spots.  Cutting narrower strips of lawn is one option.  Or you may need to start with the blade at a higher level, and then drop it down to one inch on the second pass.  If there are just a few high spots, the old technique of raising the front of the mower, and cutting them down, and then going over the area again, might do the trick.  It sounds like a lot of work, but consider that an electric mower is much lighter and easier to maneuver.Grass will collect at the discharge area.  The spring-loaded plastic deflector has some deep depressions that get clogged with grass.  If you don't clean the area out it could promote corrosion of the spring.  There is a gap between the green plastic outer cover and the metal framing that also gets filled with grass.  Perhaps a hard rubber seal in this gap, would be a good idea.  In general, the design of this area could be improved.There is a plastic strip at the back of the mower to help block debris that might blow backwards.  It is quite soft and flexible, and because it is quite close to the ground, it gets bent around and scraped up.  Possibly if it were made of harder plastic, and raised up a bit, it may last longer.  The wheels look quite sturdy and durable, and according to the manual, the wheels require no lubrication.Besides the normal safety concerns when using any lawn mower, users of a cord and plug electric mower, need to develop an awareness of, and a system for handling, the power cord.  Avoiding any possibility of overrunning the cord should be a primary concern.  What is recommended is if possible, mowing outwards from the source of power.  That way, you can try and minimize the chances of crossing over the cord while mowing.  Running the cord over my right shoulder, keeps it from trailing directly on the ground, and helps me keep track of where the cord is.  The mower has provisions for attaching the cord, and when connected properly, there is almost no chance that the cord will become detached.If you have a very large lawn, or one with heavy thick grass, this mower may not have enough power, and you may need to look at one of Black and Decker's other electrics with more powerful motors.  This machine has no problems handling my 2000 square feet of lawn, and I am very pleased with my purchase.  Easily five stars for this baby.
B00005AKZI I bought this product back in 2004, replacing an older gas mower after my neighors house caught fire from a leaking gas can in his garage. Used the electric mower until 2007, when I treated myself to a mow/blow/go gardner. I just stuck the machine out in the side yard and never touched it. In July 2008, I pulled it out to mow a newly planted lawn not covered by my mow/go guy. Plugged it in, and it started right away, try that with a gas mower. My new house has 2300 sf of front and back lawn, this mower just gobbles up that lawn. It does bog down in taller/thicker patches, hence only 4 stars. But it gives a nice clean cut. Changing the blade was easy. And it does a nice job of mulching, my lawns look great. I will never own a gas mower!
B00005AKZI This is truly a good mower. I bought my first Black & Decker electric mower in 1972 and used it as my only mower until 1994. It received normal use on a normal sized subdivision lot. I absolutely loved it.Then, I moved to places that had much more land and the use of such was impossible. For the last few years, I've lived where there is a combination of riding mower and walk-behind needed. My gasoline walk-behind developed problems that were going to cost more to fix than it was worth. So, I bought this one.It took just a few minutes to get the mower assembled and the handle adjusted. I sprayed the underside with vegetable oil and started using it. It works great. It is heavy enough to not bounce around on uneven ground, but is light enough to let an old man with back and leg problems to push it around.This has the same problem as the Black & Decker corded tiller - the cheap plastic flip-our power switch and the worthless (and unusable) cord minder. Using a 12-3 cord is necessary for the distance I have to go with this and it just won't fit into the mower as designed. It also requires holding onto the mower with your right hand 100% of the time, regardless of the direction being mowed and where the cord is. I'm working on plans to modify the whole switch/cord thing. What a shame that this needs done.Yes, this is still a 5 star mower. The height adjustment is very easily used. There is ample power. The grass catcher works well, as does the mulching feature. It is a snap to keep clean. And, again, the weight is just right. I really, really like this. It seems that they assigned the mower development to people who knew what they were doing and the switch/cord development to someone who had never used an electric lawn tool.
B00005AKZI This mower hit a small rock on its first mission and that enough to break the unit and send it to the dump.
B00005AKZI Moving to a smaller property back in 2003, I found myself no longer needing my riding mower. I looked at several options in the gas mower lineup. After talking to a couple of electric mower owners in my neighborhood, I went shopping at the local hardware store and brought home the earlier version of the Black & Decker MM875 Mower. Like other gas powered tool owners at that time, I seriously had my doubts. That changed after a few weeks use. I'm very surprised that after eight years, this mower is still up and running.Weighing in at 52 lbs, this 12 amp mower cuts a 19\" path in no time. With adjustable wheel heights ranging from 1.4\" to about 3.5\", it does a nice job. I like the one touch feature for wheel height adjustment. There's no fuss and tightness to contend with. I don't miss the noise of a gas powered motor. Unlike the newer version, my mower has a straight handle bar with a comfortable grip. The start handle is conveniently located on the right side and has a good feel to it. Other then that, there's really not that much of a change from the original.This mower is light and easy to maneuver around bushes and trees.  It does an average job of mulching. Mine came with the side discharge chute. The rear bag that now comes with the newer units was an optional purchase back in 2003. Even though I don't use it much, the folding handle is a nice add on for owners with tight spaces. As far as power cords go, I picked up a good 100 foot length 14/3 gauge outdoor extension cord. Its not that hard to manage the extension cord. When using any power tool, its all about staying alert.Like any piece of gear, proper maintenance is paramount. Prior to using this or any mower, its a good idea to coat the undercarriage with a non stick spray. I use the generic grilling spray on mine. I give the blades a good coating too. Since the body isn't metal, I use a rubber spatula to remove any buildup. Afterwards, a good wipe down. Its a good idea to inspect the bolts, nuts and screws for tightness after each use. Just like gas powered mowers, it does take a little bit of effort to remove and replace or sharpen the blade. I always sharpen my blade before the start of the mowing season and every other month. When sharpening the blade I use a fine tooth file. It can be sharpened with a good stone too. I got about 5 years out of one blade.Besides replacing the blade the back flap needed some help too. The original flap lasted me about 7 years and wasn't that difficult to remove and replace. Protection wise, Black & Decker offers a two year limited warranty on the mower and a lifetime package on the mower deck. I've not used their toll free customer support number for the mower, but I have for other Black & Decker products. The customer service that I did receive was outstanding.Overall, I am very satisfied with my Black & Decker mower. It has been a reliable lawn tool that quietly and efficiently gets the job done. With proper maintenance I expect to get another eight more years out of this one. In closing, I can honestly say that I don't miss my old gas mowers one bit.
B00005AKZI This mower works great with small lawns that have minimal obstructions between the electric outlet and the desired mowing area.  The only way they could make this mower better is if it was push assisted.
B00005AKZI I've had this mower now for 3 seasons. And every time I fire it up, I recall the days of having to maintain an internal combustion engine. You don't have to change oil. You don't have to check spark plugs. You don't have to run the mower dry for over wintering. The only real maintenance we've had done is to sharpen the blades, and we did that last year with no fuss. That's it. Maintenance is blade sharpening. This saves me time and effort.Then there is the quality of life change as well. No more stinky clothes or hair from spent gasoline. No more deafening roar when I run the engine. Yes, the engine makes noise, but this electric mower must be an order of magnitude quieter. My fiance doesn't have to yell at me while mowing if she needs my attention, just speak in a louder voice.The mower is LIGHT. Sure, 50 lbs is unwieldy if you are carrying a package or something, but pushing 50 lbs around your yard? LIGHT.And then there is the one touch, single point height adjustment. Holy COW, this is just fantastic! Gone are the days where you have to adjust horrible levers, one per wheel, to get the proper height. Sure, newer mowers offer this capability and aren't corded, but coming from one that had 4 wheel painful adjustment, this is a dream come true.There are downsides to this mower. One is power. 12 amps has been enough, for the most part, to mow our lawn. In deep (5\") and wet grass, it starts strong but if you don't slow down, the engine will work itself to a stall of sorts. This is NO different than what we had with the electric mower though. I can't believe just how much power this thing really does have.Another problem is the power cord. First, make sure your house has an external power plug, otherwise you'll have to fish the extension cords out the window. And that's where the real annoyance to this mower lies, the power cord. Whereas with a regular mower you can just mow, mow, mow, with this one, you have to mow... be careful... mow. The cord will get in your way. The trick is to plan out the mowing in a way that will always keep the cord in the MOWED section of your lawn (not so easy with the first push, obviously). If you do this, cord maintenance is a non-issue mostly. If you have trees in your yard to mow around, this WILL be annoying, no doubt. If that is the case, you may want to invest instead in one with a battery (this mower does NOT have a battery, it MUST be plugged in). Or, if those aren't rated 12 amps or higher for power, I'd recommend the old standard internal combustion style mower.Highly recommended if you don't mind power cord maintenance.Pros:Quiet (compared to regular engine mowers)No gas smell on clothes, hair, bodyLightPowerfulSingle, easy point to adjust heightCons:CordCordCordCan give impression of not being powerful
B00005LEXF I originally chose a more expensive knee pad, ignoring these because of the single strap. However, when the ones  I ordered didn't work right, I came back to these. The other Fiskars products I have purchased have been very nice.When I first put them on I fastened the strap across the crease behind my knee and it cut into me. Immediate pain. However, I found it easy to adjust the strap below my knee (which actually pulls the cup into place better) and even crawling around, the straps stayed away from that painful spot.I will be using these for both gardening and crawling on cement under our home to replace the filter on the heater, so I am extra pleased with the waterproof nature of them.  They fit me nicely, and once I adjusted the strap, very comfortably. The cup shape keeps them from slipping to the side.
B00005LEXF I do a lot of my gardening on my knees as I find it easier on my bad back. Until I purchased Fiskars Kneelers Knee Pads I used a pad that I knelt on.  The problem with the pad, of course, is that you have to get up before moving to a new spot.  It is much easier to garden with the knee pads attached to your legs.  I am very pleased with this purchase.I am attaching a photo under customer photos that I will be referencing in this review.The photo shows both sides of the knee pads.  The top image shows the outer shell of the pad that touches the ground. It is made out of thick (slight under 1/2 inch) rubberized material which provides cushioning and protection from moisture.The bottom image show the inside part of the knee pad, which is made with soft black non-slippery material.  The cavity of the knee pad is 4.75 inches wide, and 7 inches long. It can be made more narrow by tightening the knee straps or wider by pressing on it with the knee because it flexes.Each knee pad has a rubber band which holds the knee pad to the leg. Each band is 20 inches long and 1.5 inches wide.  At each end of the rubber band there is 3.5 inches of Velcro so you can adjust the pad based on the size of your leg.  If your legs are particularly skinny you can sew in additional Velcro strip so you can close it tighter.  If your legs are thicker you can add another piece of rubber band with more Velcro.  I consider myself an average size woman and I got a perfect fit with and without long pants on.The knee pads are easy to clean by washing them with a hose.  They are solidly made and feel like a good quality item.Fiskars offers lifetime warranty for the knee pads.  Even if when I don't plan  on using a warranty replacement, it always makes me feel good about a product when the company shows the confidence in the product by offering such long warranty.  For warranty service, email warranty@fiskars.com or call 1-866-348-5661 or contact Fiskars Brands, Inc. 2537 Daniels Street, Madison, WI 53718.I am really enjoying my knee pads, in particular because I can move so much easier with them than a knee pad I used before.  I recommend this product.Ali Julia review
B00005LEXF I should have bought knee pads a long time ago! I have bony knees, and gardening and housework really bruise them.Now I just strap on the pads and don't worry about it.The only thing is that the backing on the foam pads is peeling away, a little. So they're not the sturdiest pads ever. Maybe now that I know I'll use them often, I'll buy a higher-end pair and relegate these to the camping bins.
B00005LEXF Big and floppy, When you tighten them it feels like you cut off the blood or they fall down off the knees.
B00005LEXF This is not what you want for heavy duty wear, like dragging your knees around on concrete all day.  These are light-weight and comfortable in that binding area behind the knee:  Perfect for kneeling to do work in your garden.  As a gardener, with several veggie gardens and plenty of shrubs and rose bushes spread over an acre and a half, these knee pads are perfect.  Both my husband and I have a pair.  They have a lifetime warranty, too!  I couldn't ask for more.I love Fiskars and when I have a choice, I always choose Fiskars:  This brand very seldom disappoints.
B00005LEXF I bought these for two reasons: 1 - I paint a lot (walls).  2 - I have little nieces and nephews who like to ride on my back as I crawl on the floor!  For the former, they work great-  they don't add any weight to me as I walk around and go up and down ladders, etc.  I can get on the floor and paint near the baseboard while on my knees.  It's great.  My knees aren't the best and these help a lot!  For the latter reason, they're great too!  I can quickly get these on and then let one or two (or three!) of my plentiful and beligerent nieces and nephews ride on my back around the house!  Good excercise and quite tiring!  But for the price - you can't go wrong.
B00005LEXF I wore these twice and they skinned the .... out of my knees. Yes, I had the straps adjusted correctly. Won't use them again. Use a kneeling pad instead!The kneeling pad has worked beautifully! No more skinning my knees.
B00005LEXF Bought as a gift and here's the offial report:'Great pad cushions and velcro closure. Extremely comfortable. Only hitch: the liners inside start detaching very quickly.'For under $10 they're worth it.
B00005LEXF I purchased these to for yard work and now I use them anytime I have to be on the floor or ground working. They have stood up very well and the quality of the product is great. You won't be disappointed and your knees will thank you!
B00005LEXF Received last week.  Purchased for gardening, but am using them first to resurface a concrete patio.  Lots of knee work.  Seconds to fit and very comfortable.  After finishing my preliminary work, I went inside to use the computer for an hour.  Then, on walking to another part of the house, realized they were still on.  That's comfortable.  I'm average build, male.  No problems with the velcro.
B00005LEXF Overall I am pleased with these knee pads because I can garden without moving a kneeling pad around,  I gave this product four stars because depending on the type of pants that I am wearing they either feel too tight on my right leg or too loose.  Also if you are working  on the ground with a lot of dirt, some of the dirt tends to get inside the knee pads, so sometimes to have to stop to shake it out.  I would probably buy this product again.
B00005YX2U I made the huge mistake of buying a cheap $2 trowel from my local HD, of course, it literally snapped at the handle while doing some light digging.The Fiskars trowel on the other hand, is built to last. I couldn't really tell from the pictures, but once I inspected and held it, I could feel the quality and after testing it, I noticed a huge difference, the way it handles dirt/soil and the little work it takes to dig, is simply great.What I like the most is the design, the handle is a  solid metal piece, thick and extremely durable. It didn't bend while digging and it felt very comfortable. The handle is wrapped in a rubberized sleeve which happens to be very ergonomic.Nothing much to say really. This is great gardening tool that I'm sure will last.
B00005YX2U I use this heavily to till the soil in my flower beds because of its broad shoulders and sharp point.  Although its used mostly for troweling, it's  narrow enough to be used for planting and broad enough for transplanting.  I have a tool for every job but I find this is the only digging tool I really need to bring along.  If you're debating which type of  hand digger to get (planter, transplanter, troweler, etc.), I would stick with this trowelerThe handle is very comfortable, important when jabbing it into the ground repeatedly to loosen the soil.  The wooden tools I've used in the past have been very hard on my hands but, I come away with no pain with this design.The polished alumnium is VERY strong, light weight, mostly scratch resistant and does not rust.  The textured material on the handle does collect dirt and has to be scrubbed to get clean.
B00005YX2U I had one of these trowels before, for about 5 years, before my husband got too heavy handed & snapped it while digging in the garden!I love it, the soft, rubber handle offers you a good grip while digging.It's perfect for preparing holes in the earth to plant shrubs.
B00005YX2U I'm a beginner gardener even though I've been a home owner for 11 years. I've always had a yard guy and never liked it much. I decided to get into it this year and have had a good time cleaning up my backyard. This trowel is lightweight and strong and I would recommend it.
B00005YX2U This is a good sized, well balanced, very effective trowel.  The handle is soft and cleans up easily.  It is strong and well put together.  Fiskars quality can always be counted on.
B00005YX30 I wish it had more pockets but I got what I paid for. As I have used it I have found I could use more pockets but it is of good quality and is exactly as advertized.
B00005YX30 This is a very convenient way to keep all your gardening tools handy. It's similar to the bucket tool caddies that contractors used with one key different -- there's no flap that goes inside the bucket, so it's possible to use the bucket to carry dirt, weeds, plants, etc. without getting dirt all over the caddy.Construction is decent. I had no problems fitting it to a five gallon bucket, but it's essential that you find one that does not have a lot of ribs around the lip. The caddy straps on with velcro, and the ribs would make it hard to get a good fit. Thus, buckets you buy at places like Home Depot will not work well - you need an old 5 gallon paint bucket for best results.There are plenty of pockets. The pockets on one side are closed at the bottom; the pockets on the other are open on the bottom. Chances are you'll be able to fit all the tools you want to carry. The only problems I encountered were with long handled weeders. I'll end up carrying them inside the bucket as before.The seed pocket (sort of like a wallet with cutouts to stash seed packets) is a nice touch but, alas, one that I can't use since I purchase most seeds in bulk bags not envelopes. Wish there was an option to remove that and replace it with a pocket suited for tools, but hey - at this price, I can't complain at all.My only concern is construction. While it is decent for the price paid, I expect it will be a bit ragged after significant use. Reenforced seams with rivets would be great - I'd be willing to pay a bit more for that. A better gripping mechanism would also be a nice touch - perhaps some type of spring clamp that grips the bucket so the burden of holding this on is not born by just a single piece of velcro. Lastly, a built-in sheath for a garden knife would be an excellent addition.
B00005YX30 It looks a lot nicer than it really is. It doesn't fit an ordinary size bucket so I had to go buy a bigger one...
B00005YX30 I've used this for around a year now, absolutely love it.  I keep getting more gardening tools and haven't ran out of pockets yet.  The pockets are all different sizes, some very narrow for something like a pair of scissors or a marker, there is a big one that fits my PH tester perfectly.  I also have theCustom LeatherCraft 1140 EasySeat Lightweight Plastic Bucket Seat for 3 1/2- 5 Gallon Bucketswhich turns the bucket into a chair and seals the interior if you want a dry spider-free place for gardening gloves.
B00005YX30 The material is good and easy to clean. Size is perfect, just as described. I have a bunch of Fiskars tools, and now they get perfectly organized and easy to move around. Price was good and deliver was fast.
B00005YX30 received this yesterday, really nice and well organized. I placed it around an old chlorine bucket and it fits well. compartments for tools are well thought out.
B00005YX30 Do you find yourself constantly looking for the last hand tool you used when working in the flowerbeds? Are you forever walking back and forth to get the right tool, or to toss the weeds you just dug up in a lawn bag? If so, you need a garden caddy, and you could do a lot worse than this model. While it's not made of heavy-duty canvas like the $60 models, it's strong enough for every day use, and it can last through several buckets. I bought this one for my girlfriend, a passionate gardner, and she's very pleased with it. Might even get one for myself.
B00005YX30 This is the greatest thing I have ever found for my yard supplies.  I cannot imagine working in my flower bed without this product.  It fits large buckets without any issues.  I keep compost, soil or mulch in the bucket and then have all of my necessary gardening supplies in the caddy.  Excellent!
B00005YX30 This is the finest made caddy I have ever owned. I doubt if I will ever have to buy another. It just doesn't seem to wear!The size differences and set-up are conveniently placed. Construction is heavy duty, well thought out and worthy of all my Fiskars tools. But then it is after all Fiskars.
B00005YX30 If you're like me, you tend to set tools down when garderning, go on to another project, and forget where you left your tools. This Caddy is lightweight, with lots of pockets, so it's easy to pop the tools into a pocket and pick up the caddy and move to a new project. At the end of the day, no running around the yard, trying to find things to put them away.
B00005YX30 Carrie it in every time i go in my grow room.Always a need to manicure and get all dead and unwanted branchs and leaves...Has tons of pockets to store whatever i need and my trash bucket.Makes things a lot easier and cleaner love it
B00005YX30 I am relatively new to gardening and only had 2 old, cheap tools that I used to pot indoor plants. When I started vegetable container gardening, I quickly found that my old tools were not going to cut it, so I got myself a nice set of Fiskars tools. I then needed something to hold them and carry them in when I went back and forth to the garden, so I found this bucket caddy.I already had 5-gallon buckets as that is what I use for container gardening. It is tricky getting the caddy on right the first time. I found it easiest to lift the handle of the bucket up and then put the caddy on, being sure to align the openings on both sides of the caddy with the sides of the bucket where the handle connects. If you don't do this, you won't be able to use the bucket's handle, which kind of defeats the purpose of being able to carry your tools to the garden! Even after going through this process a few times, I still haven't mastered it, but I did at least get a tight fit of the caddy's \"belt\" onto the rim of the bucket. The handle is pretty much locked in the upright position, but that's okay with me because it makes it easier to grab it and go to the garden.There are loads of pockets of all sizes. They fit everything from my big round composite soil scoop (Fiskars 7068 Composite Soil Scoop) to a small pair of scissors I use for opening bags of soil and such. The caddy fits my Fiskars garden tools set plus several extra tools and there is still plenty of room for more.The material the caddy is made from appears quite heavy duty but, since mine is still pretty new, I can't speak yet to how well it will hold up over time.You might want to complete your bucket and caddy with a bucket seat (Custom LeatherCraft 1140 EasySeat Lightweight Plastic Bucket Seat for 3 1/2- 5 Gallon Buckets), as I did. I had hoped for it to be more flexible for comfort, but it is still great to be able to sit on the bucket and have your tools right under you so you can both reach for whatever you need and also easily put away what you're done with.Definitely recommend this Garden Bucket Caddy.
B00005YX30 This is great for me. I can keep all of my garden essentials organized and available. I highly recommend this product.
B00005YX30 ...I thought this was a canvas bucket with a handle and didn't realize it was a canvas wrap around for a 5 gallon 'homer' bucket, which is not included.Tip for putting it on, unlatch the velcro strap and remove it entirely so you can slip the wrap under the bucket handle, not over it.  That might be why some people are having the velcro or seams tear, if you wrap it right around the handle and then raise the handle, that would put more stress on the strap.Once I wound this under the handles as pictured in the amazon image on the product page, rerun the strap and secured the velcro it was snug enough to put a bunch of tools in the pockets.  Which are big enough for tools you'd use to manicure plants, as opposed to hand shovels and the like.  Look at the photo and you'll see some regular standard scissors in one of the pockets, that should give you some scale.So nice that I have a big bucket to put stuff in, not so nice that its really made for rather small tools, not so nice that I had to go buy a bucket but that's my fault.  I own a ton of fiskars stuff and although I know their big business is scissors, I thought I was buying a yard tool caddy and not a scissors holder.I re-purposed it as a sprinkler/irrigation repair bucket, that's working for me.
B000063XHT A not really sure if this attracts mosquitos or if it is the light, but whatever it is it works so I am very happy with my purchase and woul recommend,
B000063XHT I don't know if these helped or not.  The bars seem too far apart to actually kill a mosquito on the zapper.  The sticky things also fall off after a week or before.  Might be a design flaw in the zapper as there is not a solid surface to stick it to
B000063XHT This does not appear to attract more mosquitos than the light does by itself. The chemical is toxic to touch per the package warnings and it's not easy to get the cartidges into the light as instructed. Save your money....not worth the hassel.
B000063XHT Given the price and the length of time these each work....you have a 2-3 year supply.  Store them in the same box used to store the zapper &#34;off-season&#34; - BUT KEEP THEM IN A LOCATION SAFE FROM CHILDREN.
B000063XHT Using these in Japan. I have used them previously in Canada. They were sent to me by family since I wouldn't have purchased them again. In my case at least, Octenol seemed to reduce the kill rate...at least the number of zaps I hear throughout the day and night. It was the same back in Canada, at least the kill rate wasn't any better with the cartridges. The other down side to these (if they do have any effect) is that it's highly dependent on the direction and force of the wind. If the mosquitos' hiding/breeding area is downwind of these then great...if not, then what? Given the massive and ongoing cost of these...I would just hang another zapper. I'd be willing to bet that would be MUCH more effective.
B000071NUS I like the product, the sensor works well the minute it comes in contact with a subject that crosses its path (that would be me for now) but it's hard for me to tell if I am getting results.  I live in a wooded area with lots of deer.  They come every day and more so at night, so I haven't seen any action yet.
B000071NUS Being relatively new to the Austin, Texas, area, we didn't realize that patience plants were salad for the local deer. So, one day we had beautiful, healthy blossoms on our newly planted flowers and the next all we had were stumps and a few small leaves left on each. Talk about being sad!After a relatively detailed review and possibilities, we decided on the Scarecrow. We ordered one and two days later via Amazon Prime it was assembled, in the ground and hooked up to the hose. Aside from inadvertently squirting myself a couple of times, I got used to sneaking up on it to turn in off in the early AM and on in the PM. After a few days I got the sensitivity right and for a week have not had any problems with deer.Convinced that the Scarecrow was the device for me, I then purchased a Gilmour 13 Brass 2-Way Connector for the faucet and an Orbit 62001 Lawn and Garden Digital Watering Timer. I'll have reviewed both of these separately.Suffice to say, I am extremely happy with the Scarecrow. It is better than any other device I can think of and, unless it breaks early in its life, will continue to receive a five-star review from me.
B000071NUS A family of raccoons had taken up residence in a sheltered area of my house.  They demolished a make-shift barricade I previously erected at the entrance.  I could hear them scratching and squirming in the little den of theirs, which used to be part of my house.  I tried a \"coyote urine\" repellent  - without success.  I decided to give this Contech ScareCrow a try.  I erected it in front of the den entrance and turned it on just before midnight, when I was sure all the raccoons had left their den.  An hour later, it fired and I heard the sound of animal running away.  All was quiet afterwards.  The next day, I spent all day erecting another barricade - a much sturdier one this time, with grade A \" lumber, 1/4\" steel screws, and \" steel nuts and bolts.  I left the ScareCrow where it was, just for good measure.  During the week, the Scarecrow fired a couple of times during the night and that was it.  The raccoons never returned to attack the barricade again.The nature of and solution to animal problems vary extensively, but for the narrow purpose of keeping raccoons from getting into their den, this Contech ScareCrow passed with flying colors.  The whole unit is made of plastic; it may not last very long under the hot desert sun of the American Southwest, but it did work as it was supposed to right out of the box and setting it up was a breeze.  Other reviewers complained about short battery life; perhaps a lithium 9V battery may help.
B000071NUS Cats just love nice soft planting bed dirt. Easy digging, no grass or leaves to work around and often plenty of room so they don't have to re-visit the same spot. They are indeed tidy animals. After preparing them for this year's planting, adding all sorts of expensive amendments, every day saw new cat diggings and poop. This year the beds are off limits.Set up the Scarecrow and not one cat visit to report yet. Well, they might of visited, but they didn't stay! I know it fired off at least once and while the water goes up some and doesn't actually hit them, it does make a sudden and fearsome noise and a lot of commotion and they want no part of that.Once I saw a mountain lion paw mark in one of my beds, so if it chases them away that might also be a good thing. Same for raccoons at the fish pond. And it does all this humanely.You do have to be careful to set the sensor low enough for cats and smaller animals. In the past I tilted a Scarecrow down so the sensor picked them up, but for deer or larger dogs you don't have to. With a raised bed it is easy to set up the height to just above ground level, but for a bed at ground level you might want to try setting it in a pit. You can't lean it over because it works by tracking animals walking across its path.It does not work on critters coming straight at or away from it. My outdoor motion lights are like that. You have to spend the time to find out the direction your visitors will travel and make sure they go across its path.The kick of the water will indeed knock it back so that it is pointed upward and this will make it useless. Really, you just have to attach it to a supporting post. I wired mine to the planter walls. I had one once that I put into a pot full of gravel and that did not work. Normal soil will not contain it either.So, spend the time to point it correctly and secure it. I find that going up half-way on the sensitivity works fine. You just have to test your situation (with the water off).You need a 9V battery as it does not ship with one.Years ago I had what seems to be the same device, a gift. It broke and the company would not answer an email about buying the part (solenoid). I hope things have changed and parts will be available. I do not like throwing away a $50 item that can be easily fixed.Hecho en China of course. Should be cheaper considering. Lost a star for that.
B000071NUS I bought three of these to keep a local skunk out of our lawn before he/she manages to dig out all the grass.The PIR sensors inside the scarecrow barely detect a skunk - it's too low and slow to set it off unless its within a few feet of the sensor. However, the sensors do a great job of picking me up to 20' away. When an object is close, the water won't hit it, even on minimum range settings. What few drops are hitting the skunk, he/she simply shrugs off and keeps digging / eating.This 'scarecrow' works better repelling squirrels since they seem to set it off more easily (hopping through the grass) and because they seem to mind the water more.I like how the sprinkler head can be adjusted for range and scope of rotation (360 degree vs. a smaller sector, etc.). That allows you, within limits, to fine tune the area of coverage. The smaller the area of coverage, the more effective the scarecrow is, since the pest will be hit repeatedly as the stream whisks back and forth in a narrow arc. But that only works for alleys or other narrow confined approaches, not a open field.Another nice feature is how you can daisy-chain these scarecrows. The bottom has an inlet and and outlet that is usually covered with a cap. They even include sealing rings, so there is no leakage. However, I am not impressed with everything being made of plastic. The thing is fragile, as emphasized in the manual - no pushing, pulling, etc. on anything plastic other than the stake and then only around the garden hose fittings. For example, I accidentally dragged a hose across the top of one unit and the plastic distance dial popped right off.For $50+ I expect better and its claimed efficacy re: skunks is not borne out in my experience.
B000071NUS I grow a lot of my own food and I keep a straw mulch of 12\" on top of the soil.  I also have five cats who love to play in the mulch; moving the mulch around - revealing the seeds to the sun or they go to the bathroom in it.  Was looking for an inexpensive way to keep them out. Electric fence will work but is time consuming and somewhat costly..When I put it up, using all the parts, it is way too high to detect cats. Not only that I couldn't get the water to spray down where it would actually hit the cats.  If you look at the picture above, the spray is \"above\" the cat.  That won't work with my cats - they'd just thumb their noses at it and continue on their way.  This thing has to soak them or they aren't going to leave the garden. So after fiddling with it for awhile, I finally stuck a piece off of a wooden clothespin in between the dial and the deflector and that got the spray closer to the ground.  But the whole thing is still too high.So I checked to see if a 1/2\" pvc hose thread fitting would work with the Scarecrow fittings and it did so I cut the long extension pipe down to size.  But they've made the pipe itself not a standard size - too big for 1/2\" pvc, too little for 3/4\" (what kind of company does that?).  So I sit there and scratch my head - looks like I will have to buy another extension pipe from the company.  But as I was walking by I looked at it and thought \"Now why can't I just screw the hose into the fitting where the hose attaches, then screw that directly into the motion sensor head.Eureka!  Victory.  So now the Scarecrow sits about 6 inches off the ground.However, there is still another problem with the design of this product.  The hose attachment piece does not have a swivel.  So unless you put a disconnect fitting on it you are going to have to uproot the scarecrow to be able to get the hose off easily.If I were the owner of this company I would include additional length extensions in different lengths and a swivel hose connector.  A good idea this product; but needs more forethought by the designers.  Afterall, this product isn't inexpensive really, especially if you need multiple ones.
B000071NUS I wish there were ****** six star ratings!  This product deserves at least that many stars!We received the Contech CRO101 Scarecrow Motion Activated Sprinkler yesterday and installed it this afternoon. I just heard it activate (10 pm) twice and in the dark I saw two pair of amber colored raccoon eyes in the near forest. YES, IT WORKS!!!! What a blessing!NOTE:  Don't waste your money on the Havahart motion activated sprinkler; it doesn't work! It only activated if there was movement within 4 feet of the sensor. Buy the Contech Electronics CRO101 Scarecrow Motion-Activated Sprinkler through Amazon.UPDATE 9-17-2011: We received the Contech CRO101 Scarecrow Motion Activated Sprinkler yesterday and installed it this afternoon.

B000071NUS We bought two of these scarecrows several years ago and have used them continually ever since. Deer are a major problem in this area. Forget deer resistant plants, they will eat almost anything when they are hungry. What they don't eat, they destroy, pulling it up and spitting it out! We tried several chemicals including wild animal urine, without success. On the recommendation of a local landscaper we purchased the scarecrows and they really worked! They protected even the most tender (delicious) plants.After the warranty expired, a big buck, escaping the spray, stepped on a scarecrow and broke the spray head. I called the factory, (phone number and e-mail on the included brochure) and they promptly sent a reasonably priced replacement.Recently, after six years of use, one unit was still working normally, but the other started spraying with a very small flow. I was prepared to buy a new one as we had several new tender plants that needed protection and I still needed both. However, I first tried again calling the phone number on the brochure, to my surprise it still worked! I talked with a very polite gentleman who suggested I try disassembling the unit and thoroughly cleaning the parts with a vinegar solution, he would e-mail the instructions. He did, and I cleaned it following the very clear (with pictures) instructions. It wasn't that hard and the scarecrow worked like new! The scarecrows were initially expensive, but they are still doing the job and have been well worth the cost.
B000071NUS My neighbor's cat loves coming in my yard each afternoon to claw my screens and harass my indoor cats through the windows.  Nothing worked to keep him away - pepper granules, citrus sprays, commercial pest repellants, or mothballs.  My sister purchased Scarecrow for me and I had low hopes - but it certainly exceeded my expectations! The first day it was up & running, the cat came by, got blasted with it twice from about 15' away, and ran away scared to death - and I haven't seen him in my yard since!  Scarecrow is a little inconvenient when I forget it's on and walk into my back yard, but it's worth the inconvenience to keep the neighborhood cat away for good.  I would highly recommend to anyone with a pest problem!
B000071NUS There is a cat in our neighborhood that used to spend most of his day in my backyard hiding near my birdfeeders. Before I got five of these sprinklers, he was killing several birds a day.  In the seven months I've had the rainbirds scattered around my backyard, he hasn't had a successful hunt.  Nor has he been able to spend enough time in my backyard to leave presents for my dog to find.  The sprinklers do not react to birds, but the cat hasn't figured out a way to avoid them. Each time he moves out from under a bush, he gets blasted by a rainbird.  He jumps the fence and runs away only to return the next day hoping for a different outcome. When I first installed them I had a problem with leaks, but after wrapping the connectors with plumbers tape, there have been no drips whatsoever.  I like that the water jet can be aimed high or low, so my windows remain dry when the sprinkler goes off. The water jet is pretty powerful and very loud, so be sure to direct each rainbird so you can sneak up behind it to turn it off.  Even when the water is turned off at the spigot, enough remains in the hose to give you a good soaking.  Embarrassing to admit, but both my gardener and I have been sprayed more than once. This is a solid 5-star product, but you'll need more than one.
B000071NUS I have many fruiting trees that must be protected by birds and squirrels.  This motion sensor product is a great item to thwart those pesky birds from eating my persimmons, cherries, and other fruiting trees.A relative has a motion sensor device to protect koi from predator birds.  Sometimes those little birdies want a fish or fruit meal; however, motion sensor instruments are a tremendous method of eluding their dietary desires.
B000071NUS I bought this to keep coons away from my fish pond and it works great.  A must have is you have a pond.
B000071NUS I would have given this five stars but the connections loosen with use and I have had to hand tighten the connection right beneath the scarecrow head a couple of times.  I use the two scarecrows to scare critters from our newly created garden pond.  I bought the two scarecrows along with Yard Sentinel's RC Ultrasonic Pest Controller.  They work in unison and are effective!  I have the Yard Sentinel set to only operate after dark for raccoons and any other four-legged critter.  Everything has remained undisturbed.  And, I did not put on the yellow stickers so they are solid black and (to me) less obtrusive.  This was a great investment.
B000071NUS It sprays water but the cats just walk beyond the area that gets sprayed. They don't seem to care.They (I have two) have a tendency to break. The settings dial never worked properly, and even when turned off for four weeks somehow ate the battery.Animals must be large, probably raccoon or bigger. Definitely doesn't go off for birds or squirrels (though butterflies immediately in front of the sensor sometimes did.) For me it is a source of aggravation and would probably serve me better used as a projectile.
B000071NUS This looks like a well built sprinkler.  It seems to work for a lot of people, but it did not work for me.  The motion sensing was unreliable even at its most sensitive level.  The squirrels were undeterred and they continue to plague my garden.
B000071NUS I bought this unit last summer to deter cats from attacking the birds in my back yard.  I have several feeders in my yard, and in the summertime when the bushes and ground cover is heavy, several cats in the neighborhood hide in the brush and very often leap out and nail birds that are ground feeding.  I can't tell you how many times I have gone out there some time during the day to see a pile of feathers on the ground.  Sometimes I am fortunate enough to catch them hiding and I chase them off.  But I can't be back there all the time. Both me and the birds were losing the battle big time for a while. I even resorted once to laying down one of those sprinkler hoses and leaving it on low all the time.  But that was wasteful and expensive...This sprinkler thingy has been a Godsend to me and the birds.  It's so easy to hook up.  You just put a battery in it, attach a hose to it and stick it in the ground.  Its that simple.  I bought two of them for the bushes on each side of my fence and installed a Y connector in the hose so it can deliver water both ways.  It takes a while to get the sensitivity just right, but then its just sit back and watch it patrol the grounds for you.  Since I have had it installed I have not seen the remains of a single victim.  And the burst of water that is left behind is useful to the birds and harmless to the cats. It's true that you have to have a hose running across your yard for it to work, but that is a minor irritation for what you get out of it as far as service for sure.  When I first installed it I saw the area wet all the time as the cats were taking their chances with it.  Now its less and less being used as they have become wise to it and moved on to other game somewhere else.  It's true that the battery doesn't last as long as one would want, but I really don't mind it.  I just change it at the beginning of the month from late spring through September whether it needs it or not and its up and working without interruption.In conclusion, this is one of the cheapest, if not the cheapest form of motion detector sprinkler I have found on Amazon. It installs in a jiffy, works perfectly for me, and seems very well made.  I can't attest to its durability yet, but for the price and performance I highly recommend it.  Great product.. : )
B000071NUS This product not only works well, but it's also fun to watch!!, especially when rabbits, cats, or dogs come to do their business in your loan or rabbits eating your grass, this thing blast them with a burst of water before they can escape!! I love watching this in the early moring hours. Also when a dog or cat wants to take a poop in your yard and the owner of the pet just lets them do it with cleaning up behind them, this thing will blast the animal with water and they will run away from you property. Have fun watching!!
B000071NUS This is the ONE thing that actually kept the deer out of our garden all last Summer.  All of the various repellents, sprays, dangly-things, and even electric fencing, only held Bambi and Bambi's mother off for a week at best, then they would either get used to them or (in the case of fences) just jump over them.They can't seem to get used to this Scarecrow though - I guess it's just too unpredictable for them.  It held them off all season and I actually got veggies from my garden, whereas my neighbors got nothing but deer-droppings.So I'm here to order another this year, to protect my flower garden as well.  (I'm also considering using one to ward off pumpkin-stealing pranksters at Hallowe'en - that ought to be a good \"treat\"!)  Oh, yah- that reminds me:  don't set this device up where the mailman has to cross its path.  Mail carriers can get a little grumpy about being squirted with water out of the blue - go figure... :)--- Just editing this a year later to add: Not only is it still working (imagine that: getting an electronic product out of the potting shed after winter is over, putting in new batteries, and it STILL WORKS!) but the deer are also still completely put off by it.  Can't ask for better than that!
B000071NUS I tried everything for my vegetable garden including fencing, electric fencing, solar vibration but this is the only product that actually worked.  I have deer, chipmunk, turkey, and the most annoying, ground hogs.  This works for all of them.  Just set the sensitivity to the right setting.  Don't jack up the setting too high, otherwise, it'll go off a lot.  Not sure why other reviews say the battery runs out fast which I was worried about but I've had it going for about a month with the product going off several times a day without any issues with the battery.  Perhaps they jacked up the sensitivity to the top.  The only downside is based on the size or layout, you may need to get several of these to keep out the animals.  I have a garden about 50 x 20 with 2 tiers and tall plants so I needed at least 4 to get a good coverage.  Amazon has the best price so get what you need for your garden and keep those pesky animals away!
B000071NUS I was skeptical that this scarecrow would deter the deer in my yard.  I'm very glad that it exceeds expectations!  I placed it facing the parts of the yard where the deer trails end.  Heard it go off during the night a few times during the first week, followed by the sound of snorting and stamping deer.  For the first time in years my yard is not a deer buffet--as a matter of fact NOTHING in my yard has been browsed this year.  So glad to finally see some perennials that I haven't seen in five years.  I have tried all kinds of things in the past to deter them and nothing works.  If you have deer problems I highly recommend giving this a try.  If only there was something for winter (besides deer netting).
B000071NUS I was having a problem with a groundhog that was loving some of my cabbage plants to death (literally). He ate three to complete stumps in two days and was working on his next one when I got this in the mail.I anxiously set it up and learned much about it in the process. I see most of the people here praising it for getting rid of deer, and it may work well for that because they are large targets. It also does disturb smaller varmints but not in the way I expected.Thie product is very difficult to review because while it works somewhat,  a 60 dollar product is not necessary for smaller, less intelligent and less numerous pests.  It is probably great for an area infested with pests though, hundreds of deer or tons of groundhogs, but something much simpler could be used in your average garden setting.The idea of the product is cute and simple enough. It is a motion sensor attached to a sprinkler. If the Scarecrow sees anything that moves, it fires the sprinkler off for about five seconds. It then waits 8 seconds and repeats.The problem is that with smaller varmints, they can hide behind the plants, and when the Scarecrow is aimed low, every plant movement (breeze blowing a cucumber leaf) sets it off unless you turn the sensitivity down so far that it won't go even off with you dancing in front of it.When set to scare away smaller pests, this device falses constantly on plant movement and only sees the varmints if they are totally exposed in front of it, which rarely happens in my garden jungle. The motion sensor concept doesn't work well because everything moves in the garden including the plants. It has a false detector that suppoesdly automatically shuts down the sensitivity if it is falsing too much. It doesn't work well. We have watched the Scarecrow go off every 10 seconds for an hour non-stop with nothing in front of it but plants moving in a very light breeze.The good thing, and the dichotomy for me, is it appeared to get rid of the pest. We have not seen the groundhog since and my few cabbages left are doing OK. So for that, I wanted to give it a much better rating than I otherwise would. The sprinkler does appear to scare away most animals, but it cost me $60 to save $10 worth of cabbage.Cats, dogs, groundhogs, squirrels, rabbits, etc. appear to be driven away by it. And the battery has lasted several weeks. I just can't give it anything but one star because it doesn't work the way it claims and is very expensive for the average Joe. The device works more like a random sprinkler shooting water at random time intervals depending on the breeze.A better product, and one that is actually affordable, would be one you set up that randomly fires a sprinkler every few minutes.  It would be much cheaper and just as effective.  You may be able to recreate it with a timing device that runs on a battery and a $7.00 sprinkler, or just a generic timed sprinkler you use when you notice a pest is bugging your plants. But if you have tons of deer, then this may be your only viable solution short of a major fence or wall.There is another reason the product is very annoying. You have to have it hooked up to the hose all the time. I have to have a hose reeled out across my lawn at all times to reach the garden from the water faucet on my house. It is in the way much of the time, so has to be moved about all the time for family gatherings, lawn mowing, kids want to play in yard etc. But I did discover an alternate use!! Kids love running in front of the Scarecrow. :-) OK, now would you pay $60 to entertain your kids?  OK, so sell it as that.  Much more useful for that purpose.If marketed as a garden tool, the motion sensor should possibly be a heat sensor or something that can discern better between mammalian presence and a leaf in the wind. The sprinkler is little more than a cheap lawn sprinkler attachment. I am very torn in my rating because here is a device that basically did what I wanted it to do, scared away a varmint eating my plants. It has a major cool factor and is a fun conversation piece loved by the kids. But it falses constantly and is difficult to deal with unless you want to run an underground hose to it and it is expensive.I am giving it one star because it works, kind of, but it is not what it advertises itself to be.  A motion sensor cannot work in a dense garden for small animals.BUT YOUR KIDS WILL LOVE IT!  This would get 5 stars as a kids' toy!!  So maybe as a combinational use product it gets more stars?
B000071NUS Everytime I forgot and walked out onto the the lawn, I got sprayed pretty good.  That's the problem with this unit. You either have to leave it on all the time and get soaked or remember to turn it on every night before you go in..........or buy an outdoor  timer and hook it up to the hose, which I ended up doing.  The Deer ate 25 flats of impatients I planted last year....... along with 15 Hostas, Daylilies, Verbina, Phlox and anything else they decided to munch on.  Bought these toward the end of the season so I'm not sure if they did any good to deter the deer...........they pretty much ate everything before I  got it.  We'll see next year  ( 2013 growing season) and report back.
B000071NUS 
B000071NUS my many times getting wet testing this thing proves that it works. I would buy this again if I ever need another one.
B000071NUS It seems to turn on at slightest motion and I think the frequent on-off cycles cause it to eat batteries.  I've gone through a 9v battery every 2-3 weeks so far using this.
B000071NUS The second unit has worked very well. We had a family of foxes take roost near a creek in the neighborhood. Each night very late we could hear a fox making a weird noise near our house, I guess as it strolled by. Well, this took care of it. After about 10 days, we shut it off and we're guessing the fox changed its route due to this device. Seems well made.
B000071NUS I added teflon to the water connections,  and still leaked but the sensor would not work with the water on.  Dry test worked fine i would hear the click.  But once I added the water and did nothing.  My home is a 1990s house with great water pressure and this device was just terrible.  I also tried the havahart water auto sprinkler and both are great in theory but are terrible on real conditions.
B000071NUS I have 3 each scarecrows and it does work. I used to have cats come into my yard and do there business and not any more. I have even sprayed people with the scarecrow when the walk within range of the motion detector.
B000071NUS Well, I am very glad I made this purchase.  This unit works very well, gosh it does scare the animals away.  I now have no dug out holes in my garden and my vegetables are  undisturbed.
B000071NUS We live in the desert so not many people have grass in their yards, however we do. Because of this we attract colonies of rabbits and they are killing our yard and eating everything I try grow. I recently planted some clover seed to fill in the patches of grass their urine has killed, but the whole task would be useless had I not found the Scarecrow sprinkler. I'm happy to report this has almost completely solved our problem. We have been keeping the sprinkler pointed towards the section we are repairing and the clovers are coming in undisturbed. However, there are blind spots as the sprinler cannot see off to the sides very well. Now the rabbits are hanging around the other half of our yard. Solution- we will definately be getting another one of these for the other half. One annoying thing about the Scarecrow is they didnt include a ring to were you attach the hose to make attaching and unscrewing easier; you have to twist the entire sprinkler around making lining up the threads kind of a pain. Regardless this is has been the best rabbit repellent I could find. I highly recommend the Scarecrow!
B000071NUS The first problem I had was with the leaking pass-through cap. I covered the threads with thread tape to fix that, but that really should not have been necessary. (Minus one star, since most people will not have thread tape.)The next problem was that the water shoots too high in the air. I wanted to aim it at the base of some bird feeders which a raccoon raids every night (climbing over the raccoon baffle), but it was going over the entire feeder from about 10' away. (Minus one star.)Next, I tried moving it to a flower bed where an armadillo often digs, but even putting it on the downhill edge of the bed and slanting it down as much as I could while still being able to get the stake into the ground, the spray was still too high and WAY too long. (Minus one star for not being able to scale down the spray distance to below 15'.)On the positive side, the device uses an infrared sensor, meaning that it keys on moving heat, so that branches blowing in the wind should not set it off. (Add back one star, since the cheapy alternative would have been a simple motion detector.)I'm hoping that having the spray go over the armadillo's head, plus the noise, will be enough to scare him off, but I would have preferred to have it actually hit him with a direct blast of water.
B000071NUS I have one already and they work great to chase those pesky critters away from trees that have fruit! they work super and seem to be the only thing that works, powders and sents don't seem the work!
B000071NUS I have met the Saint Simons deer.  Well, we&#8217;ve not been formally introduced or anything, but I have seen their handiwork.  We had just moved and all my plants were waiting for me to transplant them.  My strawberry plants were gone first.  Then it was the best parts of the blueberry bushes.  But it was the sweet potato vine in the pot near the porch that was my call to action.  I purchased one of these Scarecrow motion sensor sprinklers that will scare the deer away and installed it a few weeks ago.  Although I&#8217;ve never seen it in action, I know it works.While I was out of town moving the family down, there was some work being done at the house.  I was texting with one of the folks working around noon one day and I mentioned the sprinkler as a warning.  Shortly thereafter I received the following text from another worker, who was also at the house helping:  &#8220;Hello Tom.  Thank you for the warning about the sprinkler.  I don&#8217;t know about deer, but it seems to work fine on me, the carpet cleaner, and the landscape crew.&#8221;  That&#8217;s how I knew it worked at first.But, as it turns out, it's not just great on contractors!  It also keeps the deer away.  After installing it, I noticed no further damage except when I would forget to turn it on.  I use a timer with it so that it does not spray our dogs during the day.  I've been using it for several months now and it still works perfectly.  I would recommend this as a non-chemical, low cost way to keep the deer from eating your plants.  ...and as I learned it can keep people off your yard too!
B000071NUS Like others, we've had a problem with obnoxious pests visiting our yard late at night.  The Contech Scarecrow worked really well the first time, but the vermin rapidly adapted and learned to avoid the covered region (front yard plus bedroom window).  Even moving the Scarecrow around only worked the first couple of times.  I've decided to use rose bushes and transplanted poison ivy as a more permanent deterrent.
B000071NUS this was my second one, I guess I didn't learn the first time. it also died the first season.  it was great at first. then it just stopped noticing anything walking by. it also started to leak at the hose after a few weeks but if you don't leave the hose on, it doesn't work at all. I think my next plan is electric fence.
B000071NUS My daughter gave me the scarecrow years ago and it sat in my garage until a few weeks ago. I am currently replacing her rear yard fence and her idiot neighbor has a dog that started coming into her yard and relieving himself on her grass. Needless to say this women is a real jerk who takes no responsibility for her kids or pets. I remembered having the scarecrow and immediately put it in her rear yard. It has worked flawlessly keeping the little monsters, both canine and human on their own property. Her other neighbors asked me about the motion activated sprinkler, they are also having problems with the kids and dog and are now getting their own.
B000087R4E I needed a hedge trimmer that was light and easy to work with to trim grass around my deck and rock garden.  I have used this trimmer for summers and it does exactly what I need at a very reasonable price.My requirements:1. Light in weight2. Easy to operate3. Strong enough to cut grass but not strong enough to fling rocks or damage pots with flowers which edge the grass4. InexpensiveThis trimmer met all  my requirement perfectly.  I am able to trim the grass in a matter of minutes, it works well in small places, and it gets all the grass in one pass.  After two summers I am still using the original string, and did not need to replace it so far.Note: this trimmer requires an outdoor-rated electric extension cord which is not included with the trimmer.Ali Julia review
B000087R4E This little trimmer does the trick with a lot less trouble with handling and is easy on my back.  It is a powerful little trimmer.
B000087R4E We always seek a good way to clean and trim those ugly weeds, this Trimmer does the job smartly and efficently.  There is nothing you can't do without a good weed trimmer.
B000087R4E This tool works very well.  And at this price, it is a no brainer. I use this on my St. Augustine grass and it cuts it close. I love the bump feature to release more string. It is also very light and quiet.Just buy an appropriate extension cord and you are good to go. Nothing to charge and it does not use gas, so it does no pollute.
B000087R4E Im 6'2\" and this thing is tiny. I always have to hunch over. I wish i bought a longer weed eater. Also i wish it was more powerful.
B000087R4E This weedeater is light and cheap and meant to do one thing:  edge lawns.  If you're looking for a device to do a finishing touch on your lawn, this is a smart approach.  Sadly, most of us lack the discipline to use such specialized tools for their best purpose, so don't get adventurous and simply finish off your lawnwork with the craftsman's tool for lawns.
B000087R4E This product was lightweight and easy to use. Even a person with back problems will be able to use this product with ease and minimal strain to back. It was easy to assemble and I had no problems with using this trimmer.This product was good for trimming; however, it did not work well for cutting thicker grass and weeds. I found it fairly easy to change the spool wire on this product.  I recommend buying the trimmer bundle that comes with extra wire and spool.Over all, this was a good product and served its purpose and the price was right. My husband loved it.
B000087R4E I just got this tiny machine home to Japan in my luggage and tried it out. Yes, it is underpowered, but that could also have to do with the 100-volt supply here. But that said it does exactly what I need it for, to trim edges where my mower can't reach. It is not really too short for me, and I can swing it like a one-handed scythe because it is so light.I was totally disgusted with my much more expensive Makita that would never feed the line properly, so I feel the Black and Decker is worth $19.95 for every time I don't need to swear and pull the Makita reel apart to rewind it!Four years later ----- it's still working! The motor seems to slow down now and then, and the blade that cuts the extended line got loose and then lost, but it still trims just as I need it to do. I got a second unit for the US place last year and it has a better designed handle and faster spinning motor. The \"bump\" line feed in the old one still works most of the time, and I fixed the blade problem by cementing a box cutter blade on the housing. The spool is easily rewound with standard line. No real complaints!
B00008GS96 This works pretty well for wasps but is useless for houseflies - either that or I'm just inept.  I couldn't catch the flies to buzz them.  I'm pretty sure they were mocking me as I tried.  For us, this doesn't not replace the old fashioned fly swatter - which I had to go out to the hardware store and buy. This product does seem useful for larger, stinging sorts of insects and might replace chemical bug spray products.
B00008GS96 After an outbreak of pantry moths I was ready to scream.  I tried lots of solutions but none as satisfying as this gadget.  The little devils are hard to kill.  One will all of a sudden appear, fluttering across the room, and if you're not quick, it will disappear again just as fast.  Sometimes you can clap your hands over it to kill it and I've even used a butterfly net, but you can't swat them like you would a fly because when they land they're pretty much invisible.  You have to get them in the air.  I was willing to try any harebrained thing--which I thought this was--but voila!  It zaps the little suckers very effectively.Since you have to grab it fast and have it right way up in order to depress both the buttons to activate it, I put a sign on the 'up' side since it is otherwise not easy to tell.  Once in hand of course, it can be used repeatedly and quickly and is great when sitting out on the deck.  It has made summer evenings much more pleasant.  I really don't want a big zapping machine making noise so this really fills the bill for me.  I've used it a lot in the last year but haven't had to change the batteries yet.When my adult daughter was sitting on the deck one night and came in looking for the bug spray, I gave her this gadget.  She was super impressed and bought one herself.If you hit a damp object or a big bug, there is a rather loud spark and sizzle so you have to be prepared to deal with that, but it absolutely works.
B00008GS96 This zapper is more of a toy for any age rather than just a boring and not always very successful bug swatter.When we got this in we absolutely loved the whole box design they've done a great job and have brought the concept \"alive\" before you even start playing with it. Packaging like this in totally lost now-a-days for everyday items like a \"bug swatter\" and we were just taken a back all the detail and thought that went into creating this!Now for this super cool zapper....Where can i start?! This thing can fascinate anyone but especially boys/men: the difference between boys and men is just the price of their toys..lol..;)..NO offense to anyone. Anyhow i got away cheaply with this one i guess for once! The bigger bugs are definitely much \"funner\" to watch because there is more action once they hit the racket but nothing gets away from this thing.This thing could even been used to blow off steam after a bad day just switch the light on at night and go outside and go at it like there is no tomorrow! The bugs are not going to stop coming as long as the light is on and you will definitely get a workout with all the swinging...;)I've ordered plenty more gifts and just to have in the house for when people come over and want one because this is definitely going to be the summer accessory find for this year!BUY ONE AND HAVE FUN!!!
B00008GS96 This item and similar products are usually marketed as novelties, but I have found mine to be an indispensable tool.  That's because your basic flyswatter is incomplete since it requires a nearby flat \"killing surface\" to get the job done; if the flying bug in question refuses to cooperate by landing on or flying slowly near such a killing surface, a flyswatter is useless.On the other hand this tool can take care of insect pests flying in the middle of the room, next to things that cannot safely be swatted, or outdoors.  This particular model has a couple of buttons that must be pressed and held down simultaneously (by thumb and forefinger) in order to charge, which happens almost instantaneously, and a red LED to let you know it is ready, all of which contribute to extending battery life.  Despite my son's bug hunting safaris, I'm still on my first set of two AA batteries.  Use is basically the opposite of a flyswatter: move it slowly until the grid touches the insect pest (there will usually be a visible flash).  Cleanup in most cases involves wiping with a tissue.Obviously, the larger the bug, the less likely you will kill it outright with the first charge, but at the very least this thing will knock it to the ground.  I would not advise seeking out combat with a swarm of hornets, but this tool would be about the only effective response in addition to running for cover.  Which product you choose is up to you; my buying decision was made for me by a combination of sale, coupon, and discount that reduced the cost of this item to zero.
B00008GS96 Have had for 10 months now on same set of batteries and the zap still feels as strong as ever.  If you swat a fly out of the air it will usually just injure it and you will find it bouncing around on the floor.  It's actually pretty easy to trap them under the swatter by just lowering it down over the fly, kills em pretty quickly this way.  You'd think they'd sense it quicker and move but maybe the wire netting allows the air flow through enough that they're not alerted.  Anyway, it's fun to see the little spark when you get them.  We've kept one in the kitchen and going to buy one for the RV now.  Don't let the kids play with this, it's actually a pretty strong zap.  It is fun, however, to play with it yourself and zap the kids!  And zap the friends and the spouse.  Yeah, everyone loves it! ;)Oh yeah, the case is nice too.  We hung it up near the kitchen as a holder for the swatter and it's been there since we've had it with no tears.  Seems a lot cleaner than having a regular fly swatter out.
B00008GS96 I hate to think of myself as having fun at some other creature's expense but - BWAHAHAHA, bite THIS, you bloodsucking fiends!!I first saw this being used on a vacation to St. John.  The employees in the cantina each had one, and were waving them around slowly in front of their faces, almost in a hypnotic way.  Apparently that is the best way to get mosquitoes, according to these folks (who should be VERY familiar with mosquitoes and their ways!)  If you try to swat at them too fast you will just blow them away, but if you move the paddle around slowly they will just fly right into it and go sizzle sizzle sizzle ...!  ;^)Heed what everyone says though: don't hit yourself with it while the buttons are pressed, and don't let kids \"play\" with it.  It can give you a nasty burn.
B00008GS96 I don't own these but saw them at a flea market. No question in my mind why they were up for sale (but should have gone in the trash IMO!) My friend discovered -- the hard way! -- that these deliver a VERY unpleasant shock if touched to human skin! Mind you, this friend is a large manly guy, not easily affected, yet he howled and dropped it! So you can imagine the jolt of voltage that must have been involved here! I would not want my children in the same room with these devices, nor my father with his pacemaker, or even my pets to inadvertantly come in contact with the live zapper screen. What were they thinking!?!?!?
B00008GS96 **Update February 2013**  I've had this racket for 5 years and it's still functioning as it should.  I change the batteries maybe once a year, and I rate this as one of my best purchases ever.  My husband likes it too because with this racket I can tackle the spiders in our house on my own.  Very happy, especially considering the inexpensive price.**Original review**I live on a couple acres in the woods, complete with creek.  My targets include gnats, mosquitoes, flies, moths, spiders, and perhaps the occasional wasp.  Gnats are vaporized, moths give a gratifying spark and perhaps a wisp of smoke when they hit the racket, and dead mosquitoes get stuck to the racket but are easily shaken off.A few nights ago, a big housefly got inside our home and I grabbed the racket to take care of him.  He flew into the racket as I held it over him near the window and zapped him easily.  This morning, I accidently let in a huge moth that promptly headed for the nearest lamp.  I carefully stuck the racket under the lampshade, and the moth flew right into it.  I can't imagine how difficult it would have been otherwise to get rid of that fly and moth without the racket.I love this racket for taking care of spiders too!The only negative I've noticed is that when I'm wildly swinging this zapper around to see how many gnats I can kill, the battery cover slides a little.  Not a big deal to me.  If I'm not swinging it wildly, the battery cover doesn't budge.I picked this bug zapper over the other oh-so-similar racket zappers available because this one only has horizontal zapper wires in the racket area..... no protective mesh that might interfere with eliminating pesky bugs.**Update** August 2009: I've owned this racket for over 18 months now with frequent use, and someone requested a specific update about a couple of common problems with this racket, so here it is!  Regarding having to press on two buttons to use this racket, I'm glad of this feature because it reduces the likelihood of it bumping up against something in storage and accidentally being turned on.  The buttons are staggered on each side of the handle so that my thumb is on the upper button, and my index finger is on the lower button.  I have to take 1/2 a second to make sure my fingers are in the right place and the little LED light is on and working, but it doesn't bother me.  The buttons are a safety feature and I'm willing to work with them.  Regarding the battery cover, it sometimes slides about 1/2\", but it has never slid off completely so I don't worry about it.  I'm STILL on the original set of batteries this zapper came with.  :)  If this racket zapper ever stops working perfectly, I'll update, but so far it really has exceeded expectations.
B00008GS96 I'm glad this gadget came with two double A batteries, I could test it right away!  Shaped like a smallish tennis racket, the Amazing Bug Zapper does kill any bug it makes contact with, but you have to tap the bug first!  It works fine with larger bugs like wasps, and other slow, flying insects, but the item is fairly bulkly and hard to handle for fast, small bugs.  In the south, I need an entire bodysuit made of Amazing Bug Zapper fabric!
B00008GS96 Really, this is a very effective means of pest control. The safety feature of having two buttons pressed in order to activate it, and having them displaces so you dont accidentally turn it on is nice. When you strike, you get a big blue jolt, which from my experience, makes it fun for the kiddos. Also, i touched the racket while it was on....the current is definitely pretty strong. It wont kill a person, but it does hurt, which is a strong indication of its effectiveness against the much, much smaller insects. They dont always die first zap, but it always stuns them at the least, allowing you to toss them outside or dispose of them however you see fit.A good way to spend $10 IMO.
B00008GS96 This is the cheapest made product I've ever owned.  To insert the 2 batteries, there is no flap that you open.  You have to take the whole handle apart with a screwdriver, then the circuit board falls out and the 2 switches fall out to the floor.  Insert the batteries, put circuit board and switches back in, insert each tiny tiny screw and the nut (3 each), hoping the screw doesn't fall out while you're holding the nut.  Are you kidding?  I'm returning this, because I don't want to go through this each time i need to change the batteries.  I just bought another one that uses 2 D size batteries, you just insert the batteries into the flip open compartment in the handle.
B00008GS96 Zap, sizzle, fry, flyGo up in a plume of smokePaddle bids you 'Die!'
B00008GS96 Seems to do the job. One disappointment so far is that the zapper net is actually much smaller than other zapper swatters out there. But this is the only one we could find that doesn't have the protective layering hence it still works better than the others despite its smaller size. When some genius figures out that this design in a larger size is the way to go, it'll be a bestseller. But for now, we have this one.
B00008Z9ZG This compost starter really speeds things up. I use a tumbler as well as a compost pile which is reserved for leaves, branches and the like. Although the package says you will get humus in 60 to 90 days, I am already seeing progress.  Despite a cold snap, the compost is progressing.This product was sent with the box contained in a plastic bag.  There was some leakage although no obvious rips or tears.Nothing works like progress and this product does speed the composting process. Recommended.
B00008Z9ZG Waiting for the yard waste to break down normally takes a while on average, but three days ago I spread a layer of Ringer 3050 compost plus  on my compost pile, watered well and forgot about it, thinking it would take time to start the magic of Ringer 3050 Compost.. this morning as I passed the containing, knowing that in Arizona's heat it might need watering. One day after applying...What a surprise I found... you could see that the pellets had already broken down and a richlooking yard waste was well on its way to rich compost, I turned it over, deeper this time and again placed a layer of pellets, closed the top,This watering and turning and placing the pellets has been around 12 days now and 3/4 of the container has a very black compost, really black.  What is really great there is no odor,Amazing stuff, The packaging comes in a 2 pound box, it took very little of the pellets to start and to keep activation.  Very, very pleased with this product.Now, the only thing to await is to see how well the fruits and flowers react to this rich mixture.Here in the desert a heavy loam clay is about all there is, so a rich compost that has a rich black color is a delight,Happy with this product and will be sure to keep a box available.  Recommend this for 5 stars.
B00008Z9ZG Well, as I only received this about three weeks ago, and the box says very plainly that it takes 60 to 90 days to actually see what the results vis-a-vis this product and my collection of well-dried leaves and garden waste will be ... so I must defer final judgement at this point. Unaided, it seems to take at least six months to produce anything usable, so any promise of improvement on that is well worth waiting fore. I'll update the review then!
B00008Z9ZG I use a tumbler that I rotate every few days.  I sprinkled a cup of this into the compost that was already in there, with some fresh vegetable skins dropped into it, and within a few days there was a noticeable increase in the matter, with a black, rich compost all around.Now mind you, I live in southern Arizona and we already get the hot, dry heat this time of year.  I don't plant my summer garden until the monsoons hit in July. By then this compost will be ready.  I can actually use what is in the tumbler now for my growing tomatoes.  I keep the compost damp and turn the tumbler regularly.  The outside heat helps keep the matter hot.One thing I noticed when I first used this on my compost is that the bugs that were already in the tumbler scrambled.  Apparently even beetles and roaches give way to this stuff.  And that is a good sign.
B00008Z9ZG I bought a rotating composter last summer. It took all summer to turn my yard waste into compost. Actually, by the end of the last summer, while the compost was almost done, it was too late in the season for me to use so I just left it in the composter. This spring I had great compost. That's almost a year for that batch. This year I am hoping to speed things up a little.This product contains the microorganisms to get things started quickly. I added this product to my yard waste a few weeks ago. I have already noticed an improvement on the progress of the compost process compared to last year. Hopefully I will have usable compost ready to spread in the garden by the end of summer.
B00008Z9ZG I'm actually using a 55 gallon compost tumbler, rather than a heap. My compost contents were moving along rather slowly the last couple months, so I added 2 cups of this to the compost, aerated it each day, and within 2 or 3 days the compost was noticeably more composted! Now, 2 weeks later (and after tumbling the compost daily), the compost is nearly ready to use. Awesome product! Glad the box still has lots left to use in the future!
B00008Z9ZG So, I got the compost in the mail.  I opened the box, and the composts were all over the place.  Good thing that they put the box inside a ziplock bag.  If they didn't put the box inside ziplock bag, i'm sure it would be one messy box.  Anyways, other than that, it expedite the compost process.  Good thing to have in the yard.
B00008Z9ZG We added this to our compost tumbler and it seems to be helping break down the material we put inside (yard waste, food, etc.)As another review noted, the box did not hold the contents inside. It seems like the manufacturer/distributor knows this because the box was sent inside a plastic bag which caught all of the grains that had fallen out.
B00008Z9ZG Ringer Compost Plus is an excellent supplement to kick start a compost pile. It works with either an open pile or compost apparatus.Composting is not terribly complicated, get the right nutrients (yard waste), the right amount of water, the right temperature, the right amount of air, and the right bacteria; and that yard waste will decompose to something wonderful for your garden. The scary part with composting, if a few of those elements are off, the compost pile ends up smelling really bad. This ringer product helps get the bacteria side of the equation working right. You still have to water the pile during dry periods, aerate the pile, and add material to the top. It isn't a magic wand that takes the every other day tending out of the equation.The bacteria that decompose yard waste are already present in those leaves, grass clippings, and wood chips. It is just at a very low level. Ringer Compost Plus boosts the bacteria count quickly and gets the compost pile working much faster than if left to its own devices. In theory, applying this once should do the job, just like sourdough bread. In practice, I end up getting lazy with my compost pile and let things run crazy. Ringer's bacteria are also chosen to work at higher temperatures, meaning the compost pile will decompose quicker.Ringer's yard products are amazing. I've used their Lawn Restore fertilizer for a long time. Unlike synthetic fertilizers with really high nitrogen and phosphorus levels, this is a gentle fertilizer. I'd have to work hard to get my lawn to stripe or look uneven from this fertilizer. There is also a blend of bacteria in the fertilizer that makes my lawn a lot healthier. The product is organic, but that's not why I buy it. It just makes my lawn look great in a gentle way. Their Compost Plus hasn't changed a lot over the years either. It is the old reliable product it always was. Ringer products are not easy to find - the fertilizer is very expensive to order on line. Safer Brand is the main company. I've seen their products in Do It Better and Ace Hardware stores. I haven't seen it in the big box home repair centers.Compost Plus is a great way to get that compost pile working.
B00008Z9ZG It can be quite hard to get a compost pile going. We have tried a couple different ways and couldn't really get what you are suppose to get from a compost pile, we would always end up with just garbage and flies. We researched online and watched a lot of videos. It has to have a certain mixture of types of things that you add. We had way too much household food in ours. We also decided to forgo our compost bin and decided to go with a tumbler composter after a couple failed attempts in our bin.This Ringer Compost Plus helps get your compost going. We are now having much better luck. I suggest doing some research yourself if you are just beginning. There is more to composting than just throwing your scraps and coffee grounds into a bin.Spring is the perfect time to start and the Compost Plus gives it a head start.
B00008Z9ZG I have a classic-style composter with the doors on the bottom and a compost starter really is an excellent way to boost the breakdown process.  If you don't have a tumbling composter you might want to add aYard Butler Compost Turnerto your list.  Anyone who has been composting for a while would recommend a starter, especially if you are mixing everything in your bin from food scraps to wood chips.  No, composting doesn't happen overnight and everyone will learn about composting as they gain more experience.There are several \"recipes\" you can scout out on the Internet when you are going to make your compost.  For example, one common one is one part food scraps, one part grass clippings, and two parts dry leaves.  Ringer Compost Plus has has directions on the box that are quite useful to those just starting out.  There is a brief vignette on troubleshooting that is helpful.  For example, if you have a smelly pile they have a very helpful hint on how to minimize the odor.  Only complaint I have is that I would have preferred a resealable bag over a box.  Other than that, I'm all for compost makers to jumpstart the composting process.
B00008Z9ZG I setup bins and a tumbler to compost this year.  Our city recently changed the trash system and I'm growing a vegetable garden so it just made sense to compost much of what would otherwise be thrown out.I've started using this in my compost bins along with kitchen scraps, brown and green matter.  It seems to be speeding up the process, but it's hard to say how much difference it makes.Next I'll try it in one of the two holding bins I have for dry leaves to see how much of a difference it makes.Glad to have a chance to try out this product.  If it speeds up the process, I'll be purchasing more.
B00008Z9ZG I have started this in my compost turner- I live in Florida...I will come back and post how the compost turns out...really great idea, the instructions are clear and it was easy to use...I might also add no fowl smell
B00008Z9ZG This product works and is less expensive that other brands we have tried.  So this has been our brand-of-choice for a while now.  When growing compost, you have to be serious:  About your ingredient mix and about turning and churning up your mix.  You have to be patient, too!We are diligent about our composting:  We have 1 1/2 acres of manicured lawn, many gardens, many trees and bushes and a free-range chicken yard.  So we need a lot of compost and we generate a lot of compost material.  We use a double-barrel Mantis for our composting:  It makes the turning and churning a breeze.  But we really need to make a lot of compost to capitalize on the Mantis investment.Even with all the great compost material we generate, we still need an accelerator every once in a while--especially during colder months. And then sometimes our mix of \"green\" and \"brown\" material is not quite right.  Sometimes we just want compost fast--well, at least faster than its normal slow-but-sure progress.  We always have a box of this stuff on hand.Just an extra thought that may prompt someone to get into composting:  Even with our Mantis compost-maker, we still have compost makin's left over.  So we bought a roll of plastic fencing and made a triangle using the fencing on the inside corner of a chain link fence.  We dump our grass clippings and leaves into this simply-made 8'x8'x8' triangle.  When we first dumped a partial box of this Ringer compost-maker onto our 5' tall pile, it fell 1 1/2' within a week.  So, do not doubt that it works.  Also, you can simplify your composting efforts--it's not the most efficient way to go, but it is better than no composting at all.
B00008Z9ZG I've always had a compost pile in the back corner of my yard and since I grow most of my own produce, it comes in handy to fill raised beds (certainly cheaper and better than buying soil) and to top-dress beds. The thing that convinced me to try this produce was that it is a 100% natural product and, as much as possible, I like to keep an organic garden. As an aside, I read Mike McGroatry's blog/website a lotEasy Plant Propagationand agree with him that compost isn't complicated--it's what nature wants to do with a pile of clippings. The best thing you can do is just get out of the way and let nature take her course. But you have to be patient (not one of my more stellar qualities).The problem I've had is that while I do get great compost/soil from the pile over the course of a summer, it's a slow process. With that in mind I decided to try this product. (I also thought of buying one of those tumbling things, but have you seen how much they cost?)I tried the product today. The instructions call for sprinkling about a cup on a pile that's about 3 x 4' and about 12\" deep. I had a freshly stacked pile of materials (both green and brown materials) that was about that size and 3' tall already, so what I did was spread it out and and then re-piled it but added a cup of the Compost Plus for every 12\" depth or so. I watered each layer (as per instructions) as I re-stacked the composting materials and built the pile back up to its original height. This sounds complicated, but it took all of 10 minutes. I just used a pitchfork and it was very easy work.I won't know for a month or so if this is any faster, but I'm hoping to see some evidence (heat perhaps) that this stuff is speeding up the process. I may even be able to tell sooner than that. One thing I got from the packaging was that it's important to have a good level of moisture in your compost pile--not too wet, but certainly not dry. I have been remiss in that--again, I just let the rain water it normally. I will try to be more careful about keeping this pile wet to give the product a fair chance. If it works and speeds up the process, I'll be thrilled. I'm reading a lot lately about the value of microorganisms in soil (and reading a lot about no till gardening)Plowman's Follyand that is what this product is: a mix of select microorganisms.I will update this review in a few weeks and report back on how its working. My only negative thought now is that it took most of the 2 lb box to do the pile (again, 3 x 4') and so adding this stuff regularly adds another expense to the garden.Update 5/09/2013: It's only been a few weeks since I first applied this stuff to my compost pile and while I don't feel the \"heat\" that I was half expecting, I will say that the pile seems to be composting faster than normal. I'm seeing a significantly faster conversion to compost in the center of the pile. Not a miracle, but noticeable.
B00008Z9ZG I love composting; it makes me feel like I'm doing my part to keep valuable plant nutrients in the ecosystem, and waste out of the landfills. And it's super easy to do when you break it down into the basics: heap up food and yard waste, and let it rot. Then you wait, sometimes for a year, for your compost.This product speeds up the process a little bit. It has a mild manure smell that did not bother me when I was storing it in the garage before use, but the smell did bother my nose-sensitive mother, who wanted to know what 'that stink' was. So for storing inside, be aware others might find the scent offensive. I'd suggest just using it right away. :)The pellets are really just a kickstarter product, with enzymes and flora to make the compost process hotter more quickly. If you've never composted before, this is a great way to get some quicker compost bang for your buck.It's also fun to use, making the process more like cooking. If you really want to learn how to compost well, read Let It Rot, or find a website on composting. Even with a starter batch like this, composting still takes time and patience.NOTE: Some of my pellets arrived sifted out from the box. It was a bit messy.
B00008Z9ZG ...because my compost bin smells to high heaven.  I put in leaves, some small sticks, grass, some banana peels, and egg shells.  I layered this in between.  I'd say it took 2 weeks to get a good smell going...might be ready to use in a few more.
B00008Z9ZG I've been working on a compost bin for about a year now, and noticed lately that it wasn't heating up as much as it had in the beginning. When I received the RINGER COMPOST PLUS I added about half the box to my current compost pile (a turning drum style) and by the next day found that the head had returned which means the composting process is back in full swing. My ONLY complaint, and it's minor, is the smell(!) of the contents of the box! You certainly don't want to store it in your home or even in your garage - it's THAT strong. I wrapped mine in plastic to keep it dry and tucked it under a sheltered area near the garden. But hey... smell or no smell, this stuff works!
B00008Z9ZG I have a black thumb. I can kill just about any plant known to man (including cactus during a drought). Since I've had little success with growing anything edible in the garden, I figured I'd give composting a shot, with the hope of livening up my roses (the one thing I can grow because I pretty much leave them alone except for pruning the bushes a couple times a year).I started my compost pile about a month ago, and I have to say, it's been fairly successful. It definitely has the strong, \"earthy\" scent one expects from rotting fruits, veggies, and garden cuttings. It's definitely doing something to the stuff I've been adding to the pile--coffee grinds, egg shells, fruit peels, veggie trimmings, dead plants, leaves, etc.The thing is, I don't know how much this compost additive is responsible, if at all, for the results. I think I probably would have had a pretty ripe compost pile anyway, but I just don't know. What I will say, though, is that I don't see any mold or mildew or anything else that would prevent me from continuing to compost.One thing I will suggest if you're new to composting, as I was just a few weeks ago, is that when you start your pile, you need to start with some variety in terms of size and waste. However, make sure you don't leave anything that's too big. I started with the branches I trimmed from my rose bushes. I should have probably cut everything down to no larger than 6 or 8 inches long, but I've got a few branches that are over a foot, and I don't know if it's because of the number of branches (they started out as about half my pile) or the size of the branches, but they are very difficult to turn with the other stuff I've got in the compost box. I thought about cutting them down, but given the effectiveness of the heat and sun (and the Ringer), I'm not willing to touch it with my hands (gloved or not).I know I've got a ways to go before the compost pile will be ready to apply to the rose bushes or the fledgling garden, but I'm looking forward to doing an update then.
B00008Z9ZG Starting a compost pile has been on my list of things to do. I was unfamiliar with this product but after reading about it I was impressed.Although it'll take some time to determine if this stuff is a miracle worker, it has gotten me excited about using grass clippings, leaves, and other lawn debris to start a compost pile. The ingredients included in the easy-to-use box will hopefully 'heat up' the pile and get it into compost more quickly.I'll provide an update when I see evidence that it worked. Until then, though, it has gotten me started on composting.
B00008Z9ZG This stuff is easier to work with than earthworms, not too smelly, and a little goes a long way.  It's great for starting your compost pile, and now is the time to get some, to nourish your spring and summer garden.  As with any other similar product (such as fertilizer or plant booster) start with a little so as not to burn plants.
B00008Z9ZG I've had a \"passive\" compost pile for several years - basically just a big pile of kitchen and yard organics.  After two or three years, I'll start a new pile, and use the good compost from the old one.  Since I've been doing a bit more gardening, I thought a more active, rapid compost would be nice, so I tried the Ringer.  I've followed the directions, kept the pile moist, turned it a bit.  I can't tell much difference, though honestly, I never really looked too closely at the pile before.  It may be decomposing faster, but it isn't a warm pile like I sort of expected.  Maybe it's better - I can't be sure.  So I guess this stuff isn't for me.  If you're a very active composter, then maybe it will work differently or better for you.
B00008Z9ZG But it does seem to work. Added it to a mix of green and brown compost, with an approximate ratio of 1:2, and the mix is warm and decomposing. Essentially this is a bunch of microbes and some nutrients to either accelerate, or perhaps jump-start your compost. If the bacteria are already around, as they would be most places, this product isn't strictly necessary, but could help out with the compost. Hard to tell without a real side-by-side comparison. if you're in a rush though, it's likely to help out.
B00008Z9ZG I have been making compost for several years now. I have a compost tumbler with a crank handle that rotates it. I started a batch in late winter and was having a hard time getting it to heat up. This compost starter did a great job of really getting it going. If it is really cold outside you will have to be more careful to have your ingredients shredded and in the proper carbon to nitrogen ratio. Otherwise this starter will work well if you have more brown than green. In the summer when I am composting mostly greens, then this starter is pretty much unnecessary. I save some of the finished compost from each batch to start the new batch with. If you are doing a passive pile then this stuff is even more of a help because you can add it to each new layer as you build the pile.
B00008Z9ZG I have a compost bin (two actually) and can't wait to use it in my garden this year! The Compost Plus seems to be making my compost material even better, richer, darker. I love this product! The only issue is that the directions say not to add paper to your compost. What??!! Doesn't everyone add paper? Well, I called the company and after a few passes around the office, I was told, then confirmed by another employee, that they don't want to have to list all the kinds of paper you can and shouldn't use in composting. So, they just wrote 'no paper' on their box. Easier for them I suppose, but I'm glad I called because I love adding old newspaper to mine.  Hope this helps! Happy composting!Sheri - writer, mom, mage
B00008Z9ZG I will have to review this product at the end of the summer to give a better idea of the help/quality of the product.  My first impressions were that this was a small amount of stuff.  I also think that it stinks.  I am going to use it in a compost bin, rather than the recommended ground idea.  I don't like to leave compost on the ground, as it attracts rodents.  So far my stuff has been in there for three weeks.  Will update again later.
B00008Z9ZG It's hard to imagine any soil worse than the native soil in my garden and my yard.  Here in Texas, we call it caliche, and you truly could use it as clay on a potter's wheel.  That's why I've been composting veggie scraps and yard trimmings.  The compost that results helps the garden (and increases the worms).  My problem has been that composting is slow.  This Ringer Compost Plus  helps speed the process, so I can build soil that will nourish my plants.I have not measured the temperature in my composter, but in spite of the fact that our weather has been much cooler than normal, the material I put in the composter a month ago has been turning into soil quite nicely.  Ringer says to expect composting to complete in 60 to 90 days, but I'm seeing results much sooner than that.  I'm ready to turn out my first batch of the year tomorrow.In addition to working quickly, this product is a bargain, costing about half of the compost starter I had been using.If you have an interest in improving your soil and putting the scraps from kitchen and yard to good use, try this.  It works!
B00008Z9ZG I notice this product works faster if I added a lot of shredded leaves (carbon source).Tips:- Turn over or mix the compost once a week- Too much water will slow down the composting process- Kitchen garbage is a good starter but brown leaves are the fuel of compostHappy composting!
B00008Z9ZG I have been using this product for 30 days so far, and will update this review when I have reached 90 days.  My compost pile is actually in a lidded bin designed for this purpose.  I have a combination of yard waste and kitchen waste in the pile.  I've not had very dramatic results composting in the bin by itself - it just seems to not decompose very quickly, despite following the general directions for this process.  So I thought perhaps this additive would speed things up.When I first received the Ringer product, I sprinkled a good cup or two into the compost pile as is.  It was going to rain the next day, so I didn't water it in.  I have noticed so far that the pile seems to have sunk more than what I'm used to seeing.This Ringer stuff smells like a barn, uh, natural fertilizer if you will.  While the cardboard box helps reduce the odor somewhat, I decided to store this in a tightly lidded plastic container, so that I could keep this under my sink without the sink cabinet beginning to smell.I keep a small bucket on my counter for compostible fruit/veggie pieces.  I have started adding a small scoop of the Ringer product to my bucket before I take it outside to the compost pile.  I use a plastic cup that comes with liquid laundry detergent, and I add what amounts to about a tablespoon.As I said, I'll update in 90 days to let you know how it continues to progress.
B00008Z9ZG We have an open air compost pile that has both yard and kitchen waste. After putting a fresh batch of veggie scraps and egg shells on the pile, I poured the recommended amount of Ringer 3050 Compost Plus 2 over the pile and watered as directed.  A week later I checked the pile and the kitchen waste was already unrecognizable. The Ringer 3050 Composte Plus 2 was doing a nice job of helping the scraps and shells break down.Can't wait till the compost is ready in a couple of months to use in my garden.
B00008Z9ZG I bought this product along with composter (compost wizard jr. 7 cubic foot compost tumbler). First, I examined the box trying to find ingredients, none of them was listed, so who knows what it is. It made me feel uncomfortable, because I do not know if it is there natural ingredient or some kind of chemical. Also, I would like to do some research on this product if it really works or not, but since there is no disclosure of ingredients, you stuck to \"take their word for it\". Plus, what if you have an allergy for it, but since their no information what inside; it can be a simple dust as far as I know.Second, I followed the directions and added this mystery chemical into my compost. I do not think it made a difference at all. My composter does its job with or without it just fine, it is black and generates a lot of heat, I water it or add greens to keep it moist, and turn it weekly. Did not feel any speed up whatsoever. Nature and composter do what they supposed to do without this gimmick. Don't waste your money!!.To speed up the composting and introduce viable bacteria, I added (as book on composting recommended) about a gallon of already made compost which already contains all the necessary bacteria and organisms, so they can start working on new pile of compost.
B00008Z9ZG I have been composting for almost 25 years. We produce a lot of kitchen waste as well as garden waste, and have a yard full of leaves. My father composted long before it was popular. He started about 45 years ago and I learned from him. In order to compost well you must have oxygen, moisture, organic matter and the bacteria to break down the waste.Just as happens in any wooded area, all of these elements are present and occur in good time naturally. If you wish to speed up the process; it requires some work and the addition of micro-organisms. This is where the Ringer Compost Plus comes into the picture. Here is where the micro-organisms come from.Am I sure this product has all of the right organisms for my waste, how can one tell? Only time will be the judge. In from one to three months I can add to this review. I would add.... why would Ringer sell a product that will not work, since it is a product which is generally re-bought if it works well.Also,organic gardeners do compare notes.It is important to also make sure your compost gets the other things it needs. A rolling barrel can be purchased or just turn the compost pile periodically with a shovel and keep it moist. I do not like shovel work and I am cheap, so I made a composting unit out an old water well pressure tank that had failed. I mounted it sideways  on a simple 2x4 frame. It's about the size of an oil drum. I cut a door with a reciprocating saw, hinged it and added a latch. I added a shaft through the center that sticks out of the ends and they sit on the wood frame, (Like a hamster wheel). I can spin it to mix the compost which adds air and moisture through out. Maybe in 90 days I can give Compost Plus 5 stars.
B00008Z9ZG When I first bought a rotary barrel-type composter I was really excited to get some nutrient rich material for my garden.  Unfortunately it wasn't that easy.  I followed directions but it never seemed to do what it was supposed to do.  The grass stayed green and wet and the leaves stayed dry and brown.I started using the Ringer Compost Plus over a month ago and I can honestly say that it has made a difference.  FINALLY I am getting the type results that I had been wanting.  There might be another way of accomplishing this without a compost starter but for me this is working just fine.
B00008Z9ZG New material reduced more than 50% in just 14 days.shipper is faster than the last batch and much more reasonable costsI will order from this vendor again
B00008Z9ZG I started to use composts when I went to Master Gardener school. It is a wonderful way to get rid of all the food scraps and peelings that you usually through in the garbage.There is more to composting than just putting scrapes on the ground you can actually use vacuum bag dust (if there is no food) I also put my hair cuttings, newspapers and leaves and grass clippings are also used. Letters and junk mail can be cut up and tossed in also.  All  you have to do is toss all of this once in a while and you come up with compost.  I am lazy I never turn my compost I leave it out and my chickens have a ball scratching up the compost.  I wind up having the best soil for the summer garden.Ringer 3050 Compost Plus is a great product it has lots of good micro organisms that literally eat up all the waste and turn it into compost.  Sure you can get a good soil without it but this product speeds up the porcess and adds lots of good organisms that add extra nutrishment to the mix.All you do is lay down the foundation and then add the amount  you need for the size pile you have, turn it a few times wet it down and within 3 months you start to see the results of the composting.  You can use the fresh soil for anything to grow, plants vegetables, flowers shrubs and even sprinkle it on the grass..
B00008ZOXX I've used this saw for several hours which is sufficient to give me an opinion as to its effectiveness and value. It's easy to set up, just use the wingnut clamp to secure it to the pole and off you go, no tools required. It stays put as does the extention of the pole. One easy to use clip on the pole allows you to move the extention in or out and lock it. It stays locked. Use it off the pole to trim off limbs from felled trees or easy to reach stuff. I've found many uses for the saw without the pole that makes to yard work go easy. It's safer than a gas chain saw and lighter. It is durable, it hasn't failed me. I maintain my machines and keep them ready to work, but I don't baby this saw or any piece of machinery. This saw does what it's supposed to without complaint. I pinched the chain in a limb (operator error!) and had to free it with another saw, but the Remington went right back to working without throwing a chain, bending, or breaking. Anyway you ...slice... it, using a chain saw to cut trees is tough on machinery. This saw has chewed through pine, oak, and cherry quickly and easily. When it's at full extention it's a little unwieldy because, afterall, you have a weight on one end of a pole and it will tend to be top heavy. But it is light enough to manuver and keep where you want it to cut and I haven't found its balance to be a problem. It does leak chain oil. In the yard, who cares? In the garage, it can be messy. But also tells you in the manual that it will leak the chain oil and recommends that you empty the oil resevoir when you store the saw. It holds about 3 ounces of motor oil and draining the oil is a ten second operation. Not a problem. When in use, one push of the oiler cap before eash cut and it's happy. It has an aggressive chain tooth layout which helps to slice through even big limbs. It's a ten inch saw, if you need to cut 14+ inch limbs/trees, you'll need a heavier chainsaw that's designed for that purpose. If you use this saw for its designed use, you won't have any difficulty pruning or taking off fairly meaty limbs from a safe position. I recommend it.
B00008ZOXX I have had this since 2011 and used 8-10 times so far with no issues. Best chain saw on a pole for the money. Works great for cutting branches. Beats a hand saw type hands down.After my first use of the chain saw I was thoroughly impressed. It worked great for cutting small to medium size branches. I would highly recommend this product for anyone interested in a chain saw on a pole.Keys to keeping this working well is keep the chain oiled. It does not do this automatically like a normal chain saw.Moving the cord around is kind of a pain but no more then I use this it is fine. I saved a bunch vs a gas unit and maintenance is much easier.
B00008ZOXX The saw has good and bad qualities...PROS.1. Price is comparable to other brands..2. The height of the pole is adequate..3. Home Depot sells replacement chains...CONS.1. Balance is an issue. It gets pretty heavy balancing an electric saw on a long pole..2. Poor design causes wood debris to quickly accumulate in the gear area. As a result, wood chips need to be removed between uses. Failure to do this will cause the chain to slip off or damage the nylon sprocket that moves the chain..3. Chain guide bends when the chain is tightened. As a result, an accurate cut is almost impossible..4. The tightening screw comes off very easily due to vibration during usage. After losing it, the only way to tighten the chain is to unscrew the two bolts holding the metal chain guide, move it forward, and retighten the two bolts with one hand while maintaining pressure on the other..5. The unit is underpowered. Eight amps is not enough for cutting large branches..6. It is very cheaply made. For example, the chain guide is thin. As a result, it bends to the side. Second, the gears and sprocket are made of plastic or nylon and will wear away in short time. Third, the oil reserve is a small squeeze bottle that is useless. It does not hold enough oil and needs constant refills.
B00008ZOXX Well had this item for about a month now, and I shall say it is a great saw, the only down side of it is once it is on the pole and fully extended, it is a bit on the heavy side, but other than that this saw is just great, lots of power, blade/bar size is perfect for cutting through damn near everything, easy to use, I mean this thing is so much fun to use it should be illegal :)  Changing unit from pole saw to chain-saw is so simple even a caveman could do it (like me).  So if your looking for a great quality pole-saw/chain-saw I would definitely give this on a try.
B00008ZOXX This saw is awesome. Took it out for it's first use today. Great power on demand at the push of a button, no worries about gas or oil, just the lube the chain and you're good to go. Sliced through moist maple like butter. Handled branches up to 8\" with ease. It did, however, throw its chain after an hour of use, which was entirely my fault; do what you're supposed to, and adjust the tension are the new chain has warmed up (and therefore expanded!) a bit. A great, versatile tool!
B00008ZOXX I have had this pole saw for three years and have used the pole attachment once or twice a year for the first two years. During the second year, the trigger mechanism broke and did in the pole section, and the whole thing has been sitting for over a year waiting for me to jury rig up a toggle switch in place of the broken trigger.I am about to get back into this process and that is the reason I was looking up a replacement when the Amazon \"you purchased this item in 2007\" notice came up(I do like this function from Amazon as it saves me from reordering stuff)Back to the pole saw.I did expect the pole trigger mechanism to last longer than it did and Remington needs to re-visit the design.Added a JPG to product page as you can only add videos to the reviews???????It shows a SPST $4.00 switch installed in the place of the plastic piece of junk that comes with the unit and the trigger hole filled in with silicone to stop stuff from getting in to the area.The saw also leaks most of the oil (chain lube)out when it is sitting, so put something under it.I have to do a lot of this type of thing these days to make products work: See my other reviews.
B00008ZOXX Lots of reviews so I'll keep it short.  I've used this both on, and off the pole to the point where if it died I'd still be happy with it, but it's still going strong.  Lots and lots of use.  I keep it sharp, adjusted and use the prescribed 30 weight chain oil.It also allows me to make cuts either from the ground, or on a ladder, when I'm in a better position to get out of the way if something falls.  We've used this to safely make the final cuts on limbs that were still hanging from a gas chain saw cut.
B00008ZOXX I got this for a friend who is 80.  He had told me he was looking at them at a local hardware store.  I told him I would check online for reviews and prices.  We agreed this was the one for him.  And it was 80 bucks cheaper than the store.He really likes it but has to go slow.  He wanted the electric one because he didn't want to use a pull cord starter.
B00008ZOXX Nothing like a chain saw to bring one's manliness to the fore.  This one is more powerful than I anticipated, and the fact that it can be used both at ground level targets and those in the air is an added advantage. The saw attaches easily to the pole.  Trimming that limb over your fence, no problem (assuming you don't smash the fence).  Cleans up yard trash in a snap.  I did not experience the oil leakage described by others.  The chain doesn't turn fast enough to burn, so oiling isn't as critical as with a gas saw. And the fact that it's green will appeal to your feminine side.
B000094YKM Besides the cost of propane and attractant cartridges you have to buy about every 21 days, you need to figure in the cost of using 1 of the CO2 Quick-clean cartridges at each tank refill, at a cost of about $4 each. Depending on what you pay for the propane, attractant and CO2 cartridges, it sums up to a cost of $20 around or more at each tank refill. Since you have to refill the propane tank, replace the attractant and use the Quick-clean every 21 days, this adds up to an operating cost of over $400 per year! I'm posting this because it is something you may need to budget for and should seriously consider before buying.
B000094YKM It worked great for one season but when I went to start it up for this season it wouldn't start. I did everything the manual and website said to do when I put it away last fall and did everything the manual and website said to start it up this spring, including wasting three of the \"clean out\" cartridges and it still doesn't work. Plan on buying a new one every year if this is the one you choose.  Their tech support does not answer emails and the wait for them to answer the phone is nearly endless.Bottom line: avoid this product.
B000094YKM This product is a waste of money.  It will only last for one season and its' effetiveness was minimal.  Two other folks on the street bought one as well and had the same experience.  After mine stopped working (the first time), customer service was marginal at best.  I live in the south and I got a little desperate to solve the misquito problem.  Save your money and buy more cans of bugs spray.
B000094YKM One of the costliest mistakes I ever made was purchasing this device (actually two of them!) to control mosquitoes in the yard.  Yes, it caught mosquitoes, but it did not eliminate the problem; the yard was still a mosquito zone despite two operating machines.  The problem was that while the machine does catch mosquitoes, it does not catch enough of them to make a serious dent in 
B000094YKM Expensive hunk of junk.  Orig. purchase date Nov. 2006, after the first one we'd bought quit working just a little after the warranty period ended.  The 'head' on this Defender has been repaired three times and replaced twice.  If you get a replacement head from them, there is no additional warranty past your original purchase date (even though they sent you a new one!).  Save your money for something else.  Ours is dead again.  We purchased an inexpensive replacement plan through Amazon, but we're done with the Defender-we're throwing it away.
B0000950PZ NICE
B0000950PZ I bought these last fall thinking they'd be great to trim the grass along the walk way. I don't remember using them at all last year; today I pulled them out of the storage space in the garage and discovered the blades refuse to close together.  They stay open about an inch and a half!  There is no way to adjust the closure space so I guess I just paid for a piece of junk. Too bad, the other Fiskar products we have are great. They missed to boat on this one and need to go back to the drawing board.
B0000950PZ I use this shears for trimming grass around my landscaped flower bed in the front lawn. It is hard to mow around the bricks, so this shears comes in very handy. I love the fact that the handle/head can swivel and it is so light weight. Also, as with all the Fiskars blade products, the blades are very sharp and I am able to trim precisely what I want. A great product to trim the grass around areas the lawn mower can't reach.
B0000950PZ I have had really good luck with Fiskar's products and thought I would give the grass shears a try.  The have lived up to my expectations and then some.  The rotating head is a really nice feature that I've not seen on other brands. When trimming the grass near the concrete steps and brick walkway, the rotating head allows me to get very close so I am able to make an even cut.  The blade is very sharp, even after several uses with no sign of rust.  The blade locks in place and makes storage easy so I don't have to worry about cutting my fingers when reaching for it in the tool shed.  Great product!
B0000950PZ Fiskars Shear Ease Grass Shears are the best grass clippers I've ever used. We bought these locally and had a choice among 3 different clippers. Of the three, these were the most expensive, lightest in weight, and also were the easiest to open/close.  I was going to get the middle-priced shears because we don't use them that much, but decided to purchase the Fiskars instead. I'm glad I did. They are very light, easy to cut with and don't require a lot of force. The blades are sharp and remind me of Fiskars scissors. I didn't have any trouble with my hand getting pinched, but I can see how it might be a problem. I suggest wearing gloves if you think you might be prone to pinching or blisters when you use these.  The rotating head came in handy when I trimmed around railroad ties. The blades are already grass stained after being used for approx. 20 min. It's suggested that you clean the blades after each use & oil them once in a while for longer life. I can see how grass stain build up could eventually make the blade  sticky requiring more hand pressure to open/close them.  The blades are fully hardened stainless steel. I expect them to remain sharp for a long time.These shears have a lifetime warranty.
B0000950PZ This grass shears is awesome.  In the past I had issue's with my standard shears, because I could not get the right angle to cut properly.  This product absolutely erases all of those issue's; the pivoting head allows me to use this product everywhere I need to.
B0000950PZ This is my first grass shears I have purchased.  I wasn't sure if I would like it but I took a chance and love it!  We love them because of the of pivoting head that allows to get really close and different angles.  It works so nice for the those little areas along the sidewalk and along the steps. Very easy to use and very sharp!
B0000950PZ Though I have several string trimmers, there are areas best cut by hand - like around the vines climbing the two metal arbors out front. If I accidentally cut those vines, I'll be in big trouble, and so when trimming around those long babied vines I use the Fiskars grass shears.The shears cut well through grass though thick woody stems can stop them in their tracks.  The up and down handle mechanism is comfortable and doesn't cramp my hands like some of the side to side units. I like using these when trimming around the Virginia creepers and any prized flowers that I don't want to harm.After three years the shears still cut well, and though I only use them a few times a year, they're a great tool to have in the garden shed when the need arises. I've noticed that my pair doesn't close all the way when put in the locked position. That has never been a problem.Would I but these black and orange (Oriole colors) shears again? Most definitely.
B0000950PZ I purchased this exact model from my local \"Wal-Mart\" and actually paid more than I would have here, but I needed some clippers and fast.First off, they are not rigid at all..  What I mean is, as long as you are clipping a few blades of grass, you are ok, but really put it to use, and you soon find that it will lock blades and not function. This is due to the very poor construction.  Too much \"slop\" between the blades often make either both blades lock together or separate so much that nothing is cut.If you really want a good set of clippers that actually work, look further as this is a \"novelty\" item more than an actual functioning tool.
B0000950Q2 I bought this thing when they still had the wooden handles.  Being an avid sewer, I am quite familiar with Fiskars scissors and have many pairs that I rely on and have for many, many years.  So, when I saw these at the local garden store, it was a no brainer in my mind.  SO glad I have these!  Of ALL the tools like this I've owned over the years, this set of Loppers from Fiskars is the only set that hasn't broken, become jammed, or some other weird thing.  I clean them after each use to keep diseases spreading from plant to plant.  They're amazingly easy to use, especially for women, and boy, the clean cuts it makes just makes everything you do a breeze.  One of those items I am SO glad I found!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
B0000950Q2 Love these loppers - I've been using them for almost a year now.  Great for those jobs where I used to use small hand pruners that took lots & lots of effort (you know those branches that are really too big for hand pruners, but that you don't want to get the big giant loppers out for, so you squeeze & squeeze the pruners until the branch is finally cut??)  These cut SO easily & cleanly that they're a pleasure to use.(As an aside, I had an old pair of Fiskars hand pruners that had become badly misaligned.  I called the company to inquire about how I could fix them, and they just replaced them for me.  Great customer service!)These loppers are really for relatively close branches; should you need to prune branches that are farther away, you'd want to buy longer ones.Highly recommended.
B0000950Q2 I love this tool. I have removed small weeds to larger branches with no problems at all. Thank you for a great product!
B0000950Q2 Lightweight yet able to easily cut through a 1.5 inch branch of an Oak.  Simply put, this is a great buy.
B0000950Q2 Not long after I bought these I made the mistake of trying to prune old wood that was really too great a diameter for a small pruner and I broke the cutting blade.  Feeling embarrassed, I wrote to Fiskars and asked them if I could buy the part I'd broken.  Instead of replying they sent me a new pruner within days.  I want anyone shopping for garden tools to know that this is a great company that stands behind its products even when their customers fail to use them properly.  How often does that happen these days?  (I now always make the trek to the shed for the larger loppers when I need to cut old, thick branches.)
B0000950Q2 perfect length for average jobs, cuts like cutting butter, which is very true, keep it clean and well lube, and it cuts like nothing else, best lopper i'd used for sure, blade holds up very well, do wear gloves when using this, because of \" cancer causing materials\", if you have an i-phone, you probably familiar with these subjects.
B0000950Q2 best I've found and bought a second pair for my wife so she would quit using mine and leave em out instead of putting them away I'm not really into writing the product reviews so adding this filler to satisfy the required number of works.
B0000950Q2 I bought this tool because of the reviews. The reviews were so correct. This tool is a great investment. You will be inspired to clean up neglected shrubs etc. on your property. If the branch fits into the opening, you can get a good clean cut. You have to get used to the cutting angle, but after a short time, you become a pro. Great tool!
B0000950Q2 The Fiskars 9625 PowerGear Bypass Lopper is a very effective tool, that usually gets the job done, without the user having to expend an excessive amount of energy.  This is mostly because the lopper is designed with some large \"gearlike\" teeth, which act to increase leverage, and direct the applied force to the cutting surfaces.  This results in a tool that is generally more efficient and requires less effort, than most conventionally designed cutters, where brute force is usually required to cut through thicker or harder objects.According to the information on the product page, the maximum capacity is a diameter of 1.5 inches.  So far, I have used the PowerGear only on shrubs and small trees, with branches that are about an inch or less in diameter.  It has no problems cutting through either softer branches, or harder dried out ones.  Because the lower cutting edge is curved, you can't always go straight in, and cut where you want.  You may need to alter your approach, and come in at an alternate angle, in order to make the cut.  This can be slightly inconvenient, but you will learn to work around it.If you are used to applying massive force when using a cutter, you may be pleasantly surprised by the PowerGear, as it usually makes the task easier, and seldom becomes a physical struggle.  The blades are supposedly coated with a non-stick substance.  I'm not sure how long this lasts, but so far the blades have been relatively easy to clean.The blades are described as being \"razor sharp\" and \"precision ground\", but that's mostly promotional hype.  The blade is certainly sharp, but I was slightly disappointed at the uneven cutting edge on my blade.  The feel of the plastic handles is just adequate, as they don't provide an especially secure grip, something that can be important, when you are wearing work gloves, which can be slippery.A particularly strange oddity concerns the color of the blade.  My blade is black, but in some photos the blade is sliver colored.  I have no idea, what difference this may make, but the lack of standardization just seems strange.There are several versions of the PowerGear lopper, so you may want to check for the one that best suits your needs.  This one is for mid-sized branches, that are within easy reach.  Usually priced at about $25, I had to wait for some time before I was able to buy this cutter for just $18.  If you see it at that level, you might want to act fast, as it probably won't be there for long.  Like most Fiskars products, this one is fairly well designed and a solid value.
B0000950Q2 These are designed to cut far more easily than your garden variety loppers, and they do just that. It says right on the handles that they cut \"three times easier,\" and indeed they do. You want a tool that does the same amount of work with 1/3 the force on the handle side. Since work equals force times displacement, you need to triple the displacement of (amount you open) the handles, and you will get the same amount of work done with 1/3 the amount of force. Since the blade is moving effectively 1/3 the distance you'd expect for such a large movement of the handles, it's providing three times the force, allowing you to do what really amounts to the same amount of work, but with what feels like 1/3 the effort.Since the blade, when closed, looks to be at somewhere near a 30 degree angle compared to the handle, and when opened, appears to be at around a 90 degree angle, the gears are accomplishing exactly what is needed to do what they claim. It's not a marketing claim. It's not a matter of what it feels like subjectively. When they say that it cuts three times more easily, it's an objective fact.The only possible down side is that if you need to work close and have limited room for handle movement, the blades won't separate enough. But for pruning trees, that's probably a non issue. They claim that it will cut branches up to 1.5 inches, and I concluded the same thing when I used them. But it will take the amount of force needed with other tools to cut a 1/2 inch branch. When I cut the largest branch I needed to cut using the maximum opening of the jaws (perhaps a bit more than 1.5 inches) it did take effort (but not struggle) to close the handles. But on branches of an inch or less, I've had more problems cutting paper with school scissors.
B00009PR1E Has the usual (very slight) fade after 5 months, BUT it is not very noticeable I only mention it because I notice everything (live in SB,Cali and we get moisture/sun every day). The material is thick and sturdy...I bought this for my 48-50 inch grill so it would fully cover the sides and it is working out great. Cover would get 4.5 stars but I rounded down due to the color of green being slightly different, to me, that what it looks like in the photos. Will update after a full summer if it holds up and doesn't crack, then bump up to 5 stars.
B00009PR1E I have had this cover on my grill for over a year now in Minnesota, where it has endured a wide range of harsh weather.  The cover has held up wonderfully.  The only word of caution is on the color.  It is clearly shown in the listing as having green left and right panels.  They may be green when you first buy the cover, but they will quickly turn to brown when you put it on your grill.  To me, this is a minor drawback, but others might find it more objectionable.
B00009PR1E the canvas type material is very heavy and easy to clean. It covers our grill from top to bottom. I just wish there were mor color choices, I don't like the white down the middle.
B00009PR1E It is not just plain beige....I love the green on both sides... however it does say &#34;Char-Broil&#34; on the front. It is heavy and feels very durable. A bargain at 23.91 in my opinion.
B00009PR1E Well made and does the job. Unfortunately it doesn't reach all the way to the ground and doesn't have tie-downs, but other than that it works great.
B00009PR1E I recently invested in a new grill. Having lived in an apartment complex where I wasn't permitted to have a grill for the last fifteen years, I was and still am quite excited about the grill.I spent a little more than I originally planned to pay, but decided that it was worth putting a little more money into it on the front end to prevent the desire to replace it within just a couple of years.A long-term investment like this needs to be protected, of course. I checked the Char-Broil site to see what cover they recommend for theChar Broil T480 4-Burner 48,000 BTU Gas Grill, with Sideburnerand found that they recommend the Char-Broil 2185564 65-Inch Artisan Mountain Green Grill Cover, so I ordered it from Amazon.The cover is very thick, and I believe it will withstand rain and other weather should I eventually decide to keep the grill outside. For now I store it in the garage, but I still like to have the cover on it.This cover is easy to take on and off and looks as attractive as a grill cover can. The length is just a bit shorter than the grill itself, so you can wheel the grill around with the cover on without tripping over the edges.I'm pleased with this purchase and would recommend it.
B0000AH849 I bought these to take care of a mosquito larvae problem in my bog garden. They work well and the frogs are not bothered by them at all. I have a few rare green frogs in the bog here and the dunks don't harm them at all. This particular package, however, was very dry and it seemed like they just crumbled after hitting the water. It does not reduce their effectiveness at killing larvae, but it's not a very attractive result, especially if you have water lilies or water plants. You end up with a lot of bits of cork floating around and getting all over everything. Guess that's better than a bunch of mosquitoes, but...
B0000AH849 Used these in my rain barrel all summer and we didn't have any mosquitos breeding in the standing water. Done.
B0000AH849 These seem to keep the bugs at bay if used properly.  I use them in any standing water.  Pots.  Low areas of soil or grass. Just keep away from pets and kids.
B0000AH849 I thought I liked the idea at first and am glad I waited to write a review because when we first got it we were so excited and could not wait to put them in everything until two birds ended up dead and we have more Mosquitos then we know what to do with!We do NOT recommend this to anyone unless you don't care about nature and other living beings!  Also if you enjoy getting bit all the time by all means buy this , but I would never again and I had to drop it off at our neighborhood program which we call STOP program which stands for Stop throwing out pollutants because we found out you cannot throw it in your regular garbage cause it is considered a poison!Terrible product!
B0000AH849 We have rain barrels ranging from 55 gallons to 400 and these drop right in and really keep the Mosquitos from breeding. I cut a strip off and gave to a friend.  I also bought bags of loose mosquito stopper but have not used it yet as these little donuts have worked well.
B0000AH849 The summit mosquito dunks 20 pack is a great deal at 17 bucks as compared to what I normally pay for a 6 pack which is around 10 to 12 dollars.  These typically last for about 30 days each time I put one in my small 6 x 5 x 2 pond.  I use a half dunk as that will suffice for an area that small.
B0000AH849 I have used these for years in my rain barrels. They work great to keep those dreaded mosquitos from breeding.
B0000AH849 I used these last year. Never saw any active larvae. This is one weapon in the fight against mosquitoes. Sometimes the dunk floats out if the container overflows like in heavy rain. Minor problem.I used it in the bird bath. I didn't see any dead birds littering our yard.Great product.
B0000AH849 These mosquito dunks work!  I purchased them for a small, outdoor fountain that we have sitting amongst our large blue hostas.  We only need about 1/4 of a dunk so we break it & put it in the fountain. It will usually separate so there are several small pieces of mosquito dunk that float around in the fountain. We don't like the looks of it so we're considering putting the dunk under the removable top piece of the fountain. Rain will cause the fountain to overflow & we'll have to replace the mosquito dunk more often because it'll float right over the edge.  I also use a small amount in the saucer of my outdoor plants. So far so good, I haven't seen any mosquito larva in my fountain this year.  Locally, I saw this product for between $9 & 10 dollars.
B0000AH849 I purchased these as recommended by friend and am sure they will work as recommended. I did just set up my rain barrels and haven't used them yet. All is pretty self explanatory and straight forward. I am happy to have them.
B0000CBIFG All trimmers are like writers, they need good lines. The Weed Eater line is perfect as it is made for this trimmer and buying in bulk saves dollars!
B0000CBIFG I bought this to restring my Black and Decker Trimmer. I used to buy the pre-strung cartridges from them, but they cost a small fortune compared to using this. I have re-strung two carts. and have had great success with them after using this product. The line feeds through just like the original line and does not seem to go any more quickly than the original. Definitely a great way to save money if you don't mind spending a few minutes restringing.EDIT - 5/10/12After over 2 seasons of trimming, weedwacking, and edging - I still have tons of string left! What a great investment! My property is not very large, about an average size lot for Southern New Jersey. (around 3500 sq feet of lawn space).
B0000CBIFG You must buy this if you buy a string trimmer. The string breaks often so you need extra refills of the proper width.
B0000CBIFG Trimmer line that fits, is relatively easy to work with and inexpensive. I am only 1/3 thru the package and if the trimmer itself lasts then I will buy more line like this. It's great stuff
B0000CBIFG Ok....I have not had to re-string my weed-eater yet, but two things with this item. I bought this because it was recommended by Amazon with the purchase and the cost was reasonable.The things you should know..............1) Realize you are purchasing a spool of trimmer line, not a package that you can just plug into your trimmer. When I get to where I have re-strung the trimmer I bought (the GreenWorks 21212 4 Amp 13&#34; Corded String Trimmer) I will update this.2) The string seems to be of a much heavier gauge than what shipped with the trimmer. Again, I will update when I re-string, but I am hoping the replacement string will work fine.Again, I don't know all the specifics, but  I wanted to alert people to the oddities I encountered in the purchased and visual examination.  It may work just fine and when I get to that point where I am actually using it, I will update the review and star rating.
B0000CBIFG This is a great replacement trimmer line for myBlack & Decker NST1024 24-Volt Cordless String Trimmer/Edger.  If I were to purchase theBlack & Decker AF-100-3ZP 30-Feet 0.065-Inch Line String Trimmer Replacement Spool, 3-Pack, it would have been over 19 cents per foot.  At the time of my review, this product is less than 3 cents per foot!  It took a little research to figure out how to properly re-string my empty spool since Black and Decker's replacements are pre-strung spools.  Once I figured it out, re-stringing my spool was easy.  After I finished stringing approximately 10 feet to test, I took the trimmer for a run and it worked great!  I did the entire yard to make sure it worked well.  I've done the yard a second time since then.  It actually seems to trim the weeds cleaner and easier than Black and Decker's line.  I'm so glad that I gave this product a chance.  It's great quality and saved me a bunch of money.
B0000CBIFG I wasn't even going to write a review because I figured all lines are about the same. But this stuff seems tougher, more flexible, and easier feeding than what came with my B&D trimmer. It seems to have a powdery lubricant like talc that helps with winding and feeding.
B0000CBIFG There is really not that much to say about this product.  If you need 0.065 inch diameter monofilament replacement line for your string trimmer, this spool is competitively priced at about five dollars for 200 feet.  Just make sure this is the size you need, and not the larger 0.080 inch diameter line.If you really want to buy in bulk, you can get the 2000 foot roll and save even more.Weed Eater 952711559 0.080-Inch by 2000-Feet Bulk Round String Trimmer Line
B0000CBJCQ I just bought four bags of these chips from Home Depot for $16 plus tax. I'm disappointed that while Amazon usually beats the price on most items, the price in this case is double what I pay at HD. These are nice chips and do a great job in my smoker. On the Weber main site, they list the price as $4.99 - so for Amazon to have a retail list price of $12.99 is simply incorrect. Buyer Beware!
B0000CBJCQ I cooked a Turkey on my Charcoal Rotisserie for Thanksgiving 2010. I used the Pecan Wood Chips according to the instructions on the bag, and WOW!!! They put a taste into that Turkey that is hard to describe!!  It was so delicious and jucy. I always wondered what Pecan Wood smoke would do to meat, and now I know. No turning back now. I must try some Ribs with these chips next, and a Roasting Chicken.....mmmmmmmmm!!  Highly recommended. Will purchase again.
B0000CBJCQ I have a Weber gas grill with a smoke box at the side.  The first thing I used was made of tiny little splinter type things.  Too small too fast.  These pieces are larger;  most are too large to fit in the smoke box.  I hate having to wield a hatchet to break them up.  3/4&#34; to 1&#34; would be a lot better.  However once these catch the flavor is right on.
B0000CBJCQ Great tasting hickory. I would give it a 5 but some of the pieces are too large to slip between the bars on my Weber 320 and so it only gets a 4 since I need to use pliers to move the grate and drop in the wood.
B0000CBJCQ I used these chips for smoking chickens and pork ribs.  I love the sweet smoke flavor that only fruit woods can add to a BBQ.  They worked out great for me and a little went a long way in the propane smoker.
B0000CBJCQ I have tried both dry and soaking in water.  Jury is still out on that one.What I can tell you is flavor is noticible.  Chips are much easier to work with in reference to Weber's E670 smoker box.  Chucks would be more appropriate for charcoal or homemade tin foil smoker bricks.Tried Charbroils version from HD.  Will continue to be buying Weber's version.Purchase again?  YES
B0000CBJCQ Great for adding flavor to slow cooked meat. Make sure you know what you're doing and don't go crazy on the wood. A little bit goes a long way, but apple wood is one of the best woods for smoking pork. the chips are good sized they arrived dry no musty smell no bugs and are much better then I can get at our local store. I will be buying this again.
B0000CBJCQ Being new to smoking we weren't sure which wood to go with.  So we bought Apple, Pecan, and Mesquite.  I think Apple is my favorite flavor but all had great results.  The bags have lasted multiple smokings and don't require to be soaked in water for 24 hours to get a good smoke out of them (seems like some woods require a long soak time).  Again, I'm not a pro, but thats how we felt about them!
B0000CBJCQ makes good smoke taste
B0000CBJCQ These are just super.  Throw them in a cup for thirty minutes to soften them, then the food absorbs all of that sweet apple smoke flavor.  Yum, yum.
B0000CBJCQ These apple wood chips make smoke but I have found that I prefer hickory or mesquite wood chips rather than apple.
B0000CBJCQ Please see my review of the hickory chips.  These are certainly chips, they are certainly apple and they certainly smoke.  How on earth do you rate something like this.  Everyone does understand that we are going to burn these up right?
B0000CBJMQ I couldn't find this at my two local hardware stores, they didn't stock any bar and chain oil surprisingly. I used this in my newHusqvarna 450 18-Inch 50.2cc X-Torq 2-Cycle Gas Powered Chain Saw With Smart Start (CARB Compliant)and it works great. They don't recommend you use any motor oil or different purposed oil so I definitely recommend this product. I had some husqvarna chain oil in my last chainsaw for years, and to be honest I can't find any difference in noticeable viscosity or functionality of that product over this (it was a lot more expensive).
B0000CBJMQ I wanted Poulan brand oil, and this was the only place I could find it. More expensive but it works great. Nothing to compare it to, but I'm happy anyways.
B0000CBJMQ What can i say it's bar chain oil at a normal price.What i can tell you is never us engine oil because it lacks the stickiness that the bar and chains need.Save the life of your chain and bar and use a quality oil.
B0000CBJMQ If you do a lot of tree trimming or cutting you know the value of good chain oil.  You need to use it to prolong the life of your chain and bar for your chain saws.  I just trimmed 18 large trees and this oil helps to cut quickly through the large branches and protect and extend the life of your expensive chainsaw parts.The thing about chainsaw oil is that it is stickier than regular oil because of an additive to enhance the viscosity and it stays on the bar better to lubricate it while it is doing its job.  It also does not sling off the chain as quickly as motor oil. When oil slings off the chain and bar, a lot of it is going onto you, your clothes and shoes. When you are trimming a tree above your head it is nice to have it not dripping back down onto you.This is a good product and I recommend it!
B0000CBJMQ What can I say about chain oil? I works to lubricate the chain on my small chain saw, and that's what it's supposed to do.
B0000DI845 After testing 4 areas of soil and a couple of control tests, none of these test results could be trusted.1. Tested lemon juice fresh from a lemon: pH read \"6\"... when it should have been the lowest value on the chart or more (pH of nearly 2 is lemon, so these tests give unreliably \"alkaline\" results). The purified water test also came out \"alkaline\".  All of the yard samples also came up as the most alkaline result, 7.5.2. Tested freshly decomposed manure compost exactly to the package directions: none of the K, P, or N tests reacted at all after 10 minutes, 20, 30... or even 24 hours later. Manure compost should at least read \"adequate\" for nitrogen! None of the soil samples from the yard reacted either, so the indicating agent in the capsules is useless.So, all in all, it was a tremendous waste of money and time.
B0000DI845 This kit is a great value and super easy to use. I love that they include a little packet of info on suggested Ph values for certain plants and veggies. Awesome!!!
B0000DI845 I can now save money and feel confident on how my soil is doing. I test my garden and lawn at different times of the year. This way I can always try to have my levels exactly where I want them.
B0000DI845 A decent quality product that appears to be more or less accurate however, I'm not thrilled with the fairly ambiguous rating system for the test results:  I conducted all four tests on a veggie garden soil sample.  The pH test was great - clear results.  The N, K and P test parameters are pretty loose, though.  Essentially, you can tell whether your soil is deficient but it's pretty difficult to discern the difference between the &#34;adequate&#34; reading and the reading indicating an overabundance of the given substance.  I posted a customer pic on the vendor's listing to illustrate results.  Who knows if they will post it.  I don't think I would re-purchase this item.
B0000DI845 I wanted to test various parts of my garden soil to check the pH levels as well as the N, P, and K levels. This kit makes it a breeze. The pills are conveniently labeled and the instructions make it simple to understand what to do. The colored indicators make it easy to tell where your soil currently is at and the instructions give suggestions on how to adjust the levels should you need to.
B0000DI845 These things work just fine. I would buy them again. I added to my soil what they said I was low on and I was pleased with the results.
B0000DI845 I am  Master Gardener and I must admit I broke the Cardinal rule of gardening, I never test my ground.  Even when the MG program offered it to me for free when I graduated, I could not be bothered.  I thought I could adjust my garden when I needed it myself without any help from a test kit.  Until I moved, this house has a wonderful piece of property that I use for my vegetable garden and for the first three years everything was perfect, until this year.  Nothing wants to grow, so I broke down and bought this item, low an behold I have a problem, nothing major but my phosphorous is completely depleted and that is the explanation for the way my veggies are growing.  I found out what must be done and I did it and everything is turning around..Good sound product I recommend it to the gardener that thinks he/she knows it all, (but we really don't.)
B0000DI84D I like the 10\" size.  It holds a substantial pot, whether you change the plant three times a year, or keep one perennial as I do.  The holder goes onto your deck rail in a few minutes.  While it is not heavy duty, it will hold even a tall pot easily and securely.  Holds enough soil for a second story deck like mine to trail a vine twenty feet, or a huge Swiss or trailing begonia.  Not much else to say except no problems and sturdy enough to last for years.
B0000DI84D We are in zone 5-6a and I have a small gardenia which needs to be brought indoors during the winter. I have been looking for a place where I can put the pot that would allow me to enjoy the scent and still bring it in when the weather grows cold.This is perfect because the holder is adjustable and fits my deck perfectly. This also holds my 10 inch pot and is very sturdy.Very nice product, easily adjustable, easy to use.
B0000DI84D I have several pot holders like this one on my deck. This flower pot in particular is pretty sturdy. The only thing I would change is for it to come with a little instruction book or an explanation on how you get it to fit on the railing.
B0000DI84D This came packaged quite well, and I did not have any missing parts.  The brackets were on the holder itself, with zip ties and they were easy enough to find.  The instructions were clear as how to hang this properly, and installation time took less than two minutes.It is holding a 10 inch pot of geraniums and it was easy to attach to the fence post.  I would order this again.
B0000DI84D This hanger works great for hanging my potted plants from my side porch. I don't have an overhang to hang plants from hangers, so prior to this, I was only able to set my flowers out on my side porch on my table, not hang them. This holder slides right over the railings of my porch and lets me hang flowers off the side so they are viewable from my driveway and the street out front. It's also a nice solution when you don't want to drill anything permanent into your porch to hang flowers. Just slide this holder over a railing and set your potted flowers inside, that's all there is to it! I like that I can also move this to other areas of my porch, if my flower are in need of more sun.
B0000DI84D This attractive black pot holder installs easily. I appreciated the versatility as it can fit 2 x4\" to 2x 6\" inch railing. I am not mechanically inclined but was able to affix this to my deck with no problems. It is designed with a \"bumper\" which prevents the pot from tipping. The black color should blend with just about any d&eacute;cor.This is a convenient way for me to keep a pot of fresh herbs in close proximity to the grill on my deck.  The hardware seemed a bit flimsy but so far it has held. This is a good way to bring a color to your deck, balcony or fence. Recommended.
B0000DI84D The holder itself is made fine but the harware is really cheap.  It will hold a large pot, which is nice.  I prefer to look for a holder that will fit over the rails of my porch.
B0000DI84D CobraCo's adjustable flower pot holder is a flexible product that can be used to fit on deck railing up to 4 inches across.  The brackets easily attach in 1 of 2 configurations depending on the width of your rail.  There are 3 screws on each side to lock the bracket down.  There is a bottom bumper support to rest against a post or rail to keep the plant level.  The holder easily accommodates a plant pot of up to 10 inch diameter.This is an easy way to beautify your deck.  Just add plant, and water.
B0000DI84D An effective design and well thought out holder giving you numerable options in mounting positions.  The \"U\" shaped wire at the rear of the base strengthens the holder and holds it out from the post to ensure the pot remains level, as well as stable. The mounting brackets are simple yet effective allowing you to mount the holder in different locations, a welcome change from the \"special\" mounts that require you to purchase multiple holders to mount flower pots in different positions. bogie
B0000DI84D The mechanism of this flower pot is very interesting. The part that hooks over the ledge is removable. It has three awkwardly positioned screws on each side that allow the back hook to slide to accommodate multiple sizes of railing. The screws are a bit cumbersome to adjust. I would only recommend this flower pot holder if you are trying to hng on a non-standard size rail.
B0000DI84D I chose this item for an indeterminate tomato plant.  After I initially set this holder at the desired spot, I then assembled this with my hands before my husband brought his power screw driver in to complete the job. The brackets are now securely mounted on our back porch.  I noticed that the brackets can be used from either the long or the short side, depending on how wide the frame or sill is.The holder leans a little down but that is the desired effect I want, so that the plant can benefit from the western sun late in the afternoon.  The deep brackets keep this holder from getting blown off in our strong spring winds.
B0000DI84D This is a good, standard pot holder.  The metal construction is sturdy and it keeps my plant perfectly perched on my wood railing (a plus because some of the non-adjustable holders I've found are meant for a skinnier metal railing and don't work for my situation).  So functionality wise, these have been perfect.  But aesthetically, it still pretty utilitarian looking.  There's really nothing in the way of ornamentation or decoration.  Because of that, I like using this with a pot that is well designed and pretty on it's own.Aesthetics aside, it functions as expected and is perfect for people (like me) whose railings are not a uniform size.
B0000DI84D Decent quality though not quite as sturdy as I would have wanted.Good news though, it fits 6\" or less rails with an adjustable arm.  My package had all the items included.  Some folks complained the brackets weren't included but I noticed mine were just lying in the bottom of the box separate from the rest of the item.  Perhaps the customer missed them or perhaps the shipper missed them.  Not sure.  But without those it is useless.Holds a 10 inch pot.  Looks nice.  Just wish the metal was a bit better quality.  I worry it might wear, bend, or break over time.  I will update if this occurs.
B0000DI84D This is a metal holder for flower pots. It is fairly basic, not decorative but if you just need to put your pots of pretty flowers out on a rail it will do the job.Some reviewers complained of parts missing but mine was complete. It took me a minute to figure out that I need to turn a screw to loosen the parts and then tighten it up but that was easy enough. Seems to be a good product.
B0000DI84D Overall this is a nice flowerpot holder for a deck railing. It is adjustable to fit a range of railing widths, and holds up to a ten inch pot. It blends in well, and holds a heavy pot securely. It is not permanent - I had no problems removing it and repositioning it (after removing the pot, of course).On the downside, the construction quality for something that is going to be outdoors 100% of the time (and often wet from rain or water coming out of the pot) is not as good as I would have liked it to be. It's all steel (painted) held together with welds. My concern is rust - it would have been nice to have it be made of stainless, or have a plastic coating on the steel to help prevent/minimize rust. I'll certainly be bringing this indoors in the winter, and most likely will need to spray paint it regularly to keep it rust-free, especially where it may get scratched from a clay pot.But so far so good. It's a nice addition to the deck, and I very much like that it's secure but not a permanent installation.
B0000DI84D When I originally set this up on our front porch railing, I was very pleased with the ease of it.  I was able to do it rather quickly and without assistance.  I chose to put a flower pot that has trailing vines in it, that way the frame would be hidden a bit and it looked great.  If I were to rate this item on that alone, it would get 5 stars.  But then I was at our local hardware & garden center and saw similar pot holders for half the price.  I ended up buying two of them in the same 10 inch size top add more pots to our front deck and they were just as easy to install and work just as well.  So for this I do drop this item down to 3 stars.  Don't get me wrong it's a good item, but why pay more than you should? I definitely recommend shopping around if saving money is as important to you as it is to me.
B0000DI84D This simple flower pot holder will hold most 10 inch flower pots. It has a strong metal frame with a black vinyl coating so it holds up well against weathering and it's rust resistant. It's very easy to get set up and is fully adjustable. It should be able to hang on most deck railings, balconies and maybe some fences that have a flat top on them. It's very strong and shouldn't have any problem holding even a really heavy pot.
B0000DI84D This adjustable flower pot holder works marvelously in a typically difficult area I enjoy having a flowering plant.  I usually end up having a hanging plant, but with this adjustable pot it's very easy to attach to a board on the side of my barn.  There's a weathered two-by-four hammered into the side and instead of hanging a plant on the edge, I can now arrange it in a complementary fashion.  The bumper keeps it from swaying and keeps the holder and pot level.  If you have one of those oddball spots where you'd like to have a plant, the CobraCo just may have solved your problem.I opted for a rather heavy plant and didn't experience any problem with forward bending.  The design of this adjustable flower pot is perfect and quite well-balanced.  If you are also in the market for an adjustable flower box holder, CobraCo has a36-inch black adjustable/expandable flower box holderand a24-inch adjustable white flower box holder.  These would look especially nice on a balcony.  Weather resistance for this type of item is usually quite good (I have standing pot holders like this), but I'd recommend taking them in for the season.  I love this innovative adjustable pot holder and can't find a thing I don't like about it.
B0000DI84D I can't get over how easily this product changes to fit my needs.  I have a wide railed deck railing outside and  narrow railed wrought iron railing around a balcony in my living room inside.  I can switch this within in minutes to fit either railing.I don't know how long it will have to be out in the weather to affect the paint on this, but I tried a sharp knife  and it took a very sharp one and a lot of pressure to even scratch this - but yes it does scratch under a lot of abuse.It is built so that it has a piece in the back that acts a bit like a stabilizer so that the flower pot will not be at to sharp of an angle -water/heavy rain will drain out but the soil will stay inside the pot.
B0000DI84D I have this attached to my rails on my back porch.  I just planted a bunch of geraniums(red and white)and put the pot into the holder when I was done.  Very sturdy-that was one thing that I was afraid of was that it was going to fall over. But the brackets are very firm-dont think I will have a problem with them this summer.Nice product. It looks better when you get it. When I saw it on Amazon it looked very cheap but not when you get it.Might buy a couple more to match the one I just got!
B0000DI84D The CobraCo R0926-B 10-Inch Adjustable Flower Pot Holder in black is perfect for iron or wooden fencing, balconies or decks. It can be easily adjusted to fit multiple thicknesses of railing. The holder is vinyl coated so will not rust. Holds even heavy plants up to those in 10\" pots level. Also comes in white.
B0000DI84D This hanger works great. It is adjustable. It is very sturdy and holds a good size planter. I am using it instead of hanging baskets on my front porch and it looks really cute.
B0000DI84D It is flexible, can hold 50+ pounds (lbs), and sit on practically any railing up to 6-inch wide incl. thin panels of thick glass thanks to the clever design of the adjustable attachment brackets.  You can ignore the manufacturer's claim that the bracket can adjust 2-6 inches.  When using only 1 or 2 bracket's bolts (of 3) closest to the pot's bowl - after bending down the end of the horizontal flat (bar) of the L-shaped clasp - the vertical clasp's flat (bar) holding the pot can be fastened as close to the bowl as 0 inches.  It is safe to use just 1 bolt, as the distribution of even a high vertical load results in a very small horizontal component force, which can very little pull (shear away) the bolts, one of which can easily handle.  However, 
B0000DI84D So this flow pot is adjustable, can attach to deck railing, and will, in fact, hold a flow pot.  So as far as meeting expectations to the letter, sure, it worked out.  It's OK.But actually using it brings up some downsides.  The metal, while strong, when supporting a wide-based pot, seems like it's taxing its available strength to hold the bot up.  Also, depending on the pot, the side rails may be too high or, in my case, far to low to hold a tall pot in a way that looks and feel secure.  Nothing has broken or fallen out, but...I'm just waiting for it to happen.Overall, it's an OK adjustable pot holder, but it doesn't impress me very much and really isn't any better than average.
B0000DI84D This pot holder is really sturdy, much more than any other pot holder I have tried of its size.  It also has a lot of flexibility in the size of the brackets to adjust to different railings or fences.I tried this flower pot holder out in a couple of places before I found one that had the best sunlight and water possibilities - morning sun and only partial cover by a porch roof.  Then I decided on a great kindness to the plant, a vine that doesn't like trouble, and I put it on the side of the fence that faces my husband's garden instead of mine.  His side has about 90% better chance (okay, 100%) of being watered in a timely manner.  I have the general attitude that if plants are meant to live, they will -- except during the drought, and then even I showed better sense than that.The only thing I could have wished from this would be for a little more depth.  The size of the pot that will fit in here really is 7 inches at the bottom.  I repotted the vine I was putting in here to make it shorter but I may have trouble with the vine later.  :D
B0000DI84D I love these adjustable flower pot holders.  They keep the flowers at a higher level to enjoy as they hang on the deck railings rather than simply sitting on the deck. They are adjustable to fit most deck railings.
B0000DI84D The flower pot holder is adjustable to fit.  It is fairly sturdy and is easy to assemble.  You will need a philips screw driver to put finish assembly.  The only thing that I am not happy with is that put zip ties all over it and it was hard to cut with regular scissors.  I found that to be annoying.  But, I still find it to be a nicely made product.
B0000DI84D I haven't had this flower pot holder long enough to really see how beautiful it will be hanging on my deck rail  because it's too early for my plants to bloom or vine.  Soon I know it will be a real attraction and add a lot to our enjoyment.  The pot fits securely and I've planted petunias along with some vining plants.  Plan to buy some \"partners\" for it as soon as I can find them on the market.
B0000DI84D This is a nice sturdy product but it doesn't work well on my deck railing.  I have a board railing with slats, rather than a thick beam, and the unit just falls off if bumped.  When I move it so it sets against the slat it doesn't lie flat on the top.I can secure it by putting another screw or bolt behind the rail, but it's not supposed to need that. If you plan to order these, get just one first, and make sure it will work for you before buying enough for all your petunias.
B0000DI84D No way does this product perform as promised.  And what a waste of time it was trying to make it work!I don't think this company considered all the possible railing configurations before making its claims.We have a wooden railing on our deck.  At the top of the rail, one 2x4 is on end and it is topped by a 2x4 laying flat.  Any which way we tried it, it did not hold, would not grip the railing and kept falling forward. The screws are on the bottom of the L-shaped arms that are supposed to hug the railing.  How in the world are you supposed to tighten them when they are facing the railing?  Only if you assemble it OFF the railing; then you can't get it ON the railing.(I think I got all the parts:  I received the basket, two L-shaped arms, six flat-head screws and six plastic cap nuts.)
B0000DI84D We set up the porch this weekend (clean, bring up the furniture, put up the screens and shades) and I installed this pot holder on the deck railing with a pot of tourenia. It was quick, simple and the holder seems sturdy enough to give us several seasons of use. I'm considering getting two more as it's a big deck.
B0000DI84D This is very simple to assemble and adjust. I put it on my wooden deck railing with no problem. It's sturdier than I expected and can hold a big pot of flowers without moving. The design is plain, so you'll probably want a pretty pot to put in it. Great for renters like me who need non-permanent solutions for landscaping and decorating.
B0000DI84D The printed instructions on this wire hanging flower pit leave a little to be desired, but I can't complain about the adjustability. The bracket part really does accommodate a large variety of ledges and edges.The holder looks unassuming when hanging over the fence, and is big enough for most medium plant pots. It looks GREAT with a flowering plant draping down over the edges.The black vinyl coating is nice and should help keep this from getting rusty too soon. It seems pretty strong, and the weight of a potted plant seems to stabilize things quite well.For some reason, my set came with four extra metal brackets, and a ton of extra bolts. I wasn't able to figure out what to do with the extra brackets, which are metal, like the entire set-up. I will probably recycle them, unless I can figure out a reason to keep them around.
B0000DI84D This is a wonderfully realized product. Whether mounted over narrow or wide railings, the included brackets configure securely for either wide or narrow installations.The ten-inch option that I acquired has a depth of five and a half inches - eight inch baskets are also available, both in either black or white. The construction is sturdy. The bumper that keeps the holder level against the vertical support of the mounting area is rounded, so that no matter where I install this, I am not at all worried about scuffs, scratches or unsightly indentations.I love CobraCo's Adjustable Flower Pot Holder. This is the perfect item for helping to get another flower pot up and out of the way. It's well-built, it's easy to use and it really livens things up.
B0000DI84D I'm really pleased with this Flower Pot Basket.  It was so easy to put together and can handle a10 inch flower pot.  I placed it on my front porch rail and it is a perfect fit.
B0000DI84D While I am happy that this flower pot holder seems sturdy enough to hold a fairly large pot, weighted down with soil and water, I'm not sure how long it will hold up in outside conditions.The basket comes with two removable 'L' brackets that can be positioned with the 'long' side up an horizontal to the ground for wider railings or short side up and horizontal to the ground for shorter railings. There are three bolts and nuts to hold it together.The problem started for me on the install. My prefab (plastic) railings are just a hair too wide to use the short side of the L bracket so if I use the long side of the bracket it sticks out into the basket area by inches. Which means that any flower pot put inside is then hindered by the brackets taking up some of the valuable area to place your pot. I also had trouble trying to tighten the nuts to keep it together since they are underneath the bracket arm. You have to tighten them and then put it back on the railing.There is a part that rests against your banister to keep the basket in a level position.It's nice but not great. Since everyone's railings are different, I guess designing a better one is a tough task. This one is recommended with some reservation.
B0000DI84D We have coyote fences in my neck of the wood which are Latilla wood rods wrapped around an iron post. It's not always easy to find something which will hang easily on the inside of the fence, which is why I was interested to see this planter design. I find it works perfectly although it may be just a tad too flimsy for anything with a substantial weight. That being said, I think it will hold up lighter plants with no problems whatsoever.It looks well built and the adjustable part screwed together nicely. The other nice part about this is that you can move it wherever the sun is and then move it back to a shady place to rest for a while. It's a nice idea and I will recommend it to my neighbors who are always trying to figure out gadgets so they can hang flowers on their coyote fences.
B0000DI84D We have all different types of fencing in our yard--split rail, decking and wood fence. The CobraCo flower pot holder accommodates them all.  It has a nifty L-shaped clasp that adjusts two ways to hang from virtually any support--for thinner railings (2-4\") and thicker railings (4.5-6\").  I was worried this pot holder would be like so many others that tilt forward on an angle when a heavy plant is actually sitting in it.  To my delight, it sits perfectly vertical, thanks to another nice feature, a bumper that hits up against rails and prevents any slant.  This is a generous sized pot holder.  It can fit up to 10\" pots, and if weight is an issue, it could also hold a large coco fiber liner instead.  One of my favorite summer pastimes is relocating flower baskets, and this is the perfect gardening companion.
B0000DI84D This is an adjustable pot hanger that will work on most railings, decks, etc.It definitely does not have a high-end look, and I do wonder at its durability, but it'll work for most situations.If you need a lot of these it could get pricey.
B0000DI84D Fast, secure shipping. Everything was inside the box & nothing was missing.I dont know why the other person had problems with lost brackets, but mine were secured inside the bottom of the basket by 2 zip ties. Hard to spot right off....... but they were there.Would I buy again from this vendor.........100% yes.
B0000DI84D This is a nice, versatile pot holder for any sort of railing.  We live in a townhouse, and each unit has a fenced-in, concrete patio.  There's really no place to plant flowers, so a container garden is an only option.  I didn't want many containers crowding the ground of my small patio, so I opted for hanging them places.This pot holder is exactly what I needed.  It's 10 inches at the top, and will accommodate a range of flower pots.  The fastener is adjustable, to make them useful in a wide variety of locations.  I was able to fit it to our fencing perfectly.  It's sturdy and well-made, and I expect it will last through many cycles of flowers.
B0000DI84D The CobraCo Adjustable Flower Pot Holder is nicer than expected&mdash;the black vinyl-coated metal is much stronger than the holder it replaced.  Because of the wind, a drill was used to install it permanently on a deck railing with six heavy-duty wood screws.  It will hold any standard 8 or 10 in. flower pot and doesn't compete with the plant for attention.
B0000DI84D This product works well for what I want it to do - fit on an oddly sized apartment complex's railing.  It is adjustable.  Just works.
B0000DI84D Easy to use and adjust for my patio. It holds my flowers securely, no complains. I also don't see any signs of rust yet, but it rained only 2-3 times.
B0000DI84D Having a balcony pot holder makes my garden more interesting.  Since it can be adjusted fairly tightly on the ledge, it won't fall down, and the plant will not accidentally topple over the way it would if I just placed it on the balcony ledge without a pot holder. Staggering the plant pot heights from high to low allows each plant to have an individual focal point, and the pot holder sits up the highest on the ledge so that's great.The holder is easy to adjust with a variety of three holes per side and screws to secure it.  However, my balcony ledge is a little wide so I can only use one screw per side.  That isn't really a problem since my pot is balanced correctly thanks to the pot's non-tip bumper in the back bottom of the holder.  Also I like the fact that the holder is light weight and black is preferable, though it also comes in white. In addition, it is easy to move around or change the position of the pot and readjust the screws.  The only negative about the screws is that they are a bit difficult to tighten by hand unless you use a tool. Once it is all set up, it seems very secure and looks great on my balcony.
B0000DI84D This is a no frills Adjustable Flower Pot Holder, but it doesn't really need any frills. There is no fancy ironworks on this one, but it really doesn't need it as long as it works.  I put this on on my 4\" railing and it felt secure. I lined mine with the brown liners that come from hardware store so that you just have to put in the dirt and it looks great!  It can hold up to a 10\" pot of flowers and that's pretty wide!  All in all, I like it!  This on is Vinyl-coated steel and the longer one the same company makes is Powder-coated steel and feels much more substantial.  Couldn't ask for anything to be different.
B0000DI84D First of all this does what it is supposed to and in that it is a fine product.However,Took me awhile to figure out how to get it to work (directions not so clear and not 100% self explanatory)The screws and slides allow for probably most desk rail widths.  But the tricky part is that there is a support on the pot which requires that it be braced against a post or a baluster/picket.  My deck railing has a very old style (and no longer code) style \"X\" between posts.  This left very little spacing options for where the pot could be placed.  From below it looks lovely but a direct look at it the two anchors to the railing don't looks so neat (tempted to place a pot on top of them to hide them).
B0000DI84D Over the years I have tried a number of flower pot holders and have always been disappointed with the quality of them. This flower pot holder is made of strong and sturdy steel that is vinyl coated and rust proof so I don't have to worry about rust stains on my deck rails or the holder hanging crooked because of the flower pot weight. It can hold up to 10\" flower pots or even several small flower pots so it has great versatility. It was easy to install and looks simple, yet gorgeous. The only thing I didn't like was having to drill my new deck to install the flower pot holder. Overall, it's a great item that's a cut above the rest.
B0000DI84D This 10-inch flower pot holder seems to be well made and sturdy.  It's a tiny bit tedious to put together, because there are 6 screws and nuts, but really after you do it one time, it's unlikely that you will have to do it again.  Plus this designed insures a solid mount with no bending.What I liked was that you can put the slidey bars on two ways for more flexibility.What I didn't like, and which earned the holder the extraction of one-star, was that despite the flexibility previously described, it did not fit my rail.  Really, we have a basic deck.  Rails are 2x2\" risers with 1x4\" flat tops.The solution to this was actually easy and consisted of taking the screws out and moving the sliding bar to the top, rather than on the bottom of the bar attached to the wire frame.  That way it pokes out a little bit past the ring, but works perfectly.Since there's a fix that will make this plant holder fit almost any rail, I don't have any problem recommending it.
B0000DI84D This is really nice!  It's also bigger than I expected it to be.  It attached to my deck rail very easily and seems really good and sturdy.  I put a heavy pot of flowers inside and it looks great! It hold the pot in place nicely with very little movement and it's so well constructed that it doesn't take away from the look of the pot itself. I plan on getting some more of these!
B0000DI84D ON the positive first, this planter is what it says- a hanger for potted plants so that one can mount on rails or other horizontal surfaces. The paint and fittings appear to be weather resistant- so I don't anticipate anything rusting out.  The wire frame is heavy enough to adequately support a pot, soil and plant.  The mounting system is designed well, I hung this on my deck rail and feel comfortable it will be good there.  It looks nice and the black color I choose doesn't conflict with anything.The negative is in the hardware.  I don't want to be too insulting, but it literally looks like someone at the factory said, \"hey, we've got a bunch of these- use them!\"The hardware consist of flat head slotted screws that come up through the bottom of the part of the frame that goes over the rail.  That seems like a good idea, except the bottom of the frame is an non-camferred slot- so the screws stick out.  The nuts on top are plastic acorn nuts that don't have a metal inside.  This makes them easy to cross thread, easy to over tighten and generally, difficult to deal with.  It seems to me that a combination of a carriage bolt (so you didn't have to hold the bottom, it would hold itself) and a better nut could have made this so much easier to deal with.So, maybe what I'm saying is that this is a perfectly acceptable hanger- but that its harder to deal with then it should be.
B0000DI84D As an avid gardener with a deer problem, most of my plants are in hanging baskets and I was really hoping this flower pot holder would expand the possible places that I could use for more new plants.However with the rather limited ability to adjust the support of this flower pot holder, I quickly found that I would actually have to buy some lumber and add a wider board to either my fence or my house to accomidate the CobraCo holder.The package states to use the short end of the enclosed L shaped clasp for 2 to 4 inch railings,but actually it will not go below 2 and 2/4 inches, so the claim of wood top railings up to2 and 3/4 inches is actually incorrect, this flower pot holder will not fit on anything smaller than2 3/4 inches.Of course, now that I know that, I had to reconsider where to put it as my fence railingsare the standard 2 inch wide boards that are actually 1 1/2 in (38 mm) wide. Dimensional lumbersizes are calculated from the size of the green wood, which shrinks as it dries.Recommendation, mixed feelings here, if you have a deck with wide enough railings, this would work well, but for most fences it would not work.
B0000DI84D This is a substantial, yet almost invisible pot holder. Come to think of it, though, I have a light pot and plant in it; if I had this attached to a railing on a second story or higher railing, I would think twice about placing a heavy pot in it for fear that it might break and fall. I like it fine on our first floor railing.The nuts to adjust the holder could be better. I would suggest using stainless steel wing nuts--or even plastic with brass thread insert knobs--to replace the acorn nuts. Even with those changes, this is still a reasonably-priced plant pot holder.
B0000DI84D This is a simple sturdy product that works.  It is holding a potted Geranium easily on my porch railing.This is easy to put together. When you hang this on a railing the flower pot holder is held securely thanks to two brackets and a bottom overhang.There are three screws on each side of the top of the flower pot holder.  There are two brackets that the screws hold.  On the bottom of the flower pot holder there is a four and a half inch by two and a half inch overhang on the back of the holder. The brackets and the bottom overhang secure the flower pot holder in place.The instructions say this will work on iron, aluminum and wood top railings up to 2 3/4 and wooded 2x4 and 2x6 railings.  It fits up to 10 inch pots.This is sturdy and seems like it is made to last.
B0000DI84D This is a very handy and attractive pant holder. Most of all, it is so easy to install, and if I decide to move it to another location, also very easy. Right now it's holding my pot of blooming daffodils of my front porch railing. I also like the fact that it's made in the USA.
B0000DI84D This adjustable flower pot is very easy to use. Just attach the L shaped brackets depending on the width of what you are hanging it on. It is best on something like a deck railing as the top of this will be about level with the top of the railing so most what you will see is the plant. It could be used on a fence too but may be a bit too high.
B0000DI84D This is well made, functional, easy to install, and seemingly durable.  It was a perfect addition to our deck.  We love the way it looks and are very happy with the quality and design.
B0000DI84D I really like this Flower Pot Holder.  It fits great on the railing that leads down my back steps.  It was quick and easy to set-up and it's a really nice quality.  It holds my flower pots really well.  It's nice, simple & basic.Having just one of these seems odd.  I would definitely recommend getting yourself a set.  I think they would look better if you had 2 spaced out just a little bit from each other.I like this Flower Pot Holder and I would recommend it.
B0000DI84D Cobra's 10-inch adjustable flower pot works well for those who would like a pot that can mount to their deck or patio railing and hold a pot up to 10-inches in diameter at the top (and 7 inches in diameter at the base). The adjustable railing brackets have screw/bolt combinations that will accommodate railing widths between 2 and 6 inches. The pot is simple to adjust, install, and use. It will accommodate plastic, wood, metal, or clay pots as long as the dimensions are correct. The neutral black color works well anywhere.
B0000DI84D On the product label it says this pot holder is \"for decks, balconies and fences\".  The planter has U shaped brackets that are designed to slip over a flat 2x4 or 4x4 or 2x6 railing, but this design doesn't work on a privacy fence.  My fence has no top mounted 2x4 so there is no place to hook the bracket.  I even tried screwing the brackets into the fence's 4x4 post, but the pot's brackets are 4 1/2\" apart so that didn't work either.In the end I just hung the pot on the wooden support of glider/swing that I have on the patio.  Not exactly where I wanted the pot holder, but an okay place I guess.
B0000DI84D I am thoroughly enjoying this plant holder.  It fits perfectly over our metal balcony railing in our rental.  Only time will tell is there will any rusting and peeling issues as I have encountered before with products of this nature.
B0000DINGG Bought this to catch a little mouse that's taken up residence in our garage.  Didn't even know he was THERE until I put a plant that needed repotting out in the garage for a day till I could get around to repotting it.  The next day, my plant was GONE (eaten) and there was dirt on the floor from the animal's digging.What to do?  NO WAY am I going to set a conventional mousetrap and kill a mouse and then empty the trap.  Nope. Not happening.I remembered seeing these at Amazon & ordered it.  Set the trap the day after I got it & CAUGHT the little guy within about 4 hours of setting it (I checked the trap hourly; used 2 kibbles of dry cat food for bait).He was pretty nervous, so I covered the trap with a paper towel while I carried him out to a hedgerow, where I set him free (instructions said to minimize human contact so as to not stress the animal--I agree).  Having read another reviewer's experience of a frightened mouse running up their arm, I planned ahead & put the trap in the hedgerow, on the ground, pointed so that no matter which direction he ran, it wouldn't be toward me.  Then I just took off the paper towel & pressed down on the main trigger so both doors opened simultaneously.  My little guy cautiously poked his nose out of the trap, took a couple of sniffs of air, & bolted like a shot.Trap quality is excellent and it's very easy to set, once you get the \"hang\" of it.  Just press down on the main trigger arm, make sure your 2 locking arms for the doors are positioned at the tops of the doors, bait the pivoting bait bar inside, then position the \"baiting bar\" over your \"main trigger\" bars.  Easier than it sounds; you'll get printed instructions & photos in the box.Highly recommended!  And it will make you feel good to use a compassionate solution to your mouse problem.Have a question?  Leave a comment & I'll be happy to help you if I can.---------------------------UPDATE 9/22/13 Evening:  Uh-oh.  On a lark, I re-set the trap this afternoon.  Just checked it 10 minutes ago.  I caught ANOTHER one (smaller).  Let her go & set the trap AGAIN.  How many might we have?  We'll see...UPDATED UPDATE 9/24/13:  OK.  I did not know we had mice in the garage. Thanks to this trap, I've caught and released FOUR (Mama, Papa, & 2 cute babies).  The trap's been set all day today & no takers, so maybe that was the extent of the family. I've learned one other tip:  set the trap during the DAY so you can release during DAYLIGHT.  Unless you don't mind setting mice free IN THE DARK.  Personally, I can't bear to leave them caged once I've caught them, so I like to release as soon as they're caught. GREAT SYSTEM; most highly recommended for its utility and ease of use!UPDATE #3 10/12/13:  GUESS WHAT?  Mice can run LOTS faster than humans can walk.  I'd re-set the trap yesterday afternoon & didn't catch anything.  Till 10:30 at NIGHT.  Remember my advice about not setting the trap after dark?  I didn't (remember).  I should have sprung the trap at dark.  But I didn't.  So when I did one last check of the trap last night---SURPRISE!---I caught another one!  And since it was late and very dark, I decided to just let him go in the front yard.  Oops.  He ran through the yard, down the driveway, and back into the garage before I could walk even 5 paces.  Learn from me : )  DON'T DO THAT. Because, now I have to deal with a EDUCATED MOUSE.  One who, having returned to the garage, now realizes the trap is a TRAP.  I may have to upgrade my bait; time will tell : )I still most highly recommend this mouse trap--it works!
B0000DINGG I bought this simply because of the reputation Havahart has. The other Havahart traps I own, like the 1025, is of top quality and made to last a lifetime. When comparing the two, it's as though they weren't even built by the same company.  This model is simply a joke. The sides are so uneven I had to bend them in so that the doors would close without leaving a gaping escape hole. I also had to bend the hatch bars because they would not fall into the fasteners when the hatch was triggered. I did catch one mouse, but without my straightening of the unit it would not have even been functional. (Note to owners...you really need to read the instructions on how to adjust the sensitivity before you say it doesn't work.) That makes this unit NOT ready to use right out of the box.Other notes...There is no handle so you must be careful how you handle it so you don't get bit by the rodent. The top corners are also razor sharp and you need to be careful not to get stabbed. The corners should have been rounded off for the extra $.10 in cost.It is important to note that all traps must be cleaned with with bleach and then soap after a catch. The urine and feces detracts other animals since they consider the trap \"marked\". Based on that point, it is also important to know that cleaning this unit is painful as the windows are unfinished and act as a cheese grader on your hands. Once again, a few pennies should have been spent to finish off the rough edgesHavahart's build quality with this model is pretty disgraceful. I wish the company would have thought twice before they permitted this cost-cutting AND let their quality control go down the drain.
B0000DINGG I've owned six different types of rodent traps. This one has been the most consistent. It has even caught two birds! (birds were surprised, but uninjured and released healthy) We have have many species of rodents around our house, but only two create a health problem or damage problem.  This trap humanely captures all of them, and allows us to release the non-harmful rodents uninjured.  The harmful rodents can then be euthanized humanely. This is the most humane and effective process for small animals I've found so far. Yes, the trap can trip from strong winds, and yes it can be tripped without a catch. It's also a one-shot deal so you get one animal per setting. We can live with this - nothing is perfect. The trap can be a little frustrating to set if you've had too much coffee as well, but you get the hang of it.Update 7/10/12Be careful not to get the \"Grips\" livetrap which is a knock off of Havahart. The trigger wire does not have a flat spot which makes it very difficult to set and it trips without trapping frequently. Grips also appears to fall apart easily.  The Havaharts have been catching mice, voles, chipmunks and ground squirrels more effectively than any other trap.  Is also completely humane. We're only after the mice and voles (they damage things) so we let the others go without injury. CHECK YOUR TRAPS OFTEN or these become quite IN-humane.
B0000DINGG We left a bag of cat food in the garage a few weeks ago and when we went to use it, found a hole in the bag and clear evidence around the bag that a mouse had done the deed (think about that one for a minute and you'll know what I mean).We bought this trap and caught one mouse the first night and a second mouse the day after. We used peanut butter as our bait and it seemed to do the trick.Getting my hand inside to bait the trap was a tight fit (it's a small trap). Plus, the trap triggers easily so getting it right the first time was impossible - every time I put it down, it triggered itself. It took a few tries but eventually, I was able to set it and put it down on the garage floor without the doors slamming shut.Getting the mouse out was another challenge. First, a mouse poops a lot and since they can't get a hall pass and use the restroom, well, it's pretty unappealing to have to deal with the trap. I put the trap in a box, hauled it to the woods and shook the mouse out - uninjured, of course.Cleaning out the trap was the final step - I hosed it out with a garden hose.It's a simple, cheap and humane way to catch and remove a pest. It is a bit tricky to set and bait but the end result is a live mouse outside the garage. Win/Win!
B0000DINGG Havahart 1020 - Small rodentsI have a larger Havahart from about 20-25 years ago that works to this day and is able to catch squirrels without any difficulty. The wire mesh on that model is too big for small field mice, so I bought this 1020 to hopefully catch some of these smaller mice and rats. They tend to crawl into my engine compartment and store seeds or other rubbish.The 1020 is quite small and light weight. Its construction isn't very good, everything seems thinner and lighter than the older design. The bait tray is easily sprung. A gust of wind will set it off, and it renders it useless in windy conditions outside. Understandably, a field mouse is going to be quite light so a heavier trap may not spring when the mouse touches the tray. Unfortunately, this also makes the 1020 very touchy. I recommend using it indoors or in a covered area close to the suspected location of the critters.Overall: 4/5 stars, the construction could be better, but time will tell
B0000DINGG These work perfecctly - they are a bit sensitive to set but these are trapping at least a mouse a day in my garage.
B0000DINGG After months of battling a pesky mouse situation we actually NAMED our lil wild friend after he dashed across my foot one night during a trip to the bathroom...!! This trap succeeded in humanely capturing one Mr. Bo Jangles so he could be relocated to a nearby field!!After reading numerous reviews of various humane traps here on Amazon, I finally settled on this trap and the metal 12 catch mousetrapJ.T. EATON 421CL \"REPEATER\" MULTIPLE CATCH MOUSE TRAP.  I'll admit, once these traps arrived I was really impressed with the multi-catch trap which APPEARS to a very awesome trap and was VERY easy to bait! Mr. Bo Jangles never ventured anywhere near the multi-catch trap,, perhaps the strong stench of machine oil present... thankfully the Havahart trap did not have the offensive odor.  Additionally I had to modify the Multi-catch trap as it would have easily released any entrapped mouse with a simple nose press on the upper lid...The Havaheart trap looked weak and appeared difficult to set, I seriously had doubts initially.  I admit I played with the trap awhile and made a number of minor adjustments to the trap before baiting it with a piece of Granola Bar which I \"glued\" to the bait table with a nice chunk of peanut butter.  Once baited, I found a quiet closet in which Bo Jangles had previously been spotted and set it in the middle of the closet floor. AFTER setting the trap in place and being sure this was \"the place\" did I attempt to actually set the previously baited trap.I gave this Havahart trap a 5 star rating despite the written instructions being less than ideal since it caught our lil friend in less than a week.  Just play with the trap awhile and understand how it works before relying on it to catch your mice.  Also understand that it may need a few minor adjustments due to being bounced around in shipping.I wish to thank the Reviewer who provided sane advice for a wise method for releasing the trapped mouse.  As a reminder, when releasing the mouse open the door that is AWAY from you!!  In our case, I took the trap to a local field along with a reliable stick.  I set the trap in the field and used the stick to gently remove the door lock of the door AWAY from me thereby allowing the mouse to nose his way through door.  Using the stick I had to gently move the trap over on the side to allow the mouse an easier time of releasing itself from the trap but at least I didn't have a mouse running up my coat sleeve!! ;-)
B0000DINGG I previously rated the Kness Tip Trap, so there is more info.there.  This trap looks good and should work, but it didn't catch any mice.  Setting the trap doors is a little tricky.
B0000DINGG I've had success corralling the little buggers with the two-dollar Tip Trap and the pricier Smart Mouse House, but they catch only one mouse at a time, and I have yet to find a plastic trap that, after the 3rd or 4th use, the critter hasn't gnawed his way out of (my mice chew through plastic like it was cheese).  On the other hand, this Havahart device frankly befuddles me (maybe the mouse as well).  If I had a couple of hours to devote to it, I might be to figure out how to set the matrix of wires \"just so\" for both ends of the trap to spring shut (why 2 ends?).  I've got enough time to take the little creatures on Sunday drives into the country, but getting the hang of this gadget is beyond my skills and/or patience.  If you consider yourself a \"pro\" with a heart, maybe this'll pan out.  I'm returning mine and going with another fragile, plastic green \"crack house.\"  (It works quite well for the first 2-3 weeks, before the mouse has ripped it to shreds.)
B0000DINGG I have a couple of the larger Havahart traps and swear by them.  Those are solid, well-built, and foolproof.  This model is exactly the same as their larger 2-door trap, just shrunk down.  Unfortunately, everything fits together very loosely, which makes it tricky to set the trap, and much too easy to trip.  The \"U\"-shaped bars which lock the doors down have a tendency to fall out.  The long bars attached to the doors, which hook to the trigger, also fit very loosely.  Setting the bars onto the trigger involves taking two cylindrical pieces of metal, about the size and shape of the point of a ball-point pen, and balancing one on top of the other.  This is trickier than it should be, and the slightest jar will trigger the trap.  It helps if you take a large pliers, or set of channel locks, and flatten the ends a bit so they will stay mated better.  A strong wind can set this off, and a storm certainly will, making these unsuitable for outdoor use.  Note also that a man-size hand won't fit inside this trap, so you will have to carefully toss the bait in and hope it lands on the trigger, or keep trying until it does.  There is no handle, so you need to be careful about where you hold a filled trap to avoid getting bit.  You can make these work inside, but be prepared for some aggravation.  Overall a disappointing product.
B0000DINGG This trap worked great and caught the mouse the first night I put it out. I was then able to release it easily in a nearby field. I have tried many other catch and release traps and the Havahart models seem to always work the best for me. I have used them to catch mostly mice and voles, but I would imagine they all work just as good for catch and release pest control.
B0000VUNBA I just bought an emergency back-up generator.  It's just like a snow thrower.  It you buy it, you probably will never need it and it becomes another gas-fired device that needs maintenance.  Unfortunately, we need both.  Ocassional power outages and significant snow storms here in Maryland do happen.  Even though we hopefully will never have another 40&#34; monster storm like the one a few winters ago, we do have frequent violent storms enough to justify the generator and I just about wore out my snow thrower on that one storm alone.  I think we're do for more.  Hence the generator cover.
B0000VUNBA Bought this for my 10KW Generac portable generator, and it does the job. Covers the engine and generator, and if you're patient, you can even leave the handles exposed through the corner slits in the cover. Seems adequately strong with well-sewn seams - should last a long time, and it'll keep my generator warm and dry over the winter.Definitely recommended for any large portable generator.
B0000VUNBA This generator cover is superb in every fashion.  It fits my largest generator; easy on and off.  I will be purchasing another for second generator in a different State.
B0000VUNBA My fault, I should have ordered the next size up. The description was not that accurate.The openings for the generator handles leave much space for snow to pass through.
B0000VUNBA Fits the champion 41135 generator just fine and seems like its good quality and will last through weather and storms.
B0000VUNBA The cover is thin and not as durable as it looks in the photo or as described 'heavy duty'.  There are two holes for the handles if your generator has one.  Not totally comfortable putting the generator outside or even covered shed.  Better to leave it in closed shed.
B0000VUNBA This thing covers my generator just fine. It shows no sign of wear or coming apart after using it for months.
B00013BUW8 The storage seat comes as six heavy duty plastic panels that snap together.  Once assembled it is strong and sturdy.  The lid/seat is hinged and overlaps the box so rain is kept out.  The bottom is raised on short legs which also helps keep out moisture.We use it to hold a large bag of charcoal, lighter fluid, and a small fire extinguisher.  All the things necessary for a successful barbecue.UPDATE 7/8/11 - Over a year later and the storage seat is still going strong.  One thing has changed though.  We've gave up using lighter fluid and are instead using aWeber 87886 Chimney Starter.  It works perfectly and there's no \"lighter fluid\" smell.UPDATE 10/25/26 - A few more summers past and the storage seat continues to do it's job.  In fact, our first few barbecues each spring use the charcoal that's been outside sitting in and protected by the seat all winter with no problems.BTW, I feel that honest, effective reviews take the place of first-hand experiences that are lacking in online shopping. I've always appreciated the help I've gotten from other reviewers and continue to return the favor as best as I can.
B00013BUW8 I use it on my front porch for my deliveries. works perfect. if it gets dirty, a little rince from the hose and all is good.
B00013BUW8 When I was looking for a nice storage box for my front porch -- I ordered this product based on the other reviews.  They were right!  It WAS easy to put together.  Less than 2 minutes, no tools, no kidding.  It's very sturdy and doubles as overflow seating when necessary.  Very handy.  I even went back and ordered the larger one.  One note on the color:  It's more of a light taupe than the whiteish tone you see in the picture.  No matter. I highly recommend it.
B00013BUW8 It took all of 5 minutes to assemble except for the top. That took about 4 more minutes to figure out. This product literally snaps together - no tools needed except for the top which they claim just snaps on like the other pieces. Maybe if your a body builder you have the strength to bend the tab by hand but I couldn't.There is a simple solution - after sliding the right side hinge into place - use a medium sized flat blade screw-driver inserted between the tab and the hinge and carefully bend the hinge back toward the right and slide the hinge over the tab and your done.I doubt that if left out in a heavy rain-it would be water tight - but that is not an issue for me since I am using it to store ceramic & stainless steel accessories for my Ceramic Egg Grill/Smoker.
B00013BUW8 This came screamingly fast, and I don't even use the two day shipping option.  I put it together in about five minutes, after I figured out how to attach the lid.  It seems fairly sturdy, but I'm about 175 pounds, and I'm not sure about sitting on it, but I put a cushion on top, and the cat will probably sleep there.  Some time ago I purchased a larger patio storage container which my husband immediately took over for storing the pool chemicals.  This made me reluctant to store the patio cushions in it, which was the reason that I had purchased it.  Recently Amazon put this one on sale with with super saver shipping.  My husband liked the idea of having this container solely for the pool chemicals, and so did I.  This one will hold a large tub of chlorine tablets, plus two half gallon containers that hold liquid, and his pool testing box, with room to spare. I now have the larger one back for my cushions and pool floats, so everyone is happy.  August 28, 2007 postscript:  I put a cushion on this, and my husband, who weighs 205 pounds, sat on this without causing a problem, so it's more sturdy than I thought.
B00013BUW8 This is a really easy to assemble box that is just right for my gardening supplies. We have it on the front balcony of our floating home. It looks just fine and doesn't detract from the look of the front of our house, which is in a high traffic tourist area so we try to keep it looking nice. So far it's been rain proof and has worked out really well. I recommend it for anyone needing a bit of storage in a smaller outdoor space.
B00013BUW8 Makes a great little seat, keeps the contents dry. I store a 5gal bucket in here with my grilling tools and it fits perfectly with some room to the side for other stuff. This is great for us on our small balcony since it is both a seat and storage. It is sturdy enough to stand on, and it keeps the weather out well. Great value!
B00013BUW8 I use this to keep some gardening tools and a soccer ball in for easy access. Works well, and supports my 250lbs just fine as well. Keeps contents dry so far.
B00013BUW8 I bought this storage product to keep rock salt in this winter. It arrived today and I had it assembled in just a few minutes. Although they say no tools are necessary for assembly, and while it might be true for a strong man who can get that second hinge to seat properly, it wasn't true for me. I had to use a flat-head screwdriver to pry the final hook over far enough so it could snap back and catch the hinge (when you have the instructions in front of you, you'll know what I mean). It was no big deal to do that. I just want to point out that weaker people may need to resort to using a prying tool.The storage bin seems to be well-engineered for easy assembly (other than that one pesky hinge!) and ideal for standing up to whatever weather Mother Nature dishes out. For me, it arrived just in time because later tonight I'll be outside shoveling the walks and then putting down salt.Bottom line: It's nice to find an economical product that does what it's supposed to do, especially when it also manages not to be an eyesore.Update a year or so later: The lid has developed a bit of a warp or twist making it unable to close fully (there's a narrow strip of empty space when the lid is down, showing that it isn't all the way down where it needs to be to rest on the edge of the container). For my use, that's not a big deal, but it would have been better if that change hadn't taken place. For that reason, I'm taking a star off what was originally a 5-star review.
B00013BUW8 I bought this to store bird seeds on the front porch. It's the perfect size to hold a variety of seeds with room for suet cakes and hummingbird nectar. The piece snaps together easily but securely. You may need a rubber mallet to get the top on but it's worth it. The best part ... it's made in the U.S.
B00013BUW8 I bought a Suncast SS1000 Storage Seat to place out back to hold the bags of dog treats I always have out there. I had considered getting a plastic storage bin to keep birds and rain out of the treats but this is a much nicer solution!It's roomy enough to hold at least three 5 to 10 lb bags of dog biscuits, and it keeps them nice and dry and safe from other critters.It require no tools to assemble, and went together in less than a minute. The lid is hinged and lifts easily, and when closed it slightly overlaps the base to keep rain out.I have a Suncast deck box which has stood up to the elements for a couple years now and still looks great (no easy trick here in the Arizona desert) so there's no doubt this storage seat will do the same.Although I use mine for dog treats, you could easily use it to store garden tools, a hose, toys, pool supplies, or anything you'd like.I'm pleased with it and give it two thumbs up.
B0001AUF8G We try to keep unused containers stored upside down to prevent standing water that leads to mosquitoes breeding.However, my garden area consists of raised beds and earthboxes around the perimeter.  The earthboxes have reservoirs that hold water and mosquitoes often breed in them, leading to a garden full of mosquitoes.It really helps to drop some Mosquito Bits into the fill tube of each earthbox during the season.  I have a few other large containers that have attached saucers that fill with water.  They get some bits added too.This product works well.  A container lasts for quite awhile and makes it much easier to be in the garden and yard.
B0001AUF8G To be honest, I actually purchased this product for fungus gnats in my houseplants from the potting soil and not for mosquitoes outside.  I've been using a product called Gnatrol -Gnatrol WDG - 60 grams(which Amazon used to sell) but ran out of it. Needing a quick fix, it's commonly known that mosquito dunks/pellets contain the same active ingredient in Gnatrol (the BTI bacteria).I bought this because my herb garden I started had an infestation from a newly purchased bag of potting soil. From the herb garden, the infestation of gnats slowly started migrating to my other houseplants. I thought I could take care of them all with this product, but the warnings on the package says to keep away from food sources and to not ingest it. So using it on my herb garden was a chance I didn't want to take.I ended up using this just for my house plants and I can attest the fact that it does work on killing fungus gnat larva. However, the reason I give it 4 stars is because you can't use it on indoor edible plants (like my herb garden).Luckily, Amazon started selling Gnatrol again so I ended up buying another container (which is actually safe for vegetables/crops/edibles). So now rather than using all my gnatrol on vegetables/herbs/houseplants alike, I can save money by using Gnatrol on my edibles and these mosquito bits on my decorative houseplants.
B0001AUF8G We have skeeters terrible down here in Texas. When it rains sometimes we get these standing water holes and I sprinkle this in them and it seems to help. Non toxic makes it the only way to go as well.
B0001AUF8G I'm on my 3rd bottle of this in the last four years.  It works very well.  I can treat standing water in a variety of scenarios.  Dosage is dependent on surface area not volume of water.  The active ingredient is toxic only to mosquito larvae so pets and wildlife are unaffected.  I collect a lot of rainwater and couldn't do without this product, now.
B0001AUF8G I've used these for years in water gardens around my yard and they work very well and do not hurt the birds or any other animal as far as I can tell.  If you look into a water feature and see something wriggling that look like small shrimp, you need these as those are mosquito larva.
B0001AUF8G I have a lot of aquatic plants outside and was worried about the pots becoming a mosquito breeding ground.  I sprinkled this in the pots and haven't seen any little squirmies.  The bits are the best way for me too go as I didn't need a whole &#34;dunk&#34; for each pot and that would end up being expensive.  I also sprinkled these bits in an area where I found some water had leaked leaving a temporary swamp.  No skeeters there either.
B0001AUF8G Not what I expected.  This is to be added in sitting water.  My mistake.  I thought it was a dry type of killer feed.
B0001AUF8G This is one of many products in our arsenal to keep the nasty biters in control.  We reapply every couple of weeks or after a typical TX. downpour into drains, wet areas in our yard.  Even when we run the sprinkler system, it's still lasts a couple of weeks-and you don't need to use alot. It works really well.
B0001IOYX0 Although I have read reviews about woman appreciating the size, as a man I also have small hand. Although I usually work with much larger tools, it is great to have pruners that fit exactly in my hands. These pruners are light which means I can now work for a longer period without hand fatigue. And lastly these are professional, well made, \"last for life\" pruners.
B0001IOYX0 First off, these cut WAY better than any other shears I own.  Friskars seem like children's safety scissors by comparison.  They cut through dead thick woody canes with ridiculous ease.  My only complaint is that they are meant for small MENS hands, not women's hands.I have average sized lady's hands.  Typical caucasian size, I guess size small glove and a size 5 ring. These clippers are still almost too big to keep a grip on when you open the blades.  Essentially, if you hold your hands as if to grip imaginary clippers, as wide as you can, if this gap measures less than 4&#34;, there is no way you're going to be able to open/close these clippers fully with gloves on.  They barely fit my hands bare, and with gardening gloves, I have to adjust my grip so my middle, longer, finger is doing the closing action.  My index finger is too short to wrap around the handle without sliding off.  The handles are not especially grippy, they're smooth rubber.  So, unless they are small enough for your fingers to really wrap around them solidly, you will have to adjust your grip awkwardly.
B0001IOYX0 I returned this pruner. The latch is very difficult to turn. Once open, the pruner works smoothly. I'm a small-ish man and I found the grip comfortable enough. But - I bought a Fiskar pruner for half the price and it works fine. It seems made for two grip positions, depending on whether you have large or small hands. Any, this is probably a good, albeit expensive, pruner - if you want to spend the afternoon with WD-40 working the latch loose.
B0001IOYX0 After 50 years of gardening I have yet to find better quality pruners. This model is great for small or arthritic hands. Very sharp. All parts replaceable although not inexpensive.
B0001IOYX0 I have owned and used dozens of pruners, some cheap, some expensive, but none better than my Felco pruners!  Actually, by spending a bit more I have saved quite a lot of money.  My first pairs were my grandmothers.  I have no idea how old they were but it must have been over twenty five years.  They were as good as new.  I live in a house in the country and we keep almost seven acres park-like with flower gardens, fruit trees, grapes and the like.  It is a very large task keeping this place up between the two of us.  I did purchase the F-6 as my hands are rather small; strong, but alas small and I found these to fit them better.  My old set from my grandmother are larger and after several hours do tire my hands.These are well made and perfectly balanced and their cutting power is tremendous.  I have owned several of the cheap pruners and they last maybe one season.  I have no doubt that I will be using this new pair for quite a number of years to come.  As has been pointed out in other review, there are a lot of look-a-likes available and are quite inexpensive.  Don't be taken by this.  Look for the brand and go ahead and spend the extra dollars.  They are worth every penny and will save money in the long run.I am, I promise you, extremely picky about my gardening tools and yard care tools.  I put them to work!  I have been more than satisfied with these pruners and have no doubt that I will purchase another if the need should ever arise.
B0001LEPYA For every soil sample I tested this powder with, it indicated it was 7.5 ph.  I even tried some of my almost pure peat mix in it and it said it was 7.5, which is the highest the meter will go so I'm assuming it's just bad powder.  I tested the same soil in the other compartment with my liquid ph tester (also bought on here, good stuff), and it showed the real PH values (5.0 for my peat mix), 6.5 for my other regular soil.  So it gets to keep a star because I'll use the container for testing with my liquid ph tester.
B0001LEPYA I bought this to test the pH of my blueberry soil that I have in half wine barrels. I used 1/3 pine bark mulch, 1/3 sphagnum peat moss, and 1/3 organic potting soil. I mixed it all up well and checked the pH a few weeks later. This quick little kit gave me indication I was at around a 6. I wanted to drop it a bit further so I added some organic acid fertilizer, waited close to 2 months and rechecked. My soil is now around 4.5 to 5. The blueberry bushes love it and they are green (not red and yellow now), growing fast, and have tons of flowers!+ Water Dropper Included+ Simple Instructions+ No Mess+ Consistent Results+ Takes about 2-3 minutes to take a sample and get a reading+ Small Booklet providing details of many different plants, vegetables, and flowers and the soil pH they grow best in_Bottom Line_ Yes, I would recommend this pH kit over other products, such as a soil probe. In my experience this is the fastest, most consistent, easiest way to get an accurate idea of what the pH is. This kit really helped me get my blueberry bushes up and going and I will continue to use the test kit to monitor my soil pH.
B0001LEPYA Soil from different areas of the yard test a bit differently, and I got repeat results. This would indicate the tests are at least consistent and sensitive enough to be of use. I'm happy to at least have a good idea of the soil and don't have to worry that it is way off. Since a couple of fruit trees were not so hot, I wondered about that. As it turns out, all my areas are a bit acidic, so I amended the soil and hope for good results.What people say about the small capsules is true. Pretty darn tiny and probably very difficult for many people to use without spilling. What would bigger capsules cost?  Nothing probably.Five stars if it would also kill gophers and weeds.
B0001LEPYA Inexpensive, this kit consists of ten single use tablets.  Instructions are clear and the contents -- a vial, ten test tablets and an eye dropper for water -- are well-designed.  For the price, it provided me peace of mind on my growing conditions and prevented me from pH conditioning the soil where it did not need conditioning.On the downside, readings are not precise.  You'll get a good idea of the general soil pH within a .5 reading, but nothing specific.  That's probably okay, however.  Most times soil conditions are not exact from place to place anyhow and a general idea is what most of us need.
B0001LEPYA It's not a difficult task to assess your soil type.  Just moistening it and checking out how it molds and feels in your hands will easily tell you whether it is sandy, silty, or clay-like.  However, you can't check out its pH level of acidity or alkalinity just by looking at it or holding it in your hands.  For example, if you are planning a strawberry bed, an optimal pH level would be 6.0 to 7.0.  On the other hand if you want carrots, an optimal pH level would be 5.0 to 6.0.The rapitest pH soil tester is not unlike many others on the market, but is a good one.  It comes with ten pH capsules, a dropper, full directions as to how to use them (very simple), and  a color chart to compare your results.  The pH level chart ranges from pH level 4.5 (very acid) to pH 7.5 (alkaline).When you test your soil, make sure that you use distilled water as tap water can skew your results.  This little kit is quick and easy and will help you decide not only what to plant in a particular location, what nutrients you need to add to the soil according to the pH, and enable you to gauge the health of your plants throughout the growing season.  The best time to use this inexpensive kit would be in the spring and after harvest time.
B0001LEPYA It is a very simple yet effective test when someone needs to know the ph of soil (outside for the most part).The ONLY CON i have with this test is the pill capsules filled with the reactive powder which in the end is the catalyst for the color. You do need ph'd water or a very distilled water to test your soil with. If you use tap, you are taking the chance of an off reading due to the ph of your tap water. For the price and complexity it is well worth it. Not a perfect 5 stars but 4 is an understatement.
B0001LEPYA No only is this little soil pH tester include easy to follow and use instructions, but it also includes a fantastic guide for what pH level is ideal for growing a vast list of vegetables, flowers, trees, shrubs and grasses. I love this guide so much I'm laminating it! This tester has been priceless for preparing my raised vegetable beds and getting the pH just right for each bed's corresponding planting.
B0001LEPYA I had been using this kit til I looked on amazon for refills and found none. I didn't want to buy another kit so I researched test strips. The test strips work the same and are waaay cheaper. I'm using my container that came in this kit but a cup to mix soil and water in would work just fine.
B0001LEPYA It works and is more reliable than a test probe thingy provided you follow the instructions. These have been the standard for years and you can't go wrong if you do it right. This can mean three tests per area to be tested but you will know for sure. It only tests PH. If you want to know more get a more complex test.Robs Rating:Fiddly but it works.
B0001Q2EMA I love this hedge trimmer!  I have a fair number of bushes and hedges that need trimming, but always hated having to trim them mainly becuase of the tools.  I had a corded model (also a B&D;) that cut very well, but the cord was always a real pain -- it always got snagged on something, and I ended up spending more time dealing with the cord than actually trimming. Looked into a gas model, but the weight was an issue, as well as the noise.The cordless B&D; is a fantastic tool! It lets you concentrate on the trimming. Ready to go in a second (no cord to unwind and plug in) and the battery lasts a decent interval. No, it's not an everlasting battery that will run for hours, but that's an easy problem to solve -- just get a second battery so if the first one gives up before you're done, you just pop in another.Nicely balanced and easy to handle. Highly recommend!!
B0001Q2EMA Great product!!  Works great. I have trimmed many hedges with this little machine, and it holds it's charge throughout the job. Not too heavy, and easy to maneuver. Very pleased I bought it.
B0001Q2EMA This cordless trimmer has plenty of power and makes short work of bushes and shrubs around my house.  Uses the same 18V battery as my B&D; drill, so it's nice to have a spare if I need it.  First time I used it, I went out planning to spend 5 minutes or so trying it out.  Instead, I was outside over 45 minutes and got most of my trimming done.  I've never used a corded trimmer, but I can imagine how much trouble it would be to deal with the cord.  This is quick and easy.I think the main thing about a battery operated hedge trimmer is that you need to take care of the battery.  Keep the battery in a moderate temperature environment (don't leave it in your freezing garage or storage building), and keep it charged.  If the trimmer doesn't run for long right out of the box, you probably have a defective battery.
B0001Q2EMA I don't have a lot of hedges but I'm pretty sure one battery could get thru most tract-home sized yards with no problem.  It cuts well, light & easy to use, isn't terrible on battery use.  I've had this a couple years, still no problems at all.
B0001Q2EMA I bought the B&D Cordless Hedge trimmer a few weeks ago based on the comments made by the people here in the reviews.  I am very pleased with my purchase. I found the power to be adequate for trimming shrubs around the yard. I didn't find the weight a problem as did some who reviewed it. The safety lock is an inconvenience. As some did, I fixed it to where it would stay in the locked position. It makes a big difference. Time will tell how the batteries will hold up. So far I have no complaints. I would recommend this trimmer
B0001Q2EMA Makes the job a lot easier. Used to have to run 100' of extension cord from the garage then wrestle it around like an Anaconda all over the yard. Cord would come unplugged and I had to constantly be on my toes to not cut across the cord.Cuts a nice even line right where I want it and it has reduced the time I spend messing with yard work.
B0001Q2EMK I've been using the cordless broom since April and am very pleased with it. In the past, after mowing I would drag out a broom to sweep and clean up the sidewalk. It also serves to clean off grass and leaves from my mower...again I had used a broom on that too. I keep the batteries at the ready and so far haven't needed both during one session, but like knowing I have a back up. It has really been a big help.
B0001Q2EMK I love this little blower!  I can grab it at a moment's notice and blow the leaves, pine needles, and other debris out of my courtyard.  SOOO much easier than dragging out the corded electric blower for quick light jobs!  Fits my \"girl hands\" nicely, not too heavy, not too noisy, lasts about 15 minutes.  For the big jobs, I'll still get out the \"monster\" electric blower that works like a hurricane coming through, but with this little guy I find myself blowing leaves and stuff frequently now, instead of dreading getting out the big one for a small job.  I'm going to look at the other items they make that uses the same battery pack too.
B0001Q2EMK I know most will not believe this and it is likely Black & Decker may not either but prior to owning this Electric Broom or smooth surface sweeper as it is called I owned the B & D Sweepstick you may never have seen one but it was a surface blower unit not much noise but good clearing action. The batteries were not renewable all was built in and you simply plugged one end of the charger to a wall recepticle and the other end into the tool and kept it there  when not in use. That Sweepstick lasted for over 20 years I don'r have to worry about this one lasting that long cause I won't but the new one I just purchased does as well as the last one I had  and that is all I can ask for. It won't blow the shingles off the roof but is plenty strong enough for driveways,walkways, porches and decks. I use it for blowing out the garage as well and it has no problem doing all of this on one charged battery and has power to spare. I can and do handle the big blowers, string trimmers, chain saws and pole saws but I can say the Black & Decker folks have captured the market in light duty battery operated tools. No messing with gas and oil except to lubricate the blades and just plug and play or work. Thanks to Black & Decker for the tools and to Amazon.com for making them affordable to us older folks.Sincerely,Denny
B0001Q2EMK Purchased as part of the home care package this little blower is great for loose material on hard or semi hard surfaces. While it doesn't have the power of my 230 mph corded one, there is one application where it shines.Even on a low setting the \"high power\" blower will always blow mulch off the beds when trying to clean out leaves and grass from among the scrubs. Getting the cord through all the shrubs is no picnic either.Provided it's dry, this little guy gets in between the bush's, shrubs, plants without blowing all the bedding into the yard, saving a few hours of raking.
B0001Q2EMK I ordered this product to clean bird seed off my back porch. It works if held close to the seed but I don't recommend it. It takes a l o n g time to charge the battery and it does not hold the charge as long as I expected. It is too big for a \"sweeper\". I usually like B&D products but this one, not so much.
B0001Q2EMK I picked up a factory refurbished one of these at a Black & Decker outlet store for less than half the regular Amazon price. I think it's worth having around at that price (three Hamiltons), but I would be really disappointed if I had paid full price for this blower. It's just not that powerful, and the battery life is pretty short. However, it does have its uses, so it has earned a place in my garage.This \"sweeper\" (light-powered blower) is a snap to assemble and is very easy to use. It has two speeds -- on and off. I used it this afternoon to blow off the garage floor and front porch. It handled leaves and dust just fine, but it wasn't useful against cobwebs, which is really what I had hoped to use it for. I guess they are too sticky to be removed effectively by this, so I had to break out the old broom. Oh well.If you can get a good deal on one of these, go for it... especially if you have other Black and Decker products that use the same 18V battery. I have aBlack & Decker GrassHog String Trimmer/Edger(model NST2118), and having an extra battery and charger around for that is handy. But if you weren't already in the B&D; system, and were looking to pay full price, I wouldn't do it.The Black & Decker NS118 is made in China.
B0001Q2EMK This product used to include 2 batteries. But, B&D; has dropped it down to 1. The cost of each battery is around $30 to $35. I found the last one in my local Lowes store that still has 2 batteries. The blowing capability is low, but sufficient for hard surface. The blowing duration with a fresh charged battery is around 15 mins. It's convenient for quick job. I drop 1 point due to its limited power, I drop 1 more point because the included battery is dropped from 2 to 1.*************************************************************New updates....I bought it, tried it and returned it.After one month, I bought it again.....even it comes with 1 battery only.Yes, this cordless blower is weak to effectively blow leaves in the lawn, especially if the leaves are wet. But it indeed is quite capable in blowing leaves on hard surface (like the driveway).While I have no problem using other corded lawn tools, like mower, hedger trimmer, line trimmer, but I found it is very difficult to manuver my corded blower. Specifically, the cord itself is messing up the leaves while I am trying to pile up the leaves with the blower. So, cordless blower is the choice for blowing leaves around driveway, front entrance door. I still use the corded blower for leaves in the lawn due to its much stronger power.This cordless blower is very convenient and effective for light duty tasks like sweeping the driveway, front door area, backyard deck...This package comes with only 1 battery. That's sufficient for about 20 minutes blowing per each charge. So, plan your cleaning job to be done in 20 minutes, or to get a 2nd battery.
B0001Q2EMK I've had this electric broom for about a year. It lacks the power of a corded blower but nonetheless it does the job for me. I use it to clean up the sidewalk and driveway after mowing the lawn or after a windy period leaves a mess. It works great and I can do my front yard and back yard areas on a single battery charge.I wouldn't recommend this for blowing leaves off a lawn as it may not have enough force to make that job easy. I don't own another blower and don't expect to because I don't feel I need to. In the fall when our trees drop their leaves we rake them.We now have four B&D; tools that use the same type of 18V battery. All four batteries are constantly in their charging stations so are always ready for use in any of the four tools. This is a successful design that is flexible for our use.
B0001Q2EMK Still works same as when I first bought it.  It's not a high-powered blower, and it will go thru the battery pretty quick, but if you want to just grab a blower to blow off your patio or driveway without dealing with cords or anything this is great.  I've got a ton of concrete around my front and back yards and two batteries does the trick.  If for some reason I want something really high-powered I will pull out the old corded blower, but it's rare.  My common use is blowing off sidewalks after mowing the grass.
B0001Q2EMK I have another B&D; 18 V product, a tree pruner that only came with one battery.  Amazon has a pretty good price on the battery at 32 bucks, but then I saw this unit which comes with 2 batteries and another charger for 6 bucks more than the cost of two batteries!  So now I have two 18V tools and 3 batteries with 2 chargers so I'll never find myself running out of juice again!  Great Deal!Oh the blower is not advertised as a leaf blower, so don't expect the power of of corded or gas unit. But as others have noted it works great on the deck and patio with low noise and no smell of a gas engine.2010 update - it appears that B&D; now includes only one battery with this unit.  Perhaps they realized it was too good a deal or people were not buying the batteries alone.  That's a shame because I would NOT buy this unit with only one battery.  You need at least two to get any work done, run time is not great and of course worsens as the batteries age.
B0001Q2EMK I love these B&D products.  I have four items that take the same interchangeable battery.  I have the radio charger, and keep the radio plugged in, so the battery is always fully charged.  The broom does a good job keeping my sidewalk/driveway clean, especially after mowing.  It's just so easy to use.
B0001Q2EMK Will do the job of cleaning up after a day of cutting the lawn.Works best on smooth artificial surfaces like walkways, driveways, and garage floors. Will NOT help much with fall cleanup particularly on grass surfaces as it quickly loses power and is underpowered for this kind of work.
B0001Q2EMK You cannot compare this to a corded electric leaf blower, it isn't even marketed for that. It is a great replacement for a broom however and for that it works great.We have a 50 foot porch which is always in need of a sweep after even a light wind. Needles, leaves, pieces of cones always seem to make their way, it is a constant battle. Using a broom takes too much time to do everyday as is taking the time to get out the cord and electric blower which is overkill. This little blower works perfectly. So easy to use I just grab it and flip the switch. I can have the porch clean in about a minute. Works well for the patio and garage too. As a bonus I was recently surprised to find it worked well blowing the needles off our roof, another issue we have to deal with every summer.I have a couple of batteries. I always leave one in the charger, the batteries last a bit longer when I do.If you have a lot of sweeping to do this is a great tool!
B0001Q2EMK Works great although I can tell the battery power doesn't last as long as the trimmers, etc.  For my long driveway I usually bring a second battery along
B0001Q2EMK The purchase from Amazon was flawless; the trimmer was on by front porch within three days of the order placement. Amazing. Be careful opening the box. I got a nasty paper cut in my eagerness to rip off the box top with brute force. Inside the box everything was expertly packaged and protected with egg carton quality cardboard shell.Luckily operating the machine is simple because the direction sheet leaves much to be desired. It displays as many languages as a United Nations guide, but all in small print, all directions overly succinct. What you need to know is on the direction sheet but not necessarily easy to find because of a lack of clarity and organization.The small pictures provided require the use of a magnifying glass. The pictures aren't annotated with text, just numbered sequentially.In the YardWhen one buys a yard toy he doesn't really need, especially one that costs a hundred dollars, expectations and hopes are high. To this reviewer's relief, Black and Decker's cordless trimmer exceeds all expectations and far surpasses any preconceptions of performance and utility. Without clear directions I did have a bit of difficulty attaching the tool's handle, but after that little chore it was all uphill.So far this handy trimmer has performed flawlessly from one end of Spud Acres to its brother. On one charge I trimmed the front beds, the edges of the asphalt driveway, and most of the beds in the backyard. With extra batteries it's a snap to replace a spent battery with a fresh one. With the batteries included with my other Black and Decker cordless yard tools, and the Firestorm 18V battery bought recently, I have 6 batteries for the three tools. Even if a battery is attached to each tool, I still have two fresh batteries on standby on the chargers.RecommendationThis tool easily rates five stars. It's quieter than my other two trimmers, has more than adequate power for my needs, and is easy to maneuver. At first I thought that the pull down edge guide was a useless gimmick, but it actually works very well. Also the automatic line-feed feature is wonderfully convenient.NOTES - Be sure to remove tape from the line cutter and the spool. This bit of advice is not mentioned in the directions.I bought three spools of prewound line when I bought the trimmer, but learned from the directions that one can use bulk line to rearm an empty spool. I like the convenience of using spools ready to use.
B0001Q2EMK Easy to use cordless blower. Loved the fact that I do not have to grapple with cords while in the yard and it definitely beats using the scrapper broom to clear leaves off my front yard.However, it would be better if the battery was longer lasting as I find that I have to recharge after blowing just half my deck (which is probably a full deck for most houses).
B0001Q2EMK I have a few B&D; 18volt tools and I decided to buy a weed whacker and this electric broom.  I was in for a surprise.The weed whacker works great and the battery lasts for ever...as an FYI!I charged the battery the day I received it...a full charge of about 18 hours..to be on the safe side.  Put the battery in and went on to do my cleaning around the deck etc....  Yes there was air...it was OK..but not enough to sweep much.  15 minutes later it went to half power, and 10 minutes later it DIED.My first reaction - the battery is bad, lets try a different one and if that is the case I can call B&D; for a warranty replacement.  NOT the case...all batteries in this thing died in less then 30 minutes and thus this is useless for me.Other B&D; 18volt tools, including the weed whacker work for 45 minutes plus and usually have full power for the first 30 minutes.Sorry B&D; but this is useless, IMHO.  1/5
B0001Q2EMK This blower works well on hard surfaces and holds a decent charge. I use it only for blowing out the garage and walkways; easier to use and not get fumigated with a gas blower for small jobs. I have 2 other hard surface blowers, but this one is so much better; easier to hold and maneuver and blows harder than the others.
B0001Q2EMU Great little machine. For less than 100 bucks you get a trimmer that does a good job. Can be used as an edger also. I don't have large property but I can use this maybe 3 times before charge runs out. They give you two batteries with it and you can always have the backup charged and ready. Why mess with gasoline and mixing oil. Just turn this on and go. Very light weight and easy to manuever. Can adjust the height to suit your needs and no bumbing to advance the string. More convienent than gas or electric and not alot of money.
B0001Q2EMU No more dragging 200 feet of extension cord out when it's time to do some yard trimming. This thing is light weight, strong enough for moderate trimming, and no gas or cords to deal with. It's much like a cordless screwdriver or drill, use it, plug it back in...use it again. It's the ease of it all that makes it a winner. If you plan on taking down HEAVY brush etc...go for the cord, but for maintenance around the yard...this is it!
B0001Q2EMU I live in one of those communities that have common grounds which are kept up by a service; as a result, I only have to tend the grounds in and around my house.  I used to have to lug a power cord out to do it.  With this device, though, I can charge it up overnight and then bounce outside for perhaps 3 minutes of effort at the most.  You have not experienced convenience until you've had the luxury of no gas and pullcord startup or long troublesome power cord, just a battery powered tool.  It is definitely not for large estates, but for simple short jobs, it is perfect.
B0001Q2EMU I can not believe that I am using the same animal others have reviewed. I looked on the box to be sure. This is my third year and it is still working as well as the first time I tried it. I have a small lawn and what used to be reachable by mower is now only reachable by trimmer. With all the compost I use and other earthy products, the lawn has risen above the driveway and sidewalk. By using the \"Groom 'N' Edge\" button to rotate the trimmer head 180 degrees to convert the trimmer to an edger, I not only groom the lawn but also cut away the overflow dirt. Maybe this is why I seem to use more Black & Decker AF-100 String than the average reviewer. I think this thing will never fall apart; if it does I will go cordless.
B0001Q2EMU First of all, I love this trimmer. I have had it less than a year, so I can't comment on durability, but it is very light, and very easy to use.The handle adjusts for perfect balance. You can (and I often do) use this trimmer one-handed, then switch hands.This item is very light, very easy to use, and very quiet. No noise from a gas motor, no hassle of dragging around very long extension cords.The trimmer string advances automatically, so there's no need to mess around with the spool or tap the trimmer to advance the line.The head pivots so you can switch back and forth between edger and trimmer modes in seconds.I use this for edging, weed eating, and to cut grass on a steeply sloped portion of lawn.  It works great.When the battery is at full charge, this item has decent power. Shortly before the charge is gone, there is a sharp drop in power, which lets you know it's time to switch batteries and plug the one you're using into the battery charger. The unit comes with two batteries and one charger.My only complaint is that the batteries only hold a charge for about 15 minutes, after which it takes 9 hours to recharge them. The unit comes with two batteries and one charger. So you can do your front yard one morning, and your back yard the next, if you remember to swap out the battery being charged before you go to bed.If the unit came with four batteries and two chargers (or if the batteries held charges longer or took less time to recharge), this item would be perfect.Update after two years:  After one year, the batteries only last 5 minutes.  After a year and a half, they don't work at all.  Replacement batteries are very expensive.  The Black and Decker replacement battery I bought was better than the originals, but only holds a charge for a short period of time after a few months of use.  The third party NiMH (not NiCad) battery I bought has been the best of all, but it originally lasted 30 minutes and now is down to 15 or 20 after a few months of use.  The replacement battery charger I bought charges batteries in two to three hours instead of nine, but the two original batteries have died since I started using the new charger, and the replacement batteries are fading fast.I still like the trimmer a lot, but the batteries are so expensive, I will buy a different when these batteries die out.  I hope they last the rest of the year.
B0001Q2EMU I have been sold on Black & Decker for years I have a corded string trimmer that still works as good as new that is well over 20 years old the same can be said for half inch chuck corded drill well over 20 years for it and it is used often. I had a B&D sweep stick internal battery type that lasted 22 years and last month I bought the cordless pole saw and like it so much I decided to get the trimmer and once again have used it twice and very satisfied with its ability to get the job done. Since it is a single line trimmer and the smaller diameter line it would not be good in heavy thick weeds but ideal for grass trimming and very easy to handle it is a very well balanced tool and you cannot beat the price at Amazon and even better you get the extra battery. I can tell you a local big box store in our town which is well known around the world for cheap prices is asking $16 more for this same item and $40 for the batteries. If you want to look at it from my view point you are buying the batteries and getting the trimmer free.
B0001Q2EMU Here's my usage: 1 acre surrounded with chain link fence - and I have to do both sides; plus 200 feet of concrete driveway; three out-buildings; 16 trees, posts, etc.; another couple hundred feet of shrub beds.First - chain link fence and trimmers do not play nicely together. Prior to this trimmer, a trip through this yard with electric or gas meant several reels of line. With this trimmer - slightly more than one reel! I've had this for the entire 2008 mowing season. It does a better job of actually trimming along the fence than any gas or electric trimmer I have used in the last 35 years - period.Second - power is not an issue unless you are trying to clear heavy stuff that hasn't been kept trimmed.Third - battery charge leaves a lot to be desired; it takes a long time to re-charge and extra batteries are expensive. It takes about six batteries worth to do all that we have to do. I've solved this by buying their tiller (see review) and a second trimmer. I now have 5 batteries and three chargers. The second trimmer actually cost very little compared to the price of two batteries.Fourth - I'm 63 with a bad back - the trimmer is well balanced and the weight is no problem.
B0001Q2EMU Purchased as part of the cordless homecare package this trimmer is by far the best unit for our subdivision home. As the homecare package has three batteries and a three bank charger we're never out of power. It will do medium to light trimming and edging without skipping a beat. Light and easy to use, just pick-up and go. The cordless broom cleans up the mess in and flash and your done!Gone are the years of frustration and struggle weilding a gas powered unit, or getting sore yanking the cord trying to start it. Or (ok, I admit it) throwing the gas powered units on the ground in frustration and disgust.
B0001Q2EMU I purchased this trimmer in May 2008 and I am very happy with it.  I have used it about 5 times.  The majority of my weed trimming is done by a yard service, but I needed a trimmer for touch up and weed trimmer in areas outside the lawn.  It is very nice to put in a battery and go.  Battery life is good.  I can get about 20 minutes of hard use (briars, thick weeds) and about 40 minutes of light use (grass) out of a fresh battery.  The unit comes with two batteries.  I have changed the \"string\" once and it was easy.  The trimmer is light and quiet. May experience with the cordless trimmer resulted in me purchasing the B&D cordless pole hedge trimmer.  They use the same battery, which is very helpful.  All and all very good product, if you understand your getting a light duty trimmer.
B0001Q2EMU I love this product!  I have a gas powered trimmer and frankly I got tired of it.  I had to have mixed fuel, I had to prime it, I had to start it, it would not start, I had to clean the carburetor, and it was loud!  With this product I plug in a recharged battery and trim around my one acre yard without hassle.The unit came with two 18 volt batteries and I can trim my whole house 3 times on the same battery.  I then swap the depleted one out with the new one and recharge the old one. I also like how the shaft of the trimmer telescopes because I am tall.  The cutting line automatically advances itself and is always the proper length for maximum cutting speed and power.No mixed gas, much lower noise level, instant start, and no extension cords!  In the time it took to start the old gas unit I am  done using this trimmer.  This thing cuts a 12 inch path and I can trim my 17 trees, driveway and 500 feet of sidewalk in very quick time.  When you use this trimmer you give your lawn that finished look.It comes with a two year warranty and I recommend this product based on my good experience in using it.
B0001Q2EMU I got this item as a Goldbox special with free shipping for a nicely discounted price. I do NOT have large swaths of brush or vegetation to trim through, and if you do, look elsewhere. This is a light-duty trimmer best suited to grass and some herbaceous plant stems.It is fairly lightweight, very easy to use, and the two included batteries are a huge plus for me. I was able to trim up around my yard (~ 1/4 acre)along fence lines and flower beds on one battery. I rushed because many other reviewers have commented that the batteries don't last long enough for them. For my purposes, they are fine and still had enough juice left after I was done. Next time, I'll take it slower to give them a better test.I'm still holding out judgment on the Auto-feed spool; I didn't break the line to a point where I felt there needed to be an advance from the machine. Again, I'll have to give her a few more trial runs to see if she is line-hungry or not. I feel, at this early stage of ownership, that if you can find this trimmer on sale, and have a small to average (whatever that is) sized yard with typical suburban plants growing, you will do well with this device. My only real quibble would be the potential longevity of the NiCad batteries, but some reviewers on here have claimed a life of 3-4 years with them. If I can get that out of this trimmer, I'll consider it money well spent.By the way, in person this trimmer has a distinctly...cheap feel to it. It was a point of concern for me at first, but I grew accustomed to it - I feel the light weight just solidifies the fact that this is NOT a brush cutter - just a device best used to hit some stray grass after mowing on a Sunday afternoon in your backyard. Good luck shopping!
B0001Q2EMU This is a much better trimmer than the other 4 I've owned and I highly recommend it for light trimming.Some will be inclined to call me a nut because this is my fourth B&D; Electric String Trimmer with one exception.  This one is battery operated while the others were operated by 100 feet of extension cord.  Years ago, I bought my first electric trimmer and was pleased with its operation until it burned up in less than a year and the selling company refused to honor its warranty because I did not have the original receipt.  My fault.  I threw it away and have not bought one item from that company since.  I replaced it with my first B&D; electric trimmer and away I went.  I had to increase the length of cord and now I have over 200' of cord to work it.  And it worked fine for a few months and it broke.  B&D; took it back with no problem.  Another one went south and they replaced it.  Each broken trimmer took place within the first year of ownership so my cost was zero except for the handling and packing trash that goes with such a return.  The last corded trimmer still works O.K. but the string device will Not move the string when it is time.  I have to undo the string container and feed it manually.  That doubles my trimming time and is quite a hassle especially during summer.  Incidentally, I have a super gas powered trimmer that I use for the distant sections of the yard and for heavier material.  It is much more powerful and used on special occasions such as when the deer and other critters stop eating the brush.Sorry for the history but I come to this trimmer with a modicum of experience and patience.  This trimmer supports such things as not having to lug that heavy orange cord all around yards of yard.  P.S. I have yet to cut the cord with the trimmer.  I can't believe it either.  The box arrived in one working piece.  A few cuts to tape and actually reading some of the instructions, plugging in the charger and attaching a battery it was a wait until the next day and away we trimmed; with ease.  I ran the battery down in about 30 minutes of trimming and not counting the walking to time.  The next day after the other battery had charged I finished the yard with a little of the juice remaining.  I think \"juice\" is slang for battery power.  The length adjustment is perhaps one of the best features.  One of us is 6'3\" and the other is 5'5\".  One size does not fit all so having the ability to increase or decrease the length is quite nice.  When it is trimming, not cutting, time a simple twist of the shaft permits a straight line of cutting and it sure looks nice when it's fresh.  I felt so good about the trimmer that I even chunked the box in case it did not work.  It works and works well.
B0001Q2EMU this works perfectly. i see no reason to have a gas trimmer. at 18v this has tons of power. comes with two batts so never runs out of power. i get approx one month of use for each charge. ive owned it for one season and would recommend to anyone.
B0001Q2EMU I've had this a couple years and have gotten a ton of use out of it.  My yard is pretty small, just typical socal tract home sized front/back lawns.  On a newer battery I can easily finish the job.  It has good speed, does the job no problem.  Changing string is very easy.  It doesn't feel too heavy at all either.
B0001Q2EMU This trimmer works like a charm. It is plenty good for trimming needs around the home. The automatic string feature is nice. I was always use to having to tap the trimmer on the ground to advance the string.  This you don't have to do anything. You turn the handle which turns the head to edge the sidewalk. I bought this based on comments made on this website. I am am very happy with this purchase.
B0001Q2EMU Bought this for the missus to trim around her flower beds and herb garden and it's perfect for her. Light, easy to use and a single battery charge is enough for her to trim around 8-10 planting areas without having to swap batteries. She's thrilled with it and I can now devote my gas-powered (Ryobi) whacking and trimming to the more onerous areas of our property.
B0001Q2EMU Okay, first for Amazon itself:  What a great place to shop!  I've shopped Amazon for years and have always been extremely satisfied with Amazon's service - quality, value and so far, perfect customer service.UPDATE:I've had and used the trimmer for a few months and have found that after using and recharging the batteries a few times, the batteries seem to last a little longer between charges.  Still works great and I feel safe in saying that this is a good, if not excellent buy (still can't say it is a \"Hog\").Now for the Trimmer.This is a replacement for a gas powered trimmer and so far, it really works well.  I said the trimmer rated a \"qualified\" 5 stars, and here are the caveats:1.  To call this trimmer a \"Grass Hog\" is stretching the truth.  It's more like a grass piglet; but for me, with a small yard, it works great.  However, if you have a really large yard, it may not be what you want.  Having had to wait to receive the trimmer, I had a patch of grass (about 2'x8')that grew to about 6\" or 8\" in height, and really seemed to drag the battery down quickly - fortunately it comes with two batteries.2.  The automatic string feature is nice, but it seems to use way more string than necessary, especially when trimming the curb, sidewalk and driveway (sounded like it was continually feeding string).  Again, for a small yard, it works nicely, but if you have a really large yard, just know it isn't a \"HOG\" and will very likely run out of string quickly.Other than those two caveats, it seems to be, for the price, a great little trimmer, and doesn't pollute the atmosphere.  It doesn't require lots of pulling on a starter rope (along with the associated language necessary to start a stubborn gas trimmer), is fairly well balanced,  light, almost noiseless and really, a joy to use.
B0001Q2EMU I'd give the Grasshog 5 stars if the battery charge lasted a bit longer---it's a good thing it comes with 2---
B0001Q2EMU I'm happy with this trimmer. So much better than the gas one that was hard to start. I have around a 1/4 acre and the trimmer did not run out of juice and handled everything I tried.
B0001Q2EMU Works very good for continuous trimming. Wish had gotten a longer trimmer, as the reach of a 12\" trimmer is only 4\". Actually shorter, due to the curve in the string, which actually reduces the reach to about 3\".But, as long as I know its limitations, we get along OK.
B0001Q2EMU A lot better than messy gas trimmers for small jobs. No mixing gas & oil and no noise. I still have a dual string trimmer for the big jobs in spring but this 18V trimmer is just right the rest of the summer.
B0001Q2EMU The purchase from Amazon was flawless; the trimmer was on by front porch within three days of the order placement. Amazing. Be careful opening the box. I got a nasty paper cut in my eagerness to rip off the box top with brute force. Inside the box everything was expertly packaged and protected with egg carton quality cardboard shell.Luckily operating the machine is simple because the direction sheet leaves much to be desired. It displays as many languages as a United Nations guide, but all in small print, all directions overly succinct. What you need to know is on the direction sheet but not necessarily easy to find because of a lack of clarity and organization.The small pictures provided require the use of a magnifying glass. The pictures aren't annotated with text, just numbered sequentially.So far this handy trimmer has performed flawlessly from one end of Spud Acres to the other. On one charge I trimmed the front beds, the edges of the asphalt driveway, and most of the beds in the backyard. With extra batteries it's a snap to replace a spent battery with a fresh one. With the batteries included with my other Black and Decker cordless yard tools, and the Firestorm 18V battery bought recently, I have 6 batteries for the three tools. Even if a battery is attached to each tool, I still have two fresh batteries on standby on the chargers.This tool easily rates five stars. It's quieter than my other two trimmers, has more than adequate power for my needs, and is easy to maneuver. At first I thought that the pull down edge guide was a useless gimmick, but it actually works very well. Also the automatic line-feed feature is wonderfully convenient.NOTES - Be sure to remove tape from the line cutter and the spool. This bit of advice is not mentioned in the directions.I bought three spools of prewound line when I bought the trimmer, but learned from the directions that one can use bulk line to rearm an empty spool. I like the convenience of using spools ready to use.I like this cordless trimmer so much that my Echo gas trimmer has been gathering dust in the garden shed the past two years.
B0001Q2EMU I love this trimmer for every week sprucing up; it is not powerful enough for heavy duty trimming but does a great job on things I maintain regularly; with two batteries, there is plenty of trimming time for a large yard
B0001Q2EMU I love B&D; tools and have a variety of 18v tools.  I never really owned many gardening tools and decided to buy this and give it a whirl...no pun intended. :-)  The package comes with 2 18v batteries, a spindle of twine, and the hog it self.  Charged one of the batteries for 18 hours or so and off I went to get rid of weeds.  PERFECT....this worked for about 30 minutes on full power and 15-20 minutes on half power with one full  battery.I was impressed...as the 18v electric broom died in 20 minutes...I have now used it about a dozen times and my results are exactly the same....  Replacement twine is avail on Amazon and  your your local big store... :-)5/5 - Great Product, Great Value...especially for us beginners.
B0001Q2EMU Free of restrictive power cords, an electric weedwacker is a very convenient tool.  Black and Decker's NST2018 trimmer is very lightweight, and easy to use.  With a 12 inch diameter cutting path, the unit is suitable for light trimming, touch ups, edging, and catching small areas missed by a mower.  While the motor has enough power for moderate tasks, if you want to trim large areas, or tackle thick, high grass, you probably should look at something more powerful.The trimmer comes with two 18 volt batteries, and you will probably need them both to take on anything except a small job.  It is hard to predict how long a battery may last under actual use, but you might get fifteen minutes of run time from a new battery.  It is a just a good idea to make sure both batteries are charged up, before you start a job.The 0.065 inch trimmer line feeds automatically, you don't bang the spool on the ground, or manually feed line.  The auto feed system works pretty well, but does get stuck at times.  Since the electric motor does not generate higher speeds like a gas motor, the noise level is relatively low.  The unit is very light, and vibration is minimal.  The trimmer guard is constructed of durable hard plastic, and should not crack under normal use.This trimmer is a great for touch ups and smaller yards.  The freedom is wonderful, you are not polluting the air, and your hands won't get dirty mixing fuel.
B0001Q2EMU Everything that has been said is true. This is perfect for those of us who just need to trim the edge of your lawn or clear some overgrown weeds, but it is no bush hog. It comes with two batteries, each of which probably lasts 15 minutes peak on heavier jobs and maybe longer or lightweight edge trimming. We find this sufficient for our 1/3 acre property, though it usually requires both batteries as we tend to wait too long to trim.If you buy this expecting the power of a gas trimmer, you will be disappointed. If you want a trimmer that just works and makes your yard look great, you will be very happy.We had a Toro gas trimmer that was highly recommended by Consumer Reports for years and I could never start it without the help of my husband. This was very frustrating to me because I primarily care for the gardens. Now the gas powered one sits collecting dust because we both use the battery powered Black and Decker.My main gripe is probably that it is so unattractive and that it doesn't go out into the yard and trim without me.
B0001Q2EMU This is a good trimmer for my use. I have a small front yard that i use this for and it works well and the battery lasts long enough and the extra battery is great too.
B0001WV010 Got this a couple weeks ago, and no problems so far. I never tested the temp, but it keeps my seed trays warm!
B0001WV010 The extra bit of warmth helped germinate my seeds including tropical fruit seeds in northern California. It's a pretty small mat if you're super ambitious.
B0001WV010 This was the way to go for me.  I had 4 seedling germination stations and this fit all of them plus I didn't have to pay all too much.
B0001WV010 I have an amazingly good return (sprout rate) on the seeds I planted using this seedling heat mat. What a great idea!This makes growing from seeds so easy.I've learned that it helps to soak the seeds in water for 24 hours or so, or follow the instructions on the packet if they have instructions.Then just sprinkle the dirt over them and provide the right amount of heat. The seeds don't need nutrition at this point, but they do need warm temperatures.I love this product!
B0001WV010 It is sooo totally hot, sleek and shiny, I will pour oil over it and... oh, wait, sorry, that's another review I hope to do someday... this review is for a plastic heating mat to get your seeds asproutin earlier and, hey, there seems to be no other brand out there to buy. This sure does make it an easier purchasing decision.The mat is the right size for one of those seed sprouting kits, but beware that some of them are made of amazingly cheap plastic and leak. It is not a good idea to submerge this pad, although it seems to be sealed up and safe for the typical spills.It seems to work in getting the seeds to sprout, in April on the west coast. My only goal is to have tomato plants going earlier this year.Another reviewer mentioned putting an insulating pad underneath and that would make sense, especially on a concrete or metal surface.But, you ask, how can you give a simple device that actually works only three stars? I bought one of these a few years ago at a box store and it failed in only one season. I also think the price could be better. That is one demerit for every displeasure.Now, about that fun review...
B0001WV010 I have a large bay window with a window seat in my kitchen that gets natural light from three sides. In the spring the seat pads get stashed and out comes and insulated mat that covers the surface, this heat mat, and plant tray with fortified planting material for seedlings or plant cuttings. This mat keeps the plant tray warm and encourages rapid growth without doing much more than keeping the plants warm and fed. In a matter of 3-4 days, the plants sprout and show root growth.I like this mat because I get fast and effective results with this every time I use it. It's a good product that pays for itself with its success rate and the fact that it makes me feel like a gardening pro.
B0001WV010 Just what I was looking for.  I bought two so I can start all of my seeds for spring/summer planting.  While I was using this heat mat, I put styrafoam (bought at Home Depot) under it.  It worked much better.  Germination was much quicker.
B0001WV010 This little device worked like a charm starting my seeds last winter. I couldn't believe how much quicker it took for them to germinate when using this mat. I put it on a timer with my lights and found it easy to use and setup. It kept a nice warm temperature, never getting too hot. Hopefully it will last for quite awhile as I only get to use it a few weeks a year.UPDATE - Year 2 -Seed mat is working as designed again this year. I need to get another one as I have doubled the amount of seeds I am growing. Definitely recommend this product.
B0001WV010 I very much needed this this heat mat for my germination /cloning box setup.This will help speed up the time and increase success in root development in seeds and clones.A must no matter your growings skill and for a small price for a high chance for success.
B0001WV010 Very good seedling mat, I used mine with the digital thermometer. It greatly assisted in my seed germination during the winter months. Recommended for those who start their seeds indoors.
B0001WV010 I bought 2 of these heat mats for my seedlings and they just took off. It does not get overly hot and I used them with the plastic black trays at most garden centers. I could tell the difference between seedlings on the mat and seedlings that did not have a mat in terms of their growth. I would recommend and I plan on buying more.
B0001WV010 I bought one of these to try in my greenhouse. Also bought the hydrofarm MTPRTC digital thermostat here on Amazon. Great pair together. I put this under the starter tray and the seeds sprouted in no time.
B0001WV010 I have a professional quality heat mat from a grow store, this was  a back up. Its smaller, does not quite fit a seedling tray, and is cooler than the pro mat. It is working, seedlings are up, but for more starts I bought another one from the grow store. so this is an ok buy, the pro ones are bigger for the same price.
B0001WV010 These mats (I bought two) operate exactly as advertised.  I raised an astounding number of seedlings this past spring using these mats.  I'm sure my germination rate was greatly influenced by the use of the mats.  Then, after spring, I cleaned them up and am storing them for the next season of use.
B0001WV010 I've got two of these and I really like them since it speeds up the amount of time it takes to get cuttings to root. If they were used on a cooler surface like a concrete or wood surface they'd be perfect as is but running on top of carpet they get a little too warm for my liking. I'm looking into getting some dimmers for them. I saw them on Amazon once so I just need to hunt them down so I can keep these just a little bit cooler.
B0001WV010 First year with a mat for the seeds and jeez - what a difference.  The starts were popping up so fast.  I think the mats really made a difference.  I am very excited for that and plan on using them every year.  I hope they last.
B0001WV010 This is the first year I got these when starting my seeds. I should have gotten these years ago! Instead of only having about 25% to 50% of my seeds sprout I have had 97% of my seeds spout and they are growing faster too. I highly recommend these & they are a reasonable price compared to others too!
B0001WV010 I used to germinate seeds in flats on top of my refrigerator, but after moving to a new place where this didn't work anymore, I needed something else. I tried germinating some seeds last year without anything special, and while I still had good luck, some took a while to come up, and I knew I could do better with some gentle bottom heat. That's why I bought this mat (the 9-by-19.5-in. version, in my case) for this year.My germination rates seem to have improved from last year, but I was expecting that. If one of the cheaper options (e.g., warm place or top of fridge) doesn't work for you or you want more control, you may want to try this. Being new to heat mats, I wasn't sure exactly what I needed, so I bought a thermostat, theHydrofarm MTPRTC, just in case. The mat will only raise the temperature about 10-20 degrees above the room, so with my cool apartment, I probably didn't need this (until I discovered the next trick), but I'm glad I bought it anyway. If you're as unfamiliar with it as I was, here's how it works: the thermostat plugs into the wall, then the heat mat plugs into the thermostat. The thermostat has a probe you insert into the soil, and it will turn the outlet on the thermostat (into which the heat mat is plugged) on or off as needed to maintain the temperature you set on the thermostat. So, it's a lot like a timer, but based on temperature instead of time. If you plug the heat mat directly into the wall, it will just stay on all the time, since the mat itself includes no \"regulator\" like this. This isn't inherently bad, but I'd at least monitor the temperature and compare it to what you want if you do this instead.The \"trick\" I learned, which is also mentioned in the instructions: insulating under the mat helps. My thermostat is now able to keep the mat off for longer than before. I used to have the mat set directly on my counter under the assumption that it wouldn't dissipate that much heat, but I think I was wrong. Even after the simple step of setting the mat on top of a folded towel, the soil has had an easier time staying warmer, and I'm saving electricity by not keeping the mat on as much. You may have better luck if you use a sheet of actual insulation, but even a towel underneath showed improvement for me.As a final note, I measured the electricity usage of this with my Kill A Watt meter. As stated, it uses about 17 Watts when on (which is, in fact, any time it's plugged in to a live outlet, since there is no switch on the mat itself). It's also UL listed. In summary, I'm glad I bought this product. It's working well so far. I haven't had it for that long yet so I can't comment on its longevity, but I'll update this review if it dies unexpectedly.
B0001WV010 I have used this to help germinate some cucumbers I started indoors in a small greenhouse tent. At night when the grow lights are unplugged the inside get fairly chilly like the rest of the house, but with this heat mat I can leave it on all night and not have to worry about the seedlings. I would say it keeps the inside temperatures a good 10 degrees warmer than without it. I found the cord to be a little short but it's really no big deal. Before purchasing I compared this with the ones for sale on Gardener's Supply and this seemed to be much better value for the size.
B0001WV010 I've had problems before trying to clone my plants or even with seed.  This used with a tray and dome is all it took for a 100% success rate on all my clones and seeds
B0001WV010 If you live anywhere where keeping the proper temperature for germinating seeds this is a must, even as your plants grow you'll see how much better they do with the heat mat
B0001WV010 I tried this because the idea made sense, and now I'm a believer.  I planted cucumbers, swiss chard, romaine lettuce, squash, watermelon, various tomatoes, etc... The first cucumber sprouted in 3 days!.  And the other seedlings are doing well.  I'm sure that my potting mix helped as well, but looks like this mat lives up to its promise.  I will probably pick up a second mat next year.
B0001WYNP0 You can get some pretty good tomatoes if you use good potting soil, water the plants in time and make sure that they don't get burned by too much sun while young.Yield:Each planter can grow exactly ONE tomato plant so make sure that you choose wisely. At the peak, for a couple of months we could harvest 1, sometimes 2 large, usually perfect tomatoes on any given days.It IS possible to have some herbs growing on top of the planter.Care:Like I said, water frequently because all water follows gravity so not a lot of it is retained.Take special care not to choke the plant. There is some 'sponge plug' at the bottom of the planter through which the tomato grows. Make sure that it does NOT squeeze the stem or you may see a vigorous plant growing only to die later because the bottom opening wasn't wide enought.Durability:Six out of the 8 planters we used last year can be reused this year. The other 2 developed some cracks and we will not use them again.GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR TOMATOES!
B0001WYNP0 My tomato garden is on my patio so space is at a premium.  To expand my gardening space last year I added a Topsy Turvy planter.  I grew cherry tomatos in it, because they tend to stay more compact and produce a lot of small sweet tomatos.The main down fall of tomatos growing in the topsy turvy planter can be the lack of water because the dirt dries out much quicker than the dirt around tomatoes planted in the ground.  To solve this problem I used a drip irrigation system on a timer which released a small amount of water into the plant several times a day.  This kept my tomatos very happy and healthy.  A drip irrigation system may sound expensive but you can buy a kit for around $20 dollarsRain Bird Patio Watering Kit PATIO-KIT.  Since everything in containers gets dry fast, I have my entire patio garden watered by a drip irrigation system.  After buying a small drip irrigation set up 3 years ago, it has been functioning great each summer and all my vegetables, strawberries, and herbs have been much more productive.
B0001WYNP0 Plastic bag with a few metal rings.  Within a few weeks the metal had pushed through the plastic edges so water would just run out the sides.  The metal also started to rust and the whole thing looks as classy as a bag of trash hanging on a hook.  If this was free, you would still not want it.  Get a pot and a tomato cage. ;)
B0001WYNP0 I HAVE BOUGHT SEVEN OF THESE AND HAVE PLANTED TOMATO PLANTES IN MARCH AND NOW THEY HAVE BEGUN TO GROW LARGER AND HAVING BLOOMS---LOOKS LIKE FUN
B0001WYNP0 This is our third year growing tomatoes upside down, so to speak.  At first I was dubious, but now we look forward to growing our own tomatoes.  We have one for large roma tomatoes and another for small cherry tomatoes.  We have to grow these up and away from wild turkeys that roam in our neighborhood looking to eat any and all fresh vegetable shoots.  We placed them on an upper deck with a drip system.  For optimal growth we have them hanging up against the house so more heat bounces off the house onto the plants; heat is ideal for growing tomatoes.  We regularly trim and pinch off new growth so that all the energy goes into the tomatoes.Four star:  These are plastic and are only useable for one year.  I have had a couple of the plastic breakdown before the fruit bearing season was over and had to duct tape it back together.  We will keep using these for our particular situation.  We love our fresh tomatoes.
B0001WYNP0 I ordered three of the Topsy Turvy Upside-down Tomato Planters last spring for the summer of 2006, thinking it would be great for saving space in my small garden area.  I ordered it and had my husband install hooks on our south-facing back patio.  When they arrived, I inserted the plants just as described and filled them with the best possible bagged soil I could find.  Not only did they not grow any better than the traditional ground method, but it was too heavy for me to lift up to the hooks.  My husband (operates heavy equipment for a living and very strong) even had difficulty doing the lifting once they were filled with soil, both when they were installed and then again when they were taken down in October, with our first frost. If you are not strong enough to lift 50-100 lbs, don't purchase. Considering the trouble I had with this product, I would not purchase this item again, and would recommend that if you have any disabilities as I have or are elderly, try the traditional method. I'm thinking about having my husband build me some small raised beds about 2 feet off the ground!
B0001WYNP0 Last year our tomatoes did really well on the south side of our home, but we needed to make room for other things so I decided to give this a try.Out of the box it's pretty self explanatory as to what you need to do. Open, insert tomato start, fill with potting soil, hang and water. So far my tomatoes are looking great! They haven't ripened yet, but there are plenty of them on the verge. One important thing is to water often! It's easy to forget and if you don't water enough you won't have good results.Overall this is a good product that I think is worth the price, especially if you are limited on your space.  The only suggestions I would make are to make sure that you get your tomato start in early.  I got busy and put mine in after it had grown quite a bit, not easy at all and more stress on the plant than it needed. Also make sure your hanger is sturdy, with the soil, water and mature plant it becomes quite heavy.**UPDATE**After seeing a recent thread in the Amazon Gold Box Forum I remembered that I hadn't come back to post any pictures. Several forum posters complained that the Topsy Turvy was a waste of money and didn't work. I have already had one successful year and expect another one. I just uploaded one, it's within a week of putting the start. I will continue to add pictures as the plant progresses.
B0001WYNP0 This may look like a gimmick to you but it's not.  This planter can actually grow tomatoes and other vegetables.  All you need is a sunny place to hang it.  If you live in an apartment or otherwise have no garden space, try this.  They call it a tomato planter but it actually should be called a vegetable planter.  Last summer I grew tomatoes, bell peppers and cucumbers in them.  I believe it needs to contain more soil (larger) to be an ideal tomato planter.  It grew lots of tomatoes but peppers and cucumbers did even better.  One trick to know (not applicable for tomatoes)- take the top plastic cover off and plant 2 vegetable plants per topsy turvy-- one in the top and one in the bottom.
B0001WYNP0 Now im a green thumbaholic when it comes to trying anything new in the gardening world. I love the feeling i get when i literally cant wait to open the box and try it out and see the results... Nothing was different when it comes to this topsy turvy. I bought two for my mom and one for myself to test different varieties of tomatoes. Well to make it short, the harvest was embarrassing. I had a crimson cushion in both mine and my mothers plus one in a 1 gallon and one in a 3 gallon pot for the ultimate test of durability, watering, nutes, 
B0001WYNP0 Especially with cherry and grape sized tomatoes. Amazing production, it's out of the way, well-engineered, they even include a nice big metal hook to hang it with! The plastic-fabric sides WILL disintegrate in a couple-three years, so don't expect this to be a lifetime purchase. But it works great, you'll have more tomatoes than you'll know what to do with! I ordered two of these to replace the single one I had bought a couple years ago. Very clever idea, highly recommended! HINT: don't use cheap potting soil!
B0001WYNP0 my tomato plant have given me a dozen tomatoes. although not large they have been very tasty. i would recommend this item it works very well
B0001WYNP0 I have tried these upside-down tomato planter two years in a row with not great success. I would get some tomatoes but the plants would eventually die. Since these are upside down gravity causes the plant to not keep much water so these need to be watered a lot especially in the hot summer. I setup an automatic watering kit but it did not seam to help. I will not buy these again.
B0001WYNP0 I am a Master Gardener, which in my state means I need to have continuing education each year and teach minimum amount of hours.  We can't teach old wive's tales, just scientifically proven plant info (but some of the old wive's tales have been proven, so they are O.K. :-) ). These upside-down planters have been a big discussion point and unbiased studies have been done on their effectiveness.  They have been proven to produce less than conventionally grown plants.  I am giving two stars for the novelty factor, but I would never recommend them for anyone who actually wants tomatoes.More work + more expensive + less fruit = thumbs down
B0001WYNP0 This does exactly as advertised. The Black Russian Truffle Tomato i put in mine was growing famously. Actually, it's growth was fairly unprecedented, until....the whole thing fell and the plant's main stem was crushed. See, when the planter is watered properly, it is also incredibly heavy for its size. So, the lesson there would be to make sure whatever you hang it from can hold quite a bit of weight. I would say it needs to be able to hold at least twenty pounds, since the total weight of a fully grown plant with the planter and all the requisite soil and watering will at least end up weighing this much. It might be safer to shoot for 30 pounds though. However, that was a user error problem on my part for not planning properly. The planter itself is great. You cant overwater, as any excess will simply run out the bottom. A good solid and inexpensive purchase.
B0001WYNP0 Bought two after watching neighbor's do fairly well except for watering neglect.This year will have her hang closer to our yard so we can keep eye on it.These two, when set, will be accessible to daily watering as needed.  It doesn't look to be any 'foam ring' in these 2.  BUT one can always stir 'foam packing peanuts' into dirt/potting mixture, which will create some lightness to over all hanging weight, as well as help with water retention.As to Fabric rotting/giving out after one season vs the earlier reviews. Sounds like the typical of past 4 yrs of IMPORTED product where the MFG has reduced the quality of the fabric.
B0001WYNP0 This thing really makes no sense at all.  I was given one of these as a gift, so I used it.  But I also grow tomatoes in a garden every year, so I will use that for my pro/con comparison after using the Topsy Turvy this past summer.Cons:1. Costs more than a whole bunch of seedling tomato plants.2. Needs potting soil which adds to the cost.3. Must water EVERY day or the tomato plant drys out very quickly.4. Doesn't produce nearly as many or as large of tomatoes as a plant in the ground (or in a big pot).5. Not reusable as the \"bag\" became brittle and falls apart after a summer in the sun.Pros:1. Takes up very little space as long as you have a place to hang it (note: it must be a sunny place).2. Seems built well enough not to break easily (at least for one summer's use).3. You don't have to \"stake\" the plant so the vines don't break.  Hanging upside-down, the vines are fine.4. Plants growing upside-down are interesting to look at.But really, this thing makes no sense.  Why plant something upside-down?  You could plant your tomato plant right-side-up in this thing and you would probably be better off, and you would not be bothered with the extra effort involved in planting it upside-down. In fact, you could buy any decent-sized hanging basket and plant a tomato plant in it and let the vines tumble over the side of the pot and have nearly the same thing.  Or just buy a big pot if you have a place on the ground to put it (but staking the vines would be better then).  But, it doesn't have to be upside down.  The upside-down concept is just a gimmick to get you to buy this thing instead of a regular hanging basket.Since I have this thing and a place to hang it, I would have probably used it again, excepting for the fact that the plastic \"bag\" becomes brittle and falls apart when you touch it after a season in the sun.  So you won't be able to use this year after year as there is no way it would stay together when handled enough to replant another tomato plant in it.  They should have used a plastic that isn't destroyed by the sun.  So don't buy this thing with the thought that you can use it season after season.Anyway, the kids look at it strange, so at least it is interesting.  But that bit of unusual-ness is its only real value.  If you just want tomatoes and don't care about the upside-down gimmick, there is really no reason to buy this.  Just buy any pot or hanging basket and plant your tomato right-side-up.But it does work, and once you plant your tomato you don't have to stake it up, and it is interesting to some to see a plant growing upside-down, so I give it a rating of two stars even though I find it really is pretty goofy to begin with.  And you are not going to get as many or as large of tomatoes as a plant in the ground.  But thinking about it, if I used my own money to buy it (instead of receiving it as a gift), I would only give it one star.  Really, it is a silly thing useful only as a gimmick to grow a tomato plant upside down.  If this is your only choice, buying tomatoes at a farmer's market would probably make more sense.
B0001WYNP0 This product works as advertised, my tomatoes are doing very well.  However, it is VERY heavy when filled with dirt and watered.  You need a sturdy hook and place to hang it.  I was having problems with it drying out quickly (granted, I live in New Mexico, where it is quite dry) even though I had added water absorbing crystals to the soil.  I ended up removing the top 6 inches of soil and placing a plastic milk jug in the top.  I punched some holes in the bottom of the jug and I fill this with water nearly every day.  The water then slowly seeps in to the soil instead of running out the bottom, dripping is reduced and the plant gets the water it needs.  I would give it five stars if some system were in place to keep it from dripping so I could use it indoors and if it were a little easier to plant.
B0001XLSGQ This is the second 4 foot hydrofarm grow light ive purchased.  I bought one last year and then again one this year. (The first one still works great)  I use the grow light for my seed starter kits and noticed that the seedlings directly under the light grow alot stronger and healthier than the ones on the outside edges.  So thats where the 2nd light purchase came in.Having the lights hang from the adjustable strings is a pretty nice feature.  As the plants grow you can raise the light up by the pull of a string.The only thing i would change about this light that would make it better would be if it had 2 bulbs so it covers more area.
B0001XLSGQ I've been using this to keep plants alive during the frost, I didn't think they could grow anymore because of the cold. This thing makes them grow! I was surprised. The plants went from about 12 inches tall to about 18 inches. I keep the light on for about 16 hours a day, and if it's warm enough outside I put them out there on a roller.My only con is that the frame could be built better, other than that it's great if you have a few plants you need to keep alive during the winter. It's good even if you want to start plants.
B0001XLSGQ I have a small greenhouse and I'm using this Grow Light to keep my vegetables going. It provides light in Winter to 5 Earthboxes full of vegetables. Does it work? I have 5 planters full of vegetables, some blooming getting ready to fruit, and some squash and cucumbers with fruit on them, and there is ice and snow on the ground outside, very little natural light this time of year.It seems flimsy, and you wouldn't want to kick it around or place it somewhere with lots of traffic and people bumping into it. Otherwise, I haven't a problem with the fact that it isn't SOLID. I move it around a little every day or two to make sure everything is getting some light. It handles that just fine.I'm thinking of getting another one or two. If it wasn't so expensive, I would. I haven't found anything I like better.
B0001XLSGQ I live in the mountains of California and we have a very short \"summer\" season. I wanted to grow tomatoes, spinach and herbs indoors. This system is perfect! First of all it was very easy to set up. There were no tools necessary except for a rubber hammer for just one connection that was a little tight. There is only one bulb which was a concern at first, but this 54 Watt/T5 bulb throws out an incredible amount of light. Much more than my old two-bulb/T12 (fatter bulbs) fixture. I did the math: This system costs a mere $5 a month to keep on for 12 hours a day. That's in California which has one of the highest electricity costs at 15 cents a KW.I have this set up on a 6 foot by 2 1/2 foot table and the light shines across the whole table! Printed on the crossbar is a note that this stand can hold up to 30 pounds. That means that I can attach a larger light fixture with two bulbs, or even my 4 bulb (thin T5's) fixture and use it with a much larger table (or two) without any trouble. Nice to have options.Under the light I have a large \"grow box\" 29\" wide and 15\" deep. PLUS smaller 24\" x 8\" boxes for the herbs, spinach and bush beans. I have covered the whole table with planters and they all get plenty of light. The light goes easily on and off with a toggle, or you can use a timer. Being able to adjust the light up and down with ease is a great plus. I have some planters sitting on boxes to get the right height for them, as I will be adjusting the light for the benefit of the tomatoes.I found the perfect indoor tomato. It's called \"extreme dwarf bush tomato\". Seeds are available on line from many specialty seed companies. This tomato bush grows only about 18-24 inches tall and since this system is 32 1/2\" tall, it's perfect. This brings me to the best feature of this unit: it's tall! You can grow so many things under this light that you may not have thought of. Some indoor greenhouses only have only 12 inches between shelves to work with. Additionally, you could place this unit's legs on bricks or boxes and raise it even further if you needed to.The high output T5 bulb is rated 6400K-Full Daylight Spectrum, and will last 20,000 hours. That's 1,667 12-hour days, or over 4 1/2 years, and costs pennies a day to run. The fixture gets slightly warm, but not hot at all. This unit is sturdy, not flimsy at all, and will last a very long time. I'm buying another one and getting ready for bare root strawberry planting time!
B0001XLSGQ As you can see, most of these reviews are very old.  I have one and it is very sturdy and designed quite well. The lifting mechanism works great and is a great improvement over most of the more inexpensive systems that require moving each side separately.  I would definitely recommend this system - its a nice dark forest green and the paint job is excellent - you could put it in the living room and it would look just fine.  I can't comment on shipping and packing as I bought mine at a retail store but I would have to say the package itself seems pretty well packed so if anything breaks I would say the retailer you bought it from did not protect it well enough in the shipping box.  It is, afterall, a lightbulb and should be shipped as such, with plenty of pellets.
B0001XLSGQ When I retired, I wanted to retire my home made pvc light stand.  Mind you, there was nothing wrong with it.  Having said that, these light systems by Hydrofarm are fantastic.  I have four of them and used them all winter.  Packaging and instructions were right on and they are absolutely wonderful. I wondered at the system for raising the light up and down because it seemed so simple.  Well, simple and smooth it is.  It raises and lowers the lights in micro inches if you want. In this way you can raise them as the plants grow and it seems not to wear out at all with one season behind them.  I wish I had done this way before I retired.
B0001XLSGQ I just set this up over the trays with my spring seed crops started.  It was super easy to assemble.  The parts just pop together and it goes up like a breeze.  The instructions refer to chains for hanging the light but the hanging mechanism is not a chain but that is OK.  Overall this solves trying to rig a light up over the trays and will come apart to store.  Great product!
B0001XLSGQ This was very easy to assemble, very sturdy. Everything was intact in the box. I used this all winter and I am going to have a bumper crop of veggies. Very pleased with this product. Easy to pack up and store away for the summer too. Highly recommend
B0001XLSGQ The advantages of grow lights are obvious, so I won't summarize them here.  I will mention that the sign on the produce advising that it is for use only in dry environments was surprising.  Surely a product intended to be used in raising plants is by definition going to be used in a somewhat humid environment.  That aside, it's a good little unit, easy to assemble and fairly easy to disassemble later.  I'm not sorry to own one.
B0001XLSGQ This this is the best. It was easy to install and setup and the guillotine nature of the suspended lights make it easy to adjust the light source as your plants grow. I had this system combined with the greenhouse kits and heat mats with thermostats and my starters came up extraordinarily quicker than any other method I have tried previously. I did notice it took a bit longer for it to ship, but it is an absolute charm. No more trying to grow plants in my kitchen window sill!
B0001XLSGQ Unlike some other reviewers, I find the build quality satisfactory. It is a little small for potted plants, however. When raised to the highest position, the lamp has a 26\" clearance to the ground. The high-efficiency bulb generates a little less heat than standard fluorescent lights but is still hot enough to scorch leaves that come too close. In short, the maximum height for the plants is around 24\", sufficient for a seed starter but way too low to serve as a mini-green house for plants that need to winter indoors.
B0001XLSGQ This is a great system for lighting, and I have absolutely no complaints with that.  I wish this unit had come with optional items one could buy along with it such as 'heating pad the length of the light.'  I tried to find one but they were all too short.  With the right heating pad I would have had far better results - but again, no problem of the light.  Strongly recommend it.
B0001XLSGQ I am very impressed with this unit!  I was able to start most of my seeds indoors this year and the ability to raise and lower the light easily to make sure you don't end up with spindly plants is great.  The light does not put out massive amounts of heat at all and is *incredibly* bright!  What amazing technology.  Highly recommend if you are a gardener who lives in an area with a short growing season.  The unit is extremely portable and lightweight.  It is also so simple to put together almost anyone could do it.  I prefer putting it on a table for easier access to plants and I also bought an inexpensive timer so I wouldn't have to remember to turn the unit on and off while working.  Great value.
B0001XLSGQ Went together easily enough. The hanging string design is a bit wonky and is hard to really get level. I've found these size bulbs are difficult to find locally.It serves its purpose, but I think there are better options for the money.. though they do require a bit more DIY spirit.
B0001XLSGQ I like to grow herbs indoors, and save a ton of money by starting flowers and veggies inside, 3 months before I can move 'em outdoors.I've had the Hydrofarm Jump Start for a couple of weeks, and already have some pretty little green heads pushing up from the Jiffy peat pellets.Some have said that the metal bars were flimsy, but that's not what I found. They're more than adequate for the job, and fit together easily enough.It's a bit confusing when the company talks about \"bulbs\" - plural - since there is only 1 fluorescent tube supplied, or that could fit in the highly reflective holder.This is an energy-efficient T5 fluorescent tube - one of the new, skinny kind. I'm used to seeing the standard store type - the T12's - which are big around as a silver dollar (and are being phased out). This one would have a diameter more like a quarter. You can replace them easily enough at your local hardware/home supply store - I checked.This is just the 4-foot lighting system: I also ordered a company's Germination Station, Heat Mat and Digital Thermostat (sold separately).I'd say this was a well thought out device, relatively simple, sturdy enough, and works well.Recommended!
B00022OK2A This is very heavily built and well designed.  For a compact grill it reaches cooking temperature rapidly, and can hold 6 large burgers easily.  You can adjust the grill height to two positions. So far I've found the high position cooks best for my own style of cooking.  It's is easy to clean (set it on the grass and hose it out).  The bottom grating is showing signs of rust, so I've started using WD-40 on it after I rinse it out.  However, it is so stout that I don't know that the slight rust would cause a problem for some time.
B00022OK2A Pros:1) Beautiful sear marks and flavour2) Preseasoned, so it's easy care, just wipe down with an oily paper towel, and remember to cleanup the ash after use.3) Simple effective no-frills design.4) Can be used as an outdoor firepit.5) Sturdily built.6) The oval shape is much more space-efficient than the round one:a) for finding somewhere to put it,b) the cooking surface - you can fit 6 burger patties on this, flank steak, a full rack of ribs, good sized slab of salmon...(not all at once!) plus two or three medium potatoes wrapped in foil next to the coals.  You can cook for 2-6 pple.c) in arranging the coals for the right type of heat for what you want to cook.Cons:1) No lid -- For a lid, I would suggest the Cajun Classic brand cast-iron oval dutchoven flipped upside down.2) Matching oval-shaped Lodge cast-iron Dutch oven is discontinued (could be used as lid, griddle and dutch oven).3) It is heavy4) It is ugly5) Design too basic? Could be made more user friendly with height-adjust option during cooking.  Currently, you have to flip the grill over to change height.You have to really know your coals. Not very charcoal-phob friendly.6) Limited use:a) Cast Iron retains heat and cools slowly, so not very pratical for anything where you might have to move it before it cools.b) Needs to be baby-ed: water + ash = lye, which will eat away at the cast iron bottom causing rust. So no open grilling in a snowstorm, during unstable weather, or leaving out overnight to cool.  You have to go back out when it cools to put it under some sort of cover.Needful accessories:1) Oval dutch oven to be flipped upside down and used as a lid.2) Chimney starter.3) dutch oven lifter which can we used to lift the grill grate and adjust the height while grate is still hot.4) alternately a pair of heat resistant gloves.5) 2 pairs of heat resistant tongs, one for fiddling with the coals/ash and another for cooking with.6) The nylon cover to help protect it from weather (better than nothing, but a garage or shed is best).Conclusion:Love it for its efficient size and shape, great sear marks and flavour.  Hate it for when the sky threatens to snow/rain.Precaution for those who live on the shore:I live by the shore and have salt water mist roll in overnight.  I MUST move it into the shed, as moisture/mist/condensation will collect even under the protective covering.  Also, a well oiled and cleaned grate will rust in the salt mist if left out overnight.
B00022OK2A I'm no metal expert but there is a big difference between real cast iron and the pot metal a lot of these cheapie grills are made of.  The Sportsman's is the real thing, plus has the solid look and feel of quality.  Not to mention a near perfect design, the large oval grill top gives plenty of surface area for even a backyard BBQ.  It takes only a small amount of coal to fill the bottom, and temperature is controlled by the sliding air intake near the bottom.  You can had more coal though the front door if it gets too low.I grilled 10 brats on it last summer and they came out perfect, of course I cheated a little because I precooked them in beer and punched them once with a fork.  That allows your grill to brown them without constant attention, and so they don't explode if it's too hot, plus they cook up in 8 minutes not 20 on a moderate heated grill.  I then switched to foil wrapped ears of corn, and finished the grill day off with a dozen shish kabobs with chicken, pineapple, sweet pepper, onions, and small heirloom tomatoes.  Everything came out great, and having participated in my friends sacrificial offerings disguised as a BBQ, I know the difference between cooked and hopelessly burned.Not to mention if you have a big gas or charcoal grill this is a quick way to do a smaller scale BBQ for just yourself and immediate family without breaking out then having to clean the big grill.  Best way to clean this, let it burn all the way down, take off the top grill, the door and the other small parts, dump the ashes (cold) into the trash, wipe with a damp cloth and your back in business total cleaning time 3-5 minutes.  Was it ever easier to clean a backyard grill.  FYI it's iron don't leave it outside in the rain or keep it wet it will rust!  Recommended, for all, but small children, or irresponsible pyromaniacs!
B00022OK2A This thing is awesome! Just big enough to cook for a small get together, but small enough to fire up for just two.  I currently have 8 different Weber Grill/Smokers - but I find I use this grill more than any of them.  A handful of lump charcoal and this baby is good for at least 4 hours.  Still learning different ways to cook with it, but this is much better than starting the range up in the hot summer.  TheLodge Logic 5-Quart Pre-Seasoned Dutch Ovenfits perfectly on top, and you could probably get two of them to fit without issue.It's also nice to place in the center of the table and everyone can cook their foods on it, then after cook marshmallows.  Food, Friends & Drink!  Life is good......
B00022OK2A For starters, there are no instructions. Look at the pictures. There only two screws and they hold the body to the base...kind of. There's a door on the front, seems intuitive, but when you pick the grill up by the bail the grill tilts forward and the door flops open. Maybe I'm slow, but it took a good ten minutes to figure out what went where. Also this is a pre-seasoned grill and there are no directions as to use and preserve the coating.Edit: I just used it and could not dump the ashes. Even a cheap hibachi has wooden handles to grab. With this you have to heft it by the bail and tip it which isn't easy to do one-handed given the weight of this thing. I really want to love it, but, so far, we're not doing well.
B00022OK2A After all, it IS cast iron.  It should last a lifetime.  It was very easy to put together, and we expect to use it for making kabobs on these warm summer days.  I think it took all of about 4 minutes to put it together.  There were no instructions and none were needed.We already have a charcoal grill, but sometimes you want just to cook enough for say two people and that's it, with no left overs.  This will do the job very nicely and not use a lot of charcoal.Oh, they recommend you place it on a concrete patio block to protect any surfaces underneath the grill.  The legs will get pretty hot, and the concrete block will absorb most of that, and not allow for any charring to take place under the unit.  You will need to have protective gloves on to handle the draft vents.
B00022OK2A Great cast-iron grill.  We have usually cooked on a typical Weber-type charcoal grill, and we still use that a lot.  But this little grill has become our favorite for a quick, fun family grill time.  We use a charcoal chimney to get the coals going (half of what we use in the Weber) and sometimes add food-grade wood chips to cook chicken, salmon, burgers, hot dogs, and steak. After grilling, I will remove the grate, add some wood, and we'll roast marshmallow over a small fire.  Clean up is typical for cast iron (no soap, just hot water and light scrubbing).  Just be sure to keep the entire grill (not just the grate) well-seaosned. To clean the outside, I use hot water, a soap-free scrub sponge, and then season the body of the grill while it is still warm (so that the water evaporates and the seasoning can sink in). If you like cooking with cast iron, this is a GREAT grill to get.  If you do not like cast iron, then this grill likely won't work for you.
B00022OK2A We've had a dozen of those cheap portable charcoal grills that either don't cook worth a darn or fall apart after a single season.  This one definitely won't be doing that. Very sturdy, good quality grill - quality we expect from Lodge. I have a feeling this is the last portable grill we'll ever have to buy, and it's a good thing because these are getting harder and harder to find.We BBQ throughout the year and this is perfect for the deck and porch. Mind you, if you're looking to feed the family and guests in your backyard, you need a bigger grill, but if you're camping or just grilling up a chicken, steak, or a couple burgers - this is absolutely perfect!  While the price of cast iron has sharply increased recently, if you take care of (see below) this grill, it will actually save you money over the years.NOTE:  This is made out of cast iron. If you don't know how to care for cast iron, you need to search the web for (easy) instructions on how to &#34;season&#34; cast iron. It takes time and anybody CAN do it, but if you're lazy and won't WANT to put the (little) effort into it, please DON'T buy this - you won't be happy.  DO NOT throw it away if it shows signs of rusts  - give it to lover of cast iron and they'll put the effort into it to fix it up - and they'll love you for the gift!
B00022OK2A The Lodge Logic L410 Sportsman grill is wonderful. I received this as a Father's Day gift and put it to work. 28 briquettes and cooked 4 1/3Lb burgers and 4 jumbo hotdogs to perfection. 1\" thick steaks cooked perfectly. Easy to assemble and clean.  Took a lightly oiled cloth to clean out any residual ash once it cooled. Stores nicely. I will mention it is heavy so be careful. It is cast iron and therefor weights a bit. Others have concerns about the tabs breaking off the door, but if you are moving it that much remove the door to move the grill.
B00022OK2A One of my friends received this as a gift to use for tailgating parties.  After a few uses, he decided it took to long to cool off, was to hard to clean and had put it back in the box with the intention of setting it out with the trash!  Fortunately before he did, he saw me looking at it on this website and asked if I planned on buying it.  I said yes and he said don't because he had one that he was going to throw away.  If I didn't mind it being used and a little rusty, I could have his.  I took it.  It was rusted but I scrubbed it, oiled all the parts, and seasoned it in the oven (it was still cold outside so I couldn't fire it up)!This little grill came in so handy when we bought another house in the spring and removed the stove to make way for the new one. I cooked on it everyday.  What my friend found as a disadvantage, I found as an advantage, it stays hot for a long time!I grilled everything, half smokes, kabobs, burgers, chicken, veggies, fish, etc. . . and nothing stuck!  I also grilled ribs on it.  I sliced them into individual ribs, placed them on the grill, and covered them with foil (crimped the foil around the rack with tongs). They turned out really good. I used my little cast iron skillet on top of the rack to scramble eggs, and blacken steaks (lots of coals needed for that).The grill is very durable and as long as it is properly taken care of will provide many years of grilling pleasure!  I really like it because the grill rack can be put in the sink for easy clean up and as long as it's properly seasoned, I don't have to worry about my food sticking to it.I also have a 22\" weber kettle grill that I use when I want to grill a lot of food or large items.  If I don't, I set this one inside of it on the grate and use it instead.  This is an excellent grill for a small household, and I recommend it over the other hibachi type grills.  It's great for camping but keep in mind that since it's cast iron it takes a long time to cool down, so start grillin' early!
B00023RSUA I purchased this set in 2006, but it came with a 3 batt charger and 3 batts.  Since then it has undergone continuous use from the spring to fall.  I have also added 3 more batts to get the jobs done in my yard (total 6 batts).  It is a convenient set to use.Hedger: Good at lasting a long time (just used it for some large bushes a few weeks ago).  No cord to keep track of makes this much easier to hedge with abandon.  Decent power, as I can go through normal size hedge branches and leaves without too much problem.  Also, no cord makes it easier to climb around my walls and just stretch my hand out to get to tall/far places.Blower: Goes through a batt fairly quickly.  Pretty powerful since it only runs on batts.  Easily clears off my sidewalk and driveway or loose leaves/grass/dirt.  I probably use this tool the most.Trimmer: Is decent, but not terribly powerful.  The replacement spools run about $14-16/3pk which adds up over time.  However, I almost never use the trimmer now that I've upgraded to the B/D 24v versionBlack & Decker NST1024 24-Volt Cordless String Trimmer/Edger, which is much more powerful and lasts longer on one batt.  Trimmer is good for just grass and small weed growth.  Don't go tackling big grasses and weed bushes unless you are a patient person.After awhile the 18v batts lose their ability to hold juice, and so after a couple of years, you will to either replace the batts or deal with less and less capacity.  Batts run ~$30-40.  I think this set is ideal for those who live in townhouses, or have small yards, like 1/4 acre.  It is VERY convenient to not have a cord trailing you.  No cord to roll up when you're done.  No gas or oil changes to bother with either.  After almost 5 years, everything still works fine (though the batts are getting lame).
B00023RSUA Got sick and tired of maintenance of my gas and corded lawn equipment, so I got rid of it and went electric (and cordless!)Price ($165) here is incredible based on what other places sell this kit for, so for the price I paid, 5 star easily.Pros:- so easy to start and use- 3 included batts (and a charger than can charge all 3 at once!) ensures you have plenty of juice for small to medium yards-lightweight tools, easy to maneuver-costCons:- cheap plasticky feel (I guess to keep them lightweight, everything's a tradeoff)- this is NOT for anything other than LIGHT yard work.  If you live in an overgrown jungle, do not get this kit.- I wish the string trimmer had dual strings coming out, not one, and the reach was a little longerI have just started using these, so no thoughts on reliability, but I have used all three tools.  Was most impressed by the hedge trimmer I think.  They took on a huge 6 ft. out of control loropetalum I have w/o any problem at all.  Wow...impressed with the power there.String trimmer is kind of weak, but I expected that...I mean it IS running on a BATTERY for pete's sake!  I did wish it had SLIGHTLY more reach as well, as I had to get really close to some of the walls that my grass grows next to.Blower is best thought of as a carport/deck/garage blower and nothing more than that.  It did great in my small carport and deck, but I would never try to use it for actual leaves (I would never blow my leaves anyway, rakes are faster imo).Anyway, a reserved 5 star...if we had half stars, I would give it a 4.5 for a great little kit at a fantastic price.Completely dependent on what kind and size of yard you have though.
B00023RSUA After passing this up last year when it was a deal of the day, I was lucky enough to stumble across it again this year and told myself, don't make the same mistake twice.  I didn't, and I have no real reservations about the purchase at this point.The main reason I purchased these items were convenience.  I was tired of hauling the electrical cord to the back yard so I could finish out the mowing.  I've never owned a blower or power hedge trimmer, so those were a bonus.Perhaps the best part of this package is that the edger has auto feed, meaning I don't have to tap it on the ground to advance the spool.  I absolutely love that.The blower works fine for what I use it on.  We have a patio, driveway and a small section of sidewalk that we blow off maybe every weekend.  While not exceedingly powerful at 120mph, it does do what I want it to do.  However, for some of the really dirty areas on the patio, water is still needed; which is what I was trying to avoid.The hedge trimmers are great and I can get through our 6 or so bushes without a problem.All in all, I think this is a great package of electric tools.  They have enough juice to do the job I need them to, but I can also see where they may not be very good for larger projects, especially with the only 2 included batteries.
B00023RSUA I bought this set in 2011 when moving to a new (to us) home with much more lawn, shrubs, and trees than I've ever had. I also have the 18V lopper so in all 4 batteries that fit any of these tools.First of all the light weight of these tools really helps. Batteries last long enough for me to do what I need to do and I always have spares if I need them. Second there are no cords to deal with, no gas needs, no oil needs, no pull starting, and the batteries are quick and easy to install and remove.The real champ of these three tools is the edger. I've used it now for about 15 months and have not had to replace the line yet! I bought a spare pack of three line spools and it is still unopened. Second the line auto-feeds; no tapping! It has lots of power to edge our two lawns, and trim around trees after I've mowed. It is quick and easy to rotate the head for edging or trimming. Sweet little tool.The hedge trimmer works great. We have lots of bushes and hedges that require a trim about twice a month. The best thing about this trimmer is how light it is.The weak link in the chain is the blower. It is just a little weak in terms of the stream of air it blasts. It starts out with a little more power but within a minute or so it slows down about 10% then stays there for 5-10 minutes until it really starts to lose power as the battery drains. I still use it, haven't felt the need to go out and buy anything with more power, but I still wish it had a little more umph! This is the reason for taking one star off.I wouldn't call the blower a \"leaf blower\" because it just doesn't have enough power to do a good job on blowing leaves off a lawn. The blower works fine for sidewalks and other hard surfaces. I use it after mowing and trimming the lawn.We live in a tract home. Our front yard is about 30' x 60' and our rear lawn is about 30' x 90'. I don't consider these lawns small by California standards. Due to these tools being cordless, and I also have a B&D; battery operated lawn mower, I can mow, trim, and blow off the sidewalks, patio, and driveway all within 20 minutes. I was never able to do that with corded electric tools or gas engine tools.For a typical mow, trim, and blow operation I use three batteries. One in the mower, one in the edge trimmer, and one in the blower.I often think, while using these tools, that I should run in and put a comment on Amazon - so today I finally did!!!
B00023RSUA I had purchased a grass hog like four or five years ago, and it worked well.  But when the batteries started not holding a charge well, I figured it was time to get a gas trimmer.  So I got one, a simple one that didn't need gas/oil mix, and immediately tore a hole in the siding at the bottom of my chimney the first time I used it.  Had more power, but I really hated how it threw the grass everywhere, trashing my shoes and pants.  So I went back to using the grass hog again, despite the batteries that didn't last.So I was about to purchase some batteries when I saw this deal pop up, and thought I'd go this route instead.  Wasn't that much more than just two batteries would've been, and I got a blower and a trimmer to boot.  Granted, I have no need for the hedge trimmer, and already have a powerful black and decker corded blower, but the cordless would be useful in some situations.Arrived quickly, unboxed, and my first disappointment was that the battery charger can't be mounted.  To me, for a unit designed to hang on the wall, that seems pretty stupid.  Also, as others have noted, it now only comes with two batteries, as described in the product details, not three as it used to.Hanging the rack was a piece of cake.  They use the types of drywall mounts I like, the large screw types that hold so securely, rather than the smaller ones that just have a little pop out in the back to keep them from pulling out.  So this thing mounts VERY well even if you don't get it in a stud.  Three screws to hold the metal bar to the wall, then four screws each for the individual hooks for each unit.As I said, I do have a corded B&D; blower, which works very well.  I knew this wouldn't match up to that, but it actually was even less than I had thought it would be.  I used it in my garage to blow out grass clippings and dust, and it worked fine for that, but anything else would've been pushing it.  Garage floor is smooth so things slid fine, but on my driveway, with the roughened surface of the concrete, it wasn't enough wind to dislodge the grass pieces from the rough surface.  This after being fully charged for about 16 hours.  But for small jobs, I will enjoy the convenience it provides of not dealing with power cords.Trimmer I can't attest to since I have no bushes, but it ran fine, not too noisy, and seems like it should do a fine job on them.The grass hog is a little different than the older one I had, but still the same basic functionality, and works just as well as the one I've been using for several years.  Nice to have new batteries again.Other than the underpowered blower and the inability to mount the battery charger, it was a good deal with the gold box offer, but as many have stated in their reviews, it's not for people with larger yards.
B00023RSUA I sure do love having this set in my shed.  I've used the blower extensively and the weed-whacker extensively.  I've never used the hedge trimmer, so I can't comment on that.Some perks..* it comes with two rechargeable batteries, which is super handy for heavy work days.  The battery charger also holds/chargers both batteries at the same time. Bonus.* Lightweight.  I never felt worn out carrying any of these around the lawn.* A wall mount with hooks comes with the set. So, I was able to hang these all neatly in my shed, just like in the photo.* Durable, good B&D; quality.The only bummer I've found with this set is that the leaf blower sucks the life out of the rechargeable batteries rather quickly.  So, don't dawdle when using the leaf blower.
B00023RSUA I just wanted to add my voice to those who felt that the battery life was insufficient.  After moving into a new home and using this set to catch up on a significant amount of neglected landscaping, we just felt that it didn't cut it.  We were swapping out the battery every 40 minutes or so (the saving grace was that there were 3 of them, so there was always another one ready to go--so long as you were using one machine at a time).  Also, I felt that the hedge-clipper and the blower were fairly weak at their intended purposes.  The hedge trimmer kept stalling and getting caught on the hedges.  The blower blows grass around--do not even think about using it on leaves.  I cannot speak for the weedwacker, as I was disappointed enough to return the set without even bothering to test it.
B00023RSUA I like these tools. They're plastic and run on batteries, but they work. Not as powerful as your gardener's gas powered machines, but for the homeowner who doesn't plan on any heavy duty shrubbery cleaning, these will do the trick nicely.
B00023RSUA I bought these shortly after buying Black & Decker's cordless electric lawn mower (which I also love), and I wasn't disappointed.The trimmer/hedge trimmer/blower work as you'd expect, the trimmer even features a telescoping body to adjust comfortably to your height. They are also relatively quiet and require no gasoline can or earplugs!The best part is that you get all three units for the price of just two of them sold separately! Plus, an unexpected but very welcome bonus is that this set comes with its own plastic mount for all three tools AND a separate mount for the batteries. I wouldn't have considered this a big selling point, had I read it, but having the ability to easily hang the tools in my garage out of the way and out of the reach of my kids is more valuable than I expected.Bravo Black & Decker!-1 star, however, because my package came with only two batteries (though to B&D;'s credit, they sent the third with minimal fuss once I contacted customer support).Oh, and once you buy these suckers, beware! Black & Decker have a whole product line of cordless drills, saws, sanders and other power tools that run on the 18-volt battery system, and once they pull you into the product line, all the other 18-volt products become pretty enticing!
B00023RSUA The easiest way to go., March 10, 2008By  P. Stein \"Bengals Fan\" (Beavercreek, OH) - See all my reviewsI previously purchased all three items separately. The broom works great on my outdoor carpet, and is much easier to use than a wet dry vac. Easily blows away lawn clippings. The hedge saw is much easier to use than my electric hedge saw, though not as powerful. Fair tradeoff. The trimmer works fine. Preferable to either gas or electric, though obviously less powerful. Again, a fair tradeoff. If you have to stop and recharge it, no big deal. I received a promotional radio/charger free. I just keep the battery in the radio charger, and it's always ready to use. Great for when you use a portable radio all day. Recommend you try to add the radio to your arsenal. I'm glad I purchased these items. It made my life easier.
B00023RSUA I had purchased a different yard combo about 2 month before and they where a piece af junk.  All the stuff ran for about 1 minute and then started running out of power.  The hedgers broke and I couldnt get them replaced.I wanted a set of these yard tools so I bought the Black and Decker set.  Yes the set was about 80.00 more and had less voltage but I was deturmined to get a cordless yard set.  When I received them the first thing I noticed was the construction was a lot better.  I charges them up over night and used the handy storage rack.  In the morning I got out the hedgers and trimmed up all my hedges on 1 battery then used the same battery and used the trimmer and then the blower all on the same battery.  WOW  The trimmers had more power then I expected, same with the blower.  I am very pleased with this set.  I recommend this set to anyone who is in the market for a cordless yard combo.
B00023RSUA First of all, this is a light duty set of tools.  If you've got a large lawn and garden to take care of, I think you'll be happier with a corded approach to electrical tools.  But I've found this perfect for my needs.  Each battery is perfectly capable of powering the blower for five minutes or so, and since you have three batteries you can clear quite a large area.  The clipper and trimmer are top notch and seem to run forever on one battery.  The blower is about half as powerful as the best corded models, but it's adequate for blowing junk over hard surfaces.
B00023RSUA My 11-year-old son will be helping me do the lawn work this summer.  To prepare him for this task, I bought this electric lawncare set so he wouldn't have the frustration of trying to start a balky gas edger/trimmer.The edger/trimmer works okay, but it has only one spool opening instead of the two opening like on my gas edger/trimmer.  The unit doesn't have much power to cut through very high weeds/grass or to sever the thick St. Augustine grass we have here in Florida.  But, with enough patience, it will eventually cut the thick grass shoots and does a good enough job with cutting just grass blades.  It's lightweight enough my son can use it without a problem.The blower is nice to have.  It doesn't have the power of a gas-powered blower, of course, but it has enough power to clear debris off the sidewalk or driveway.  Again, what you give up on in power you gain in convenience of having an electric-powered device.The hedge trimmer was a joy to use.  I can't believe I used my electric hedge trimmer for so long.  It's wonderful to be untethered to an electric extension cord!  The B&D; hedge trimmer cut effortless through my mature ficus hedge and it weighed no more than the corded hedge trimmer it replaced.Battery life is, generally, not real good.  I'd say that you can expect to get maybe 5 to 10 minutes of continuous use (such as when you're using the blower), or maybe 10 to 15 minutes of actual running time with intermittent breaks (such as when you're trimming).  On our 100x75 lot, one battery is needed to do all the lawn trimming, one battery is needed to do all the blowing, and one battery was sufficient to manicure the 6' hedge that runs about 30 feet on my front yard.In sum, I'm glad I got this set.  Having no cords or gas spills or troubles during start-up make it a pleasure to use.  I wish they had more power and long-lasting batteries, but I don't regret this purchase at all.
B00023RYS6 I inherited a Felco hand pruner from a dear friend who could not do any gardening any more due to health issues.  I knew they had to be good otherwise she would not give me an old pair of pruners. And boy, are they great!She had these pruners for a number of years, and they are still sharp and cut like new! I haven't had to sharpen them. They feel comfortable in my small hand.  They operate very smoothly, they lock very smoothly, much nicer compared to the others pruners I've used.  And they work!  I can cut through some thick branches with ease, despite being a relative weakling.If I ever needed another pair (even though I doubt this one will break) I would definitely buy Felco Hand Pruner.
B00023RYS6 I treated myself to a new pair of these a few years ago...good investment!There is simply no substitution for quality.  I have been using the Felco pruner for years; more years than I can remember and these tools are the best of the best.  Yes, you pay more for them but it is well worth the extra cost.There are a few things to remember about these wonderful tools:First, they are a bit prone to rust.  Most good pruning tools have this in common as it is the steel that they are made from that does it.  I have found that simply wiping them off with a paper towel and then wiping them down with an oily rag after use will pretty well take care of the problem.  It is interesting to note that I bought a pair of these pruners a few years ago at an auction.  They were ancient and completely covered with rust. I paid .25 cents for them.  A bit of rust remover, oil and elbow grease along with a good sharpening had them working like new in no time.  I still use them.Secondly, these pruners are easy to take apart and it is very easy to replace any part.  This is particularly handy when it comes to the blade.  To keep these instruments in top working order they need to be kept sharp.  The scissors action is far superior to the anvil type in both easy of cutting and less damage to the plant.  They must be kept shape though. Fortunately this is not difficult but it is the nature of any blade that eventually you will not be able to sharpen it and it will have to be replaced.  This is a snap.Thirdly, I have noted from working with others and talking to others that the major reason for dissatisfaction with this tool or any such pruner is that it will not \"cut.\"  Upon examination I have found that the reason for this not cutting is almost invariably the fact that people ask the pruner to do more than it was built to do...i.e. trying to cut limbs that are too large.  This is NOT a lopper.  This is not a cross cut or a chain saw!  It has its limitations!  Use the proper tool for the job and there is seldom a problem.Fourth, the model being reviewed here could indeed, as pointed out by several reviewers, be too large for smaller hands.  I suggest a smaller model.  They cut as well and fit the hand better.  They simply cannot cut as large a limb or twig as this one does.Fifth, you can indeed buy pruners for as little as five bucks...you can buy dozens and dozens of them over the years; and trust me, if you use them a lot, you will be buying replacements constantly.  Overall, it is far more economical to go ahead and buy the best, as represented here, and have something that if taken care of, will last far longer than you will.This is a good tool and if it is taken care of and not abused, it will last you a lifetime.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks
B00023RYS6 I haven't owned these long enough to know how they will stand the test of time, but they seem very well made, have a sharp blade, are comfortable, and have smooth action.  I like that you can swap out the blade after you've sharpened it too many times.  Mine came with a tiny tool that can be used to take apart the pruners, replace the blade, etc.  Seems like something that will be lost instantly.  Would have appreciated it if they had designed this to store on the pruner body somehow.  Also, the aluminum is roughed up a bit towards the tip of the pruner.  I am assuming this is part of manufacturing process but it looks more like someone drug it on the concrete or something.  The rest of the tool is finished nicely.
B00023RYS6 These pruners are, of course, classic. Thousands of excellent reviews, storied history and millions of happy customers.I am not one of them.The F-2 can cut through all sorts of plants without difficulty thanks to the brilliantly sharp blades. These are excellent for ornamental gardening, but I find them unpleasantly dangerous and annoying for vegetable gardening.Cutting vegetable matter (raspberry canes, garlic stems, squash branches, etc.) quickly results in a gummy blade that does not open/close well. Obviously cleaning fixes that, but most people, including me, don't typically garden with a rag in hand. Further, cleaning the sharp blade becomes a dangerous proposition and has resulted in cuts as the blade slices through the rag to the skin.I spend my time working in the kitchen with sharp knives and in a wood shop with heavy machinery including many types of power saws - I've never had similar fear of lacerations in either location.This is also not a tool I feel safe allowing anywhere near my child. He's spent enough time in the garden that he knows how to use and treat properly pruners (with constant supervision.) I won't let him touch these.
B00023RYS6 Clearly of quality construction, but far too expensive given options that are available.  Mine were stolen from my garage, and I replaced them with a two-piece combo purchased at Costco for $19.00.  They come with a life-time replacement guarantee. The $19 item cuts just as well as the Felco and is equally comfortable to hold and use.
B00023RYS6 The most used garden tool is the pruners.  Cutting your plants back, you should make a clean cut as to not stunt their growth.  Again as things like small branches and trees grow you have to prune them back so this tool works great.  I work HVAC and always have a branch up my butt and love these to cut back plants around the condenser.  Buy it you'll love them.  As what people said about rust, these are make of steel and they do get a little rust but nothing big.  Stainless is a soft metal and would not work.
B00023RYS6 This pruner is so easy to use. It comes with a wrench and instructions on how to replace the blade. The cutting action is very smooth and the price I paid for this pruner was well worth it.
B00023RYS6 My mom owns a garden design and maintenance business.  I never really took interest in it until my wife and I purchased our first home.  As expected, we are now avid gardeners and landscapers.I really like Fiskars and had a set of them along with a cheap set from Target on hand.  My mom recommended that we step up to Felco Pruners.  She noted how she's had her set for over a decade and either takes them in for sharpening or orders new blades. They are built for life.I keep mine in my house with my nice knives.The motion is fluid and exact.  The cut is fine and thorough.  The ergonomics are spot-on.  I cannot find a weak point or complaint.  Be sure to buy the leather belt holster as well.Felco is a Swiss company that specializes in one thing for over 60 years - cutting tools.I wish I bought these sooner.
B00023RYS6 Works well and make each job so much easier.  Would recommend. Handle is comfortable which is so important during cutting.
B00025H2PY I purchased this product because I have a well and did not want to contaminate my drinking water, yet, I needed some type of insect intervention. After some flubs trying to apply it properly, I found it to be highly effective, yet non-toxic (so far!).The thing you will need to be aware of is that this stuff has the consistency of flour. It is very \"fluffy\" and coats things (this is how it kills insects). Orginally, my plan was to mix it with water and spray it. Unfortuntely, I purchased a stand alone sprayer which you prime manually to pressurize. Despite mixing this in the suggested 1 cup per gallon ratio (which I read about online), the stuff instantly gunked my sprayer and spoiled my visions of prancing around like Bill Murray in Ghost Busters (only for bugs).I ended up just using my hand and sprinkling it around my foundation outside. It was sort fo a messy and time consuming job, but I am already seeing good results. I have not had a single carpenter ant in my house since I did this, which is great.This product is costly. It is the food grade quality that makes it more expensive I believe. Please be aware that there are other versions of DE that may be cheaper, but be careful. Some, particularly Pool grade, is carcinogenic to humans and will not kill bugs. There is another type sold labeled as a garden product, but that contains added chemicals and bug attractants, which I was unsure about having possibly enter my ground water.
B00025H2PY This is a high quality food grade DE and is labeled as such .  Believe it is the finest powder I have ever purchased and is rated the purest I have found .  My wife and I use it internally, plus I use it on the yard, under my home, garden and my large dog pens .  It works well in my Dustin Miser (sold on Amazon) , producing a very fine cloud of DE dust .  Because it is a very fine powder it coats things well and kills ticks, fleas, Colorado potato bug larva, most ants, and even most hard shell pests . People don't think DE will kill hard shell pests but even they have connecting membranes between the hard shell parts, and legs that can be damaged or cut . This product was shipped FAST and I highly recommend it and this seller to anyone .
B00025H2PY I could not find food-grade diatomaceous earth anywhere locally. Most places had no idea what I was even talking about. I have a relative who lives in a low-income building that has repeatedly been infested with bed bugs. Although they have had professional pest control in several times, they always seem to survive. Tenants are forbidden to use any poisons due to their many tenants with health problems. This diatomaceous earth seems to have solved his problem in his apartment and he's now sharing the secret with his neighbors!This product was a good price; several dollars cheaper than similar products. Shipping was also more reasonable than others. And service was fast-it arrived in little over a week. I will buy from this seller again, should the need arise.
B00025H2PY I have been mixing a heaping tablespoon of diatomaceous earth (food grade) into my morning coffee every morning for one full month.  I cannot say I have noticed any physical changes for the better.  I have not experienced any of the following that so many other people say they have experienced while using this product:No improvement in skin conditionNo loss or lightening of pigmented spotsNo improvement in joint functionsNo regrowth of eyebrow hairNo increase in energyNo regularity in BMNo improvement in tooth enamelNo passing of internal parasitesNo improvement in hair and nail growthNo weight lossThere is nothing that I can honestly say is a positive improvement to my health after taking DE for a month.  I'm not saying it won't help you in these areas since so many others have seen great improvements in their health,  but either I am super healthy already (which is definitely not the case) or it simply isn't doing me any particular good.  Not everything works for everybody.  I am concerned about how radioactive it is and when I can remember to ask my husband to bring home the office geiger counter I will get him to test it for that and report back.  I have no idea exactly where they dug this DE up and it could be near leaking nuclear power plants or next door to radio active waste dumps for all I know.  I sure hope not though.UPDATE: 4.25.14This past week-end my husband tested the diatomaceous earth with a geiger counter and found no significant radiation beyond background radiation.  This is good news for those who consume a lot of it.
B00025H2PY We drink it and use it to control household 'bugs'. Helps with aches & pains as well as hair and nail health. I discovered this after using DE for years to control insects in the house.
B000279304 I like the spikes. It makes keeping my plants in good shape so much easier than mixing a fluid mix. Just pop it in and you're good to go!
B000279304 wow! I just may have green thumb, brought jobes and I'm already seeing improvements!!!! especially with potho's,will continue to use every 60 days!!!! hope they continue to grow all 26 of them!!!
B000279304 My wife and I have been using Jobe's houseplant food spikes for more years than I can remember; of course we have been raising houseplant for more years than I can remember too so I suppose that works out well.I can honestly say that over these many years that we have never once been dissatisfied with this product and much prefer it to the various liquids we have used from time to time.  Now we have lost house plants; make no mistake about that, but it has never been due to this product.  Normally I am the culprit in that I tend to overwater our plants and overwatering is the number one cause of houseplant loss.  You would think I would learn....These are easy to use and easy to monitor.  Depending upon the size to the pot being used, we adjust the number of spikes used.  The spikes are always placed as far from the roots as possible and buried to their full length.  Yes, the finally disappear in about two months.  Now you do not want to over do it as any plant food can burn the roots if over used but I will say that it is more difficult to do that dastardly deed with these spikes than many other form of food we have used.  They are easy to use, store well and we have had no problem finding them (to purchase) in the different area of the country we have lived.As to the amount used, the frequency used and matters such as they, it is best to do a bit of research on each plant you own.  Plants, like people, are different and they all have specific needs.  You can pretty well figure out what your plant needs via research and pure observation.It should also be noted that if you take advantage of the super saver offer here that the price Amazon is asking is more than reasonable...actually it is about half of what we pay her locally.This is a good product and we have been extremely happy with it all these years.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks
B000279304 My biggest challenge will be not losing these in the back of a drawer somewhere before I use them all up.
B000279304 Plant spikes have been around for just about as long as house plants have.  They are one of the oldest ways of fertilizing potted plants as there is going. (Someone with roots in their blood once told me that solid fertilizer preceded the liquid variety by quite a respectable amount of time.  The liquid variety being easier, but not necessarily better).  A lot of folks don't seem to use them anymore since liquid fertilizers mixed with your regular watering are so much easier.  My own experience with both is that the solid, slow dissolving spikes last longer, feed the plant the nutrients more efficiently over the longer amount of time, and genuinely do a better job of giving your plants the extra boost of good stuff all house plants can use. I am not a horticulturist and certainly do not claim to know this is a fact over a reasonable theory.  What I do know is I have some of the biggest, healthiest house plants I have witnessed among my many peers that dabble in the home spun gardening trade as well.  I stopped using liquid fertilizers years ago and have had excellent results with these spikes.  You thumb them down just under the surface every couple of months and watch your house plants love you for it.  I highly recommend the Jobe fertilizer spikes, and, I also recommend that if you can't or don't care to locate them locally, that you buy them in bulk here on Amazon and make the shipping worth it.  Made them part of a bundle package with something else and they ship for free at the time of this writing.  Try them for just one or two of your plants and see if they don't make you smile...
B000279304 My gardening over the past 20+ years is strictly self-taught.  What I do know is that for years I have used Jobe&#8217;s spikes when initially planting anything, whether in the ground or in pots, as an aid to help them thrive, and they do.  For potted plants, I usually put a couple more in every year.  For me this is an easy as well as effective way to fertilize.  At the current $1.97 for 50 spikes, they are very competitively priced.
B000291GBQ bought this to replace an older burner that died.. this thing packs some heat.  the legs are sturdy the hose is plenty long
B000291GBQ Fired this burner up this weekend and it seemed to run great.  Flame is control is acceptible and you can turn it down low if you need to.  I recommend running it hot before putting a pot on to burn the paint off in the flame path.  The paint burning left some marks on the bottom of my pot which were hard to get off but its not a big deal.
B000291GBQ I've been using these for years and need another one.  I saw this on Amazon and scooped it up right away.  Killer price with free shipping.  Check the prices on this at your local stores and you'll see what I mean.  This high pressure cooker is what I use to cook big pots of food outside.  Like steaming crabs, gumbo, soups, stews, deep frying - - you name it.  It's made strong, for heavy pots.
B000291GBQ I purchased this to brew my batches of beer outside during the summer months (it gets too hot inside having a pot boil for so long..and my wife doesn't like the smell either). I was very pleased at the quality of construction and the ease of using this. After setting it up and testing for leaks using soapy water...I was ready to go.  As others have mentioned, the paint does burn off many places during its first use. I didn't buy this to look pretty...I want it to brew beer...and fast. And fast brewing it certainly does. After using it a few times, I feel more comfortable cranking it up to high. Definitely watch out as boil overs are much easier than on an inside burner. Overall though, I would estimate almost half an hour is saved by using this burner vs. the stove (I do partial mashes only). Good investment for any home brewer...and it can double as burner for frying turkeys!
B000291GBQ [Update June 11, 2012: I'm still using the Bayou cooker several times a week]I bought this for two reasons:1) If it's hot out, I'd rather not heat up the house.2) I can't stand frying indoors.  I don't like the odors and I don't want oil/grease in the house.  We don't have a big outdoor vented hood in the kitchen.  Now I'm able to fry outdoors much of the year.It's a very simple unit.It's light-weight and very portable.  The propane tank weighs far more that the cooker.I use the cooker for wok cooking.  Although I have a very good gas kitchen stove, none of the burners give off nearly as much heat as this Bayou cooker.  At full blast, the Bayou cooker makes a whooshing sound like the gas units used in Chinese restaurants.The reason why I rated it 5 stars is price per performance.  I'm not comparing this unit to more expensive units.
B000291GBQ This is a very useful outdoor gas cooker. Very rugged and well made. I use it a lot and have been great so far. Good price too.
B0002HSFBC I bought a stove top smoker a few years ago and although I do not use it everyday, I do tend to use it quite often. The problem is that I cannot find the fine wood chips at the regular stores like Wal-mart or Target. These store usually have the really large chips or blocks but not the fine dust like chips one needs for this type of smoker. I have looked at other online stores and found the chips but they were more expensive than at Amazon. What I also like is that this particular pack of chips has an assortment for using with various different meats such as for smoking fish, pork chops, etc. Also, since the smoker I have is a Cameron brand, this is perfect. I especially like the alder for Salmon.
B0002HSFBC The small shaved size of these wood chips are perfect for a stove top smoker or any light smoking job. The chips smoked nicely with no off or greasy oily residue. I really loved the Cherry but all four were great. I smoked cheese, garlic, and salmon and the taste was fabulous.
B0002HSFBC These chips are exactly as described, and work perfectly.  No complaints, no confusion, no aggravation.  Isn't it great when a description fits perfectly?
B0002HSFBC stovetop smoking:  even the Li'l Smokey can do half a bird or a steak and give you that surprise smokey experience.
B0002HSFBC These work great in my stove top smoker and are cheap enough where you can try several types of wood out to see what impact they have on flavor.
B0002IKUE6 The hose is good quality, and it appears to not be kink-able.  The all-important connectors are very good quality, and appear to be well connected.
B0002IKUE6 I like this hose. It is a dedicated hose for flushing my black tank. Works very well and seems to be a good build, good quality, good price, and works great. Will update PRN.
B0002IKUE6 I wish I'd ordered the 75-foot version since 25' isn't long enough! The cardboard label also says NOT APPROVED FOR SALE IN CALIFORNIA or something like that. So maybe the Hose Police will come and get me and drag me away. It's surprisingly lightweight and seems very flexible, then again it's brand new, and the 10-year old hoses this is replacing were supple, once, too. I can see ordering a second 25' length, since 25' is actually not enough to reach anywhere in my tiny yard.
B0002IKUE6 This is a sturdy hose, with thick tubing walls and solid brass fittings. It can kink under certain motions but not esaily -- call it kink resistant but not never-kink. My previous hose burst at a kink point, but this one seems much thicker and reinforced, and less likely to give way in that manner. I like using it just fine.
B0002IKUE6 Just as i hoped - this is a fantastic buy - did not leak and is working well so far. Just get it. Small reminder that 25 feet is a small length.
B0002IKUE6 I used this over the summer and it never tangled.  It is a lot heavier than my other cheap hoses.  I will be buying more of these.
B0002IQ96Y My husband really likes this because, he said it covers a good amount of the lawn and he doesn't have to move it so often.  It adjusts easily, its sturdy and our grandkids had fun cooling off on those hot days too!
B0002IQ96Y There were forest fires around us last summer and I had a couple of these around.  I set them up to water out in the fields around us.  They worked so well that I bought 6 more just for this purpose.  As I am driving around my area; I see that I am not the only one who uses them.  They are sturdy, don't leak for the most part and the sprinkler head is of decent quality.  Unlike some other tripods, the sprinkler can be replaced with another if needed.  They will fall over if you have a decent windy day.  So, you should check on them occasionally.
B0002IQ96Y Forget those spikes that bend or break when you shove them into hard ground this is the ticket and even if the sprinkler head should fail its easy to take off and replace . How do I know that you ask ?? I was getting water from a lake and the intake  hose sucked mud so I had to clean and replace the sprinkler.  But all in all love the stand
B0002IQ96Y The travel settings are very difficult to use and it often sticks.  It also sprays as much water out the side as forward.  The tripod is the only good thing about this sprinkler.
B0002IQ96Y Great product.  I have at least ten of these.  I wish I could buy the tripod without the brass sprinkler head.  I replace those with Naan quiet heads.  I hope Orbit maintains the quality.  The two I bought yesterday seem to have cheaper connector.
B0002IU8K2 I had used rockwool, but after reading some reviews thought I'd give these a try.They keep an even dampness better than rockwool. Rockwool can easily get drenched, but these seem to keep just the right amount of moisture.When I first got them I was surprised how much they looked like moist chocolate brownie cake. Even the spongy feel made me think &#34;This must be delicious&#34;. I never caved into that temptation, but to this day they still look and feel more appetizing than most brownies. I give a star for that alone.They also fit perfectly in the &#34;Hydrofarm CK64060 Hot House with Heat Mat,&#34; which is convenient.
B0002IU8K2 i wish the hole was a little smaller for my more delicate clones but for the thicker root plants it works great!
B0002IU8K2 These fit plastic trays available at WalMart and Home Depot. Easy to water and can plant entire plug without damage to seedling roots.
B0002IU8K2 I'VE USED THESE EXCLUSIVELY FOR STARTING SEEDS. SO FAR, I HAVE AN ALMOST 100% SUCCESS RATE (I'VE KILLED SOME SEEDLINGS ON REPLANTING, THOUGH). VERY CONVENIENT AND EASY TO USE.
B0002IU8K2 I bought these after much research about cloning.  It seems that these come the most recommended from experienced growers.  In a humidity dome my clones took root after about 7 days with a 100% success rate.  I have also started some bell pepper seeds with rapid success.  Would highly recommend to anyone.
B0002IU8K2 Man these are great I mean great never had roots to shoot out and so bog in such a short time less then 8 days from cuttings to rooted plants going to transplant them all into larger pots today I'll never not use these again great things they are
B0002IU8UW as described, came quick, no issues
B0002IU8UW I received the Grodan rockwool 1.5 inch cubes with 45 cubes in the package. Following their directions, the cubes have worked well in starting my chard seeds for my hydroponics garden. Though I haven't seen anyone else mention this, I noticed that once the chard plants were full-sized and had well-established roots directly in the hydroponics solution, the chard appeared to prefer my leaving the rockwood cubes dry so they could stand up better.
B0002IU8UW These rockwool cubes are a good way to start cuttings. Light, sterile, easy to handle and affordable. They do the trick.
B0002IU8UW I compared this to to peat pellets for rooting a camilea from cuttings.  These had a higher success rate than the peat pellets.
B0002IU8UW Been using rockwool cubes for cuttings for a long time now. Have always had good luck them them. I normally start seeing roots after about a week for most of my cuttings.
B0002IU8UW These work very well, I think.  My seedlings came up just fine and without any issues.  A recommended buy.  Thank you.
B0002XK0IC I've always wanted a smoker, but wasn't willing to spend the money on a top of the line model. Plus, being a bit of a lazy cook, I wanted to get something that didn't involve a lot of fuss and muss.So, when I saw this Brinkman electric smoker, I thought I'd give it a shot. While Amazon is my usual place to shop, I have to confess I got this from the big box home improvement store (\"depot\"). They had it on the web site for less than half the Amazon price with free shipping. Plus had a coupon that took several more dollars off the price. Couldn't pass it up. Granted, the one I got did not include the cover, but that's not a problem since it will get stored in a sheltered area.The construction quality is not what you would call top-notch, but acceptable for the price. Assembly is straightforward - need a screwdriver and pliers. You will also need to season the smoker before using it for real. Simple process - just coat the inside with vegetable oil and then run it for 3 or so hours.Easy to use and the food is wonderful. I mean wonderful!! And so easy - basically just fill the pan with water, put in some wood chunks, put on the food and leave it alone for a few hours. That's the type of cooking I like!Clean up is a bit more involved since you have to clean the water pan and the grates. But both fit into the dishwasher, so I only have to wait for things to cool then toss them in for cleaning.I'm sure the smoking purists will scoff at the idea of an electric model, and the more expensive ones will probably last longer and work better. I'm also sure that this does not have the power to work well in very cold temperatures. But for summertime smoking, you can't get better than this for the money (assuming you get it at the depot) . Highly recommend!Note: I was also very impressed by the customer service from Brinkman. The water pan had a big dent in it from shipping (the depot shipped it in just the manufacturer box, and it must of taken a hit from UPS). The dent was deep enough that it cracked the metal, and I was concerned about long-term leaks and rust. I called Brinkman and five days later, a new water pan arrived via FedEx. No hassles, no forms, just quick, polite, effective service. Rare to find that these days.
B0002XK0IC I have had mine for 3 years now and love it. The assembly is minimal and the seasoning prcedure makes all the parts stay in great shape. I do a fair amount of smoking of meats (weekly) and it has been performing well. I have not modified it and manage the internal heat by using the right amount of charcoal and monitoring the unit every 20-30 minutes. Having worked with experienced Pit Masters, they all say the same thing. You have to pay attention to your fire, lift the lid as little as possible, monitor the temp, add more as needed. The only downside, true for all the water-smokers (hence 4 instead of 5) is adding can be challenging but not impossible. Patience is required. Would I buy it again, yes. Most of my smoking is done between 200-225F, and it does from ribs and whole turkeys very well. Even smoked a meatloaf! MMMMMMMMMM
B0002XK0IC I have had 2 of these.  Lost the first one in a divorce.  Had it for many years.  Replaced heating element twice, possibly my fault for not cleaning it.  Body and grills never rusted.  Did an excellent job smoking tons of food.  Decided to order the new one.  Love that you can place the grill on the smoker barrel for height when grilling, no more grilling on the ground.  Also stoked about the added door for refilling water and adding chips.  Assembly was quick and easy.Was disappointed to see the dome is scratched in multiple places, and the water bowl had several dents in it.  One of the dents was so deep I am surprised it did not make a hole, but the paint is gone around the dents and continuing to flake.  Not bad enough damage to warrant packing it back up and sending it back, but still disappointed with the result.There was no apparent damage to the packing material, so assuming it looked that way when placed in the box.
B0002XK0IC Though the design of this unit is pretty good for the money, the cheap Chinese manufacturing makes it a waste of money.  Out of the box the powder coating paint was damaged both on the lid and the water basin.  Though this may having been from shipping, there was no evidence of any rough handling.Along similar lines, assembly of this unit is pretty tedious.  Lots of very small nuts and bolts that have to be applied.  The second evidence of cheap Chinese manufacturing was that one 1 of the three handles went on correctly.  The tolerances for the mounting holes in the handles were off, requiring me to have to force the bolts into them, and bend the handles to make them fit.I would recommend that you consider a more expensive gas or charcoal smoker.  If for no other reason, the electric version is not water resistant.  What do you do if you have it out on the deck or patio, smoking some meat and it starts raining?  You don't have many options.I contacted the manufacturer about it arriving with damage.  They suggested that I buy replacement parts from them.I recommend that you buy a traditional wood fired smoker.
B0002XK0IC I chose this smoker mainly because I found it on sale at one of the home improvement warehouses for only $69.00!.  I chose electric because I like the idea that the temp remains constant.  The downside is that the temp is not adjustable.  On a cool day the temp seems to hover at 225 F which is nice for longer smokes.  The documentation says it should be smoking between 250F - 275F.  I don't think it can get that high because of some minor issues in its shape.The smoker has no intentional venting.  However, the drum of my unit is not perfectly round; it is oblong.  This causes two gaps about 12\" in length and about 1/4\" wide at its widest point.  At first I was concerned with this, but after tasting a brisket and 2 chickens I have smoked, I like the results.I have yet to try the unit on a hot day so it will be interesting to see what the temperature rises to.  I also wish the unit was built with a thermometer to read the temp.If you can find one of these for cheap, grab it.  This is a great intro unit to smoking.  I hope I get 3-5 years out of it and then I will upgrade to an insulated unit (if I am still smoking.BTW, this can double as a small grill.UPDATE:  Okay, 6 years later I am on my second Brinkmann.  About 2 years ago the heating coil broke and I had to replace the whole smoker.  I actually go a deal at one of the home improvement store by taking their floor model that was missing the water basin.  Got the replacement unit for $49.  I have been smoking now for 6 years and I love it.  Here is what I have found out about this unit over the last 6 years:1. Temperature remains pretty constant.  The key is the water basin.  On a long smoke, when I do a 10- 14 lb brisket. I usually have to refill the water basin.  This can be tricky because the basin sits under your meats.  Try to position your meats so that there is room to add water, or use a funnel and open the side door.  Always add hot water when you fill the basin.  Adding cold water causes the temp to drop in the unit (the basin is absorbing the heat)2. There is not enough room to do ribs laying flat unless you cut off the tip.3. I have trouble getting briskets up to the optimal temp 185-190 unless I wrap it and put it in the oven at the end.I still think this is a great entry level smoker and while I am now looking to move up to something else (probably a green egg), I love this little guy.  The consistency in temp and the inexpensive price make this a great smoker to learn the basics on.
B0002YTO7E This is a great hatchet that Paul would have liked to have had in his wood choppers tool box. There was a heavy storm in these parts fairly recently with very strong winds that knocked down many trees. Two of my neighbors trees fell into my yard and tore up my cedar fence. I also had my largest hardwood tree get blown over in my backyard where it fell without causing any damage. I sure wish Paul was available to help me out. Instead of Paul, this Fiskars hatchet came to the rescue in helping to clear up this big mess. Yes, I had to use a chainsaw as well when it came to cutting up the tree trunks. But the hatchet made short work of chopping up a lot of the branches. The hatchet has a nice heft and a comfortable grip. The blade stayed sharp far longer than I had anticipated. This is a must have tool to keep at hand. A great tool and a great price...
B0002YTO7E Perfect little hatchet for small needs, excellent construction and the wife just luvs it, and if she luvs it, then I luv it, for nothing better than coming home to a fire in the wood-stove :)
B0002YTO7E I have really come to love the Fiskars tools.  I bought a post hole digger which is head and shoulders better than everything else, and this hatchet is the same way.  It is different than others in many ways.  It looks different and honestly a bit fragile. However it is one tough mother.  The lightweight handle gives you more head speed, which translates into deeper cuts per chop.  The angle of the blade and the non-stick coating really slices through wood.  The way the blade is attached provides no place for the head to bind up in the wood which again allows you to cut deeper.  I am buying one of the axes in this line too.  Awesome tool.
B0002YTO7E The blade is sharp and the construction is solid. It is small light enough to take on trips yet still able to cut through wood quickly. I would recommend this to anyone with a need for a hatchet.
B0002YTO7E I purchased theFiskars 7884 X27  36-Inch Super Splitting Axe, and was very impressed with it, so I thought I would give the hatchet a try. It is great, the blade is heavier than other blades, which helps build up the momentum and splits the wood nicely.  I like the plastic handle because it feels a little more durable than a wood handle.
B0002YTO7E I give this product 4 stars because I really don&#8217;t use it much.  I do recommend this product and especially this manufacturer if you are looking for this kind of tool.  It&#8217;s well made, lightweight and holds a good edge and of course, it chops wood well...
B0002YTO7E I bought this because I was so please with my other Fiskars ax.  It certainly lived up to my expectations.  Solidly build with an unbreakable handle and holds a great edge.
B0002YTO7E This little  hatchet has a well balanced feel when swinging and is great for chopping kindling and small firewood. Looks well made and would recommend it
B0002YTO7E The hatchet is just the right size and comes with a safety cover which was a nice surprise.  It has a good grip and feel.  Like all fiskars products I feel confident in using it due to their lifetime warranty.  I would definitely buy/ recommend this hatchet.
B0002YTO7E great quality and balance. I'm not really into writing the product reviews so adding this filler to satisfy the required number of works.
B0002YTO7E I started buying Fiskars products for my floral business.The small pruners were exactly what I needed for delicate flowers.I was impressed by how easy they were to handle & super sharp.Next was to buy larger  pruners,then moved to gardening Fiskars etc. Just loved the sharpness and design.We recently bought a wood stove for our stand alone cabin/guest house& my husband needed more wood split than the usual fireplace wood.I got the axe,then he had to cut some &#34;splinters&#34; for starting the woodstove.This axe perfectly fits the bill ! .It is lightweight,extremely sharp,easy to maneuver,and once again,Fiskars,still made in Sweden(maybe Finland)produces far superior results.Top quality,lifetime guarantee,great addition.Can't find a fault,including a very fair price.
B0002YTO7E This stays sharp and never lets me down.  It is light weight and the head is very secure...it won't work loose over time like some wood-handled hatchets.
B0002YTO7E I like virtually everything Fiskars makes, and this little axe is no exception.  Kept sharp, it cuts any wood briskly and evenly.
B0002YTO7E You will not be disappointed with any Fiskars product, and no, I do not work for the company. Wish I did. All the Fiskars axes adn hatchets are wonderful. I went a little crazy a few months ago and ordered about one of every size axe/hatchet that Fiskars make and I love each one equally. The handle, the look, the design, the price. This is a top of the line product. Anything else other than a a Fiskars is a waste of your time and money. Ohhh, Just had a thought....I did buy the Fiskars sharpening tool as well. The Fiskars sharpening tool is a piece of junk. It broke when I tried to use it the first time and I was completely unimpressed, but I did not return it to the vendor, too much hassle. The axes/hatchets are GREAT though and you will love them.
B0002YTVJA These pads are useful where you must be on your knees a lot.  If you must clean up, work on the car, or other activities where you must kneel, then having one or more of these pads might be a good idea.
B0002YTVJA This pad could be larger and thicker. It seems a little overpriced for what you get. When they say ultra light, they aren't kidding. I also left this outside for a couple of days by mistake. It survived, but was the worse for wear.
B0002YTVJA This kneeling cushion was used for the sole purpose of gardening. The foam may be water resistant, but it is not very thick and your knees can feel the sticks underneath it. The foam does not have a protective coating like other kneeling pads I have used, and therefore it takes the shape of whatever it is sitting on (for instance your knees and sticks below your pad). The kneeling pad could be improved for gardening; therefore, I would not recommend this product for gardening.
B0002YTVJA well what can I say about kneeling mats other than I really like it. Right size and glad I was able to find this color. I use it all the time and it looks like it will last me a long time. Others I've bought before only lasted a year before falling apart. So far so good.
B0002YTVJA Yes, it's just a piece of foam with a hole in it, but it's light, it's tough, and it makes working on your knees much easier. I suppose you could recycle an old foam camping mattress into several kneepads,, but if you don't already have one to recycle, this works just fine.
B0002YVDSW I at first was disappointed with the item when I pulled it out of the box as it is VERY light. But don't let that fool you: this trowel is very strong and perfect for loosing up weeds (in between flagstone or in gravel), mild digging (2-4&#34; rocks) and full potting. I am going to buy another for my Grandma as this item is so light it will be perfect for her. I imagine it cannot handle excessive force, but given it's weight it is pound-for-pound as strong if not stronger than a metal or other material counterpart. PLUS it can't rust, which is great for me since I live near the ocean.
B0002YVDSW I was disappointed since I thought it would be stronger. I still use metal trowel for digging when durability of a tool is needed.
B0002YVDSW For some reason this was going for a very low price - I bought it because of that and only afterwards learned how nice a lightweight trowel it so have!
B0002YVDSW I am not happy with this trowel because it bends when digging in hard/compacted soil. I suppose if you have sandy loam...you might be good. Not for me.
B0002YVDSW Seems like every other week or so it randomly drops to 84 cents as an add on item. You simply cannot beat that price. I got several for my son and his friends to play with in the dirt and some for the front and back yard. It is a ridged plastic but dug fine in hard dirt for me. Don't go prying up rocks or it might break but for general digging it is just fine. But you can abuse it all you want and if it does break you are out less than $1.
B0002YVDSW This is a pretty cheap and lightweight trowel.  It is made from heavy duty plastic.  The tip chips a bit when used with rocks, but is perfectly fine for everyday use.  It seems nice and strong.  The handle does not bend.
B0002YVDSW I bought two trowels from Amazon, one with a really big scoop and this one.  I use this for my smaller plantings.  It is well made and that is true with Fiskars.  You can count on that manufacturer to sell a good product.  It is small and that is what I was looking to buy.
B0002YVDSW One day I couldn't find my old garden trowel (a neighbor had borrowed it for concrete!) so I ordered this one. What a difference the lightness alone makes! A GREAT product.
B0002YVDSW I needed a trowel that was non metallic for digging in dirt when treasure hunting.  As long as you're not digging in extremely hard dirt, this works just fine.  I don't use it for anything other than this so can't comment for gardening use but I'd say it probably would work just fine.
B0002YVDSW What do i like about this, it's great for light work.  Like planting small seeds where you sprinkle them and I also like it that it wont rust.  I wouldn't even think about chopping stuff with this, but it is a good tool in the gardners box.  But the price verys so much I got this for a one buck as an add on item.  Don't pay to much for this.
B0002YVDSW While not as strong as a trowel made of metal, Fiskars 7978 Composite Trowel is still strong enough to handle basic gardening tasks.  Made out of a composite plastic called `FiberComp', the tool is very lightweight.  The blade is oversized, quite wide, and appears to be quite sturdy.  The rock solid handle is probably the strongest part of the tool, and snapping the blade off would take a great deal of force.  The handle has a spot on the top for your thumb, and a slot at the end for hanging.This tool will not corrode, and if not abused, it should last for a long while.  The price at Amazon is a little steep, so may want to check your local hardware store for a better deal.
B0002YVE54 Occaisionally this drop to less than $1. I ordered a couple as it was so cheap. I use it a bit in the garden but it is also great for kids to use in the sand or dirt.
B0002YVE54 It feels light in my hand and this composite material is so strong, I've never had a problem with any of these tools.  Since it is so light it seems like there is less stress on my forearm/wrist as opposed to the heavier metal one I was using before.
B0002YVE54 I wanted a non metallic tool when treasure hunting with my metal detector.  This won't set off my pinpointer and perfect for loose dirt and/or getting debris out of the way on the ground.  It's light weight so easy to carrry.  I'd use it for gardening around the home but for me flowers are nothing more than something to aim for with my mower ... so really not used for the \"proper\" purposes!
B0002YVE54 excellent tools as are all the Fiskar tools I've purchased.... for non-metallic tools, they are very nice and strong, non-magnetic tools......
B0002YVE54 Fiskars 7977 Composite Cultivator is certainly not as strong as a similar cultivator made of metal, but it's stronger than you might expect, and is a tool that is well-suited for light duty gardening.  Made out of a very stiff composite plastic called `FiberComp', tool is very lightweight.  The handle is rock solid, and while much thinner, the tines are surprisingly hard as well.  While this tool is most useful in soil that contains some moisture and is somewhat soft, it is capable of more rugged performance.  The handle has a spot on the top for your thumb, and a slot at the end for hanging.This tool will not corrode, and if used properly and not abused, it should last for some time.  The price at Amazon is a little steep, so may want to check your local hardware store for a better deal.
B0002ZINDY Earlier this fall, after a very expensive service call from a plumber, I found out that some creature chewed through the rubber tubes of my forced air heating system (plumber left me a chewed tube as evidence). I recall seeing some dropping in the basement, they did not look like mouse dropping (tubes rather than balls), so I got both a mouse trap and rat/chipmunk trapBig Snap-E Rat Trapas I don't want to have another service call.I am attaching a photo of both next to each other for size reference (I was wondering about this before buying both).  This weekend I set them both up, and they were fairly easy to set up. The instructions did not mention what to use as bait, so it took me some research to find what works best. It appears that many people find that peanut butter works best because it is sticky and cannot be easily carried away like a piece of cheese.I placed the traps on cardboard I cut away from a large cereal box.  This will make it easier to handle the disposal of the intruder.I was a bit worried that I will have trouble setting it up as due to a recent back surgery I can't put a lot strength into pushing on levels, but it was not hard. I had to push on the level until it caught a hook. The trap was fairly easy to set off, while I was moving it around to place in the right place it got set off. Luckiness I was not moving it with my hand.  Note that it got flipped and moved about 2 feet away from where it was before it triggered.Ali Julia review
B0002ZINDY This Snap-E Mousse Trap by Kness for $3.45 was set for a small yard rat (Woodrat I think) and it was sprung the next morning, but no rat.  I'll rebait and set again tonight or tomorrow and see what happens.  It sets easily and the Bait bowl is good for seeds or peanut butter.  Will hold up to rain and wet as it is plastic.  I will Modify my review if I feel it is required.  It's OK.
B0002ZINDY I had this very mousetrap in Logansport, IN for six years in a house rental and it served me well.  I was renting an old stone house by a wooded area with a field next door.  Not to mention, I'm lazy when it comes to mowing the lawn, so it often became a field mouse paradise especially late in the year.  I typically stop mowing in September waiting for winter.  That means the mice are gonna come my way to get out of the cold and go crumb hunting or carpet chewing in my house!I could hear the little sneaks in the evening when in bed. Knawing on the carpet edges, or some box they chewed into of my food. I wanted them out.  I noticed down in the half basement they liked the smell of salt near the top of the water softener.  I could tell by the dropings. I bought one of these mouse traps, and baited it with Andes mint chocolate. Mice appear to love the stuff.  I jamed it into the little hole and set the trap near the salt smell.  It wasn't a half hour later I got one, and scored three on the day!Over the next few years every time it got cold the mice would sneak in the house and I'd clean them out with the trap.  It usually managed to get them all, one year I got over 30.  A huge accomplishment for one little trap, at the time I've never bought a second.  The beauty of the thing is that it's easy to set using the second bar, and easy to release the dead critter.  A hungry cat lived nearby, so I would fling them over the fence by pulling on the second, no-touch mouse bar, and kitty would finish them off.I moved into a \"new\" (new to me anyway, built in 1955) house a little over a year ago in Fort Wayne, IN.  I noticed the past owner left out mouse poisons in several areas.  I couldn't have them around because my little dog Sandy would probably eat them if he found any. I searched the web for this type of mouse trap, and lucky found the same one I used nearly 15 years ago in Logansport. I bought two for me this time, and two for a friend, and it took only one day to clear out all five mice in my house.  My friend said his apartment was clean in just a few days.  I still baited with chocolate, he used cheese, but I think mice prefer the Andes mint chocolate bars better!
B0002ZINDY Its the old fashioned spring loaded - knock 'em dead trap.  Safer to handle compared to many others of this type and the most effective of the traps i used this very &#34;mousy&#34;  season
B0002ZINDY Great mouse traps. an upgrade to the wooden ones. My mice were licking the peanut butter off the wooden ones so i got these to try. the same night i caught one. These things will get them becaue they have to use there legs to trip the trap.
B0002ZINDY There really isn't all that much that I can add to whats already been said about these new fangled traps.  Let it just be said that they are best design and have the best function available if you are in the market or favor the old fashioned original traps we all grew up with.  I've been setting mouse traps for over 40 years and have never really gotten my finger smashed.  Yet I still shudder and am nervous every time I set one.  Everything in the old traps is there and exposed and you fully have to pull back the spring action to set it.  This trap utilizes a V shaped mechanism where the trap and spring handle are split and half, and only a fraction of the strength is needed to set it and get the same deadly tension.  You simply lift the handle that is standing straight up to release the victim in the end.  Also, this trap employs a small cup for bait as opposed to the inefficient little hook thingy that for too many of us I'm afraid, has only served as a buffet for many a mouse that managed to get the meal and make a successful escape. The little cup necessitates the mouse digging at the meal with the tension platform totally surrounding it.  I have never seen yet a mouse escape with the meal with this thing in charge.  This is it folks, the proverbial better mouse trap.  It's cheap, always available here on Amazon, (they are also carried but often are sold out at my local Lowe's) and most of all they do the job they are intended for just great.  My highest recommendation...
B0002ZINDY Of the newer snap traps, the Snap-E Mouse is the best built I've tried.  It's made to last awhile.  Unlike the traditional traps, the Snap-E makes disposal of the victim's corpse much easier; no touching the mouse and an extremely easy to operate release mechanism.  Definitely worth a little extra money.
B0002ZINDY I get no joy out of killing them, but the voles have driven me to this. Nothing has worked, not the castor oil, the bleach, the ammonia, the commercial pest deterrents,  or the dish detergent. This week I set up traps, some the old fashioned wooden types and one of these Snap-E traps.I've only caught one vole; it was with the Snap-E within hours of setting it. Set up is simple, no tricky bar to set. Filled the bait cylinder with peanut butter and pulled back the metal bar until it clicked into place. Removing the dead vole was easy too. Wearing gloves I lifted up the bar so the vole could drop to the ground. I buried it right there.It's an unpleasant business, but the Snap-E trap is efficient and effective.Update - I've caught two more voles with this same trap. Removing the vole is so much better with this trap than with the wooden one.
B0002ZINDY But not mine. It has managed to set off one of 3 I have set up, but it avoided getting caught, just as it has for 3 wooden d-Con traps. When I got these I was very optimistic because the bait is actually hidden and the mouse would have to investigate the smell and put its hand on the trap releases to get a better look at the food. Nothing seems to trick this mouse. I don't know what to do. It's been 2 weeks since I set up these traps.Does anyone have any food suggestions to bait with? I've tried peanut butter, walnuts and ranch dressing.
B0002ZINDY For years my family has relied upon the original old-fashioned wooden mousetraps to catch any mice that might be roaming around.  Recently, it seems that the mice are becoming smarter because they eat the cheese & peanut butter clean off the trap without setting them off. After this happened a few times, I decided to try to find a better mousetrap and came across this SNAP-E MOUSE TRAP.The trap works on exactly the same principles as the old wooden traps.  You place the bait in the middle of the trap and pull the spring back to set it.  The difference is that the trap has an incredibly strong spring.  Because of this, the trap is made of a sturdy plastic.These traps are incredible!  There's no chance of the vermin licking the trap clean because the trap is very sensitive.  Also, with the powerful spring on the trap, they are killed instantly.I have tried using other types of traps before, but these SNAP-E MOUSE TRAPS are by far the best mousetraps to catch & kill a mouse with.  Highly recommended.
B00062KQ42 Hey everyone,I bought this looking for a cheaper alternative to my Jobe's organic fertilizer hoping this would save me money. Sadly, I have yet to see any results from this. I applied it to herbs, veggies, etc and had no change in the plants at all.I decided to do a side-by-side comparison between the two. I'm comparing this product toJobe's Organic Vegetable & Tomato Granular Fertilizer 4-Pound Bag. Here is what I got.I'm testing this product with squash, all the squash has been started from seed.With Earthworm Castings;Pro: Holds more water, so less watering.Pro: Better price.Con: Little to no growth. It's been a few weeks now.WithJobe's Organic Vegetable & Tomato Granular Fertilizer 4-Pound Bag;Pro: Fast growth.Pro: More leaves, and has blooms.Pro: Seen results within a few days.Con: Price.Con: Don't hold water like castings.My suggestion so far: Mix them both together.If anything happens to change with this I will update my review. But right now the castings appear to help very little.
B00062KQ42 Used this with my plants this year and I really think the extra nutrients in it have helped them grow.
B00062KQ42 Just works for what it should.  It amends soil and is clean ie no bugs. Other than that I have not a lot else to say.
B00062KQ42 I use earthworm castings to feed my plants and to provide some free earthworms that seem to come with the product.  I guess there's eggs in the sack.  I also use castings to spread around the base of any plant that's having white fly trouble.  Seems the flies don't like castings and so they leave.  I add a few cup-fulls of castings to each potted plant too.
B00062KQ42 Most people have already said what needs to be said.Excellent product,good for TLO mixes,composting and top coating n teas.One more word,seriously.LMAO!
B00062KQ42 Bought this to use in the potting mix for my peppers and it works great.  Once you've got your plants potted use this stuff ever 3rd week with a rotation of CalMag and Fish Emulsion and your peppers will really love you and POP!
B00062KQ42 I have an old mallow bush that has had a white fly infestation every year beginning in the spring and running into November.  It is the only place in my yard where whiteflies have been a problem. Because the honey bees love the mallow flowers, I have not wanted to use a systemic or spray with harsh chemicals so the white flies have been right at home there for ten years or so.  In early March this year I placed about a half bag of earthworm castings on the ground under the mallow, spreading them several feet on all sides of the bush.  To my delight and surprise - no white flies on the mallow or surrounding area this year. They've moved away from my yard.  The honey bees are not at all turned off by the castings and continue to enjoy the flowers.  Now that I've seen how well they work, I will never again be without a supply of earthworm castings.  I can't believe I didn't know about their benefits earlier in my gardening adventures.
B00062KQ42 Real easy to work with and no stink. It mixes in quick and my plants are happy campers. Life is good.
B00062KQ42 I've used other brands of earthworm castings, but this is my favorite.  As soon as you open the bag you can see and smell that it is genuine worm-poop.  No, it doesn't stink, it just smells earthy and composty, but very identifiable.  My germination rates have increased tremendously, and better yet, the survival of my sprouts after germination as also increased.  Since using this additive to my germination mixes, my success in the greenhouse has really boosted my confidence.  I even started my own little worm farm, but they could never produce as much as I need, so I will definitely be purchasing more.My only complaint would be to the seller as far as shipping goes. (subtract 1 star) The bags are heavy.  I bought 4 of them with several other items.  They were tossed in one end of a long, narrow box, the other lighter items in the other end.  Guess how my box arrived?!  Duct-taped like crazy from the carrier (thankfully) because the heavy end of the box was totally ineffective for shipping heavy items.
B00062KQ42 _Depending on the plant you put these on/in, it'll do a fantastic job.  For what I grew, rumor was that I needed about five more products to aid in growth.  This turned out to be pretty much the only thing I needed (besides soil, of course).  A definite buy.
B00062KQ42 Nothing like worm poo to help fertilize the garden.  Worm poo is supposed to be spread at a rate of 1lb of poo for every 10 square feet.  So be mindful of how/where you need to use this stuff.  I purchase it for my raised garden beds.  It is one of the things that I use to refresh the garden at the beginning of the season.
B000667W4A A baby red squirrel...well....this is his dream buffet...attaching photos! I will attach 5 photos as proof...He's a cutie and he is very photogenic! I bought three of these. Scroll down to Customer photos the last 5 photos are mine... It's a very cute squirrel but to call this squirrel proof is totally FALSE!
B000667W4A I splurged on this double sided feeder, and placed it outside my den window so that I could watch both feeding stations.  This feeder replaced an older \"squirrel-proof\" feeder that had rusted away two years ago, and had been a sore disappointment in both the birds it attracted, and the squirrels who turned it into the neighborhood hangout.I've filled this with a good quality backyard bird blend, and have been THRILLED with the birds we've seen during the first week!  We've had the usual cardinals, blue jays, and sparrows, but for the first time, we've enjoyed chickadees and yellow finches.  It has been a true delight to watch during afternoon feeding time.For over 25 years I've maintained one or two feeders, and done very low-key suburban backyard birding, all in the same 1920's heavily-treed neighborhood.  I have to say that this is the most successful feeder I have put up yet in terms of the birds it has attracted, and the fact that no squirrels have yet made it their hang-out.  As far as the seed spilled on the ground, there's another group of birds that seem to find that attractive, so it isn't going to waste at all.The feeder comes with a perfectly adequate pole, as well as a hanging arm, your choice which to use in your yard.  The pole put it at window height in my yard.
B000667W4A We've been inundated by squirrels raiding (taking over) our platform birdfeeder that came with our country home.  After extensive searching and reading of consumer reviews, we decided on the Heritage Farms bird feeder.  It looked extremely durable and it holds a lot of seed.  The perches are weight adjustable so you can exclude blue jays or pigeons from eating the seed if you want.  I had the feeder set up in no time and it took about 1 hour before the first bird lighted on it and started eating.  Soon, the word was out and several birds were enjoying the seed.  We look forward to many years of enjoyment - it's built like a 50's metal toy truck, if you're old enough to remember!!
B000667W4A The squirrels quickly learned how to open the lid. One morning, I awoke to see a large grey squirrel scrunched up INSIDE the hopper, chomping away at the seed! I chased him away, took the feeder down, and made an insert of heavy 1/2\" hardware cloth. I opened the top and crammed the hardware cloth over the seed (I made it to come way up to the top but didn't fill the seed to the top, hoping to discourage the squirrels) and re-hung the feeder. That worked for 2-3 days, until the squirrels learned that once they opened the lid, they could push in the sides of my \"wire cage\" to get to the seeds. So there he was again, inside the hopper, wedged between my wire insert and the window. The squirrels later learned how to remove the insert! My idea didn't work. Secondly, this feeder is usually sold complete with the pole sections, the grounder and hardware for mounting, for the same price as this one. This is the feeder only.
B000667W4A We are looking for another feeder, so when I got to this page I thought I would tell you why this is the one we're going to purchase.We got our first `7536' feeder  over 10 years and we still like it.  For one thing it holds an entire grocery store size bag of sunflower seeds and for another  the birds love it.  Frequently both sides are filled with our feathered friends while there are others waiting in the tree for their turn.  [Thus our interest in another feeder.]Presently we have Chickadees, Nuthatches, Cardinals, House sparrows, Wrens, Gold finches, the occasional flicker and small woodpecker visiting.  When we lived it Texas it was convenient to exclude those pesky, though attractive, jays.Initially I think (okay--my memories a little faded after a decade!) it did keep the squirrels at bay, but that hasn't been the case for many years.  In fact, our local `free-range' squirrel has the glossiest coat you can imagine.  But we don't really care as he is so jealous of the feeder that he keeps other intruders away.The lapse in squirrel-proof-ness is probably due to years of collected grime and dust that clog the springs.  That and just the passage of time.Four Stars.  Our feeder is doing just fine after 10 years.  I think the other reviewer is wrong in saying that this feeder is available for less money.  I think what he has seen is the one sided version of this same feeder.  I say this because we have searched around a bit in order to save money.And about the squirrels--we saw a PBS special one time that showed what a gray squirrel would actually do for lunch.  They had these squirrels climbing, jumping, and riding in little wagons through a long tube to get to a bird feeder.  I concluded after watching those experiments that `proofing' was a ridiculous notion.  LOL.
B000667W4A This has been my best 'Squirrel Proof' Feeder to date and I now have six various kinds of feeders meant to keep out the 'grey hoards'.  When filled with mixed seed it also attracts the greatest variety of birds of any feeder I own, particularly Eastern Cardinals. Is VERY heavy when fully loaded and I found that hanging it is more secure than using the included pole. You MUST use a long and sturdy hanger to keep squirrels from hanging onto a branch or tree trunk and bypassing the weight triggered closing mechanism. Will keep out at least 90% of your Squirrels which usually content themselves to forage on seeds dropping to the ground below the feeder.
B0006856EQ This product is great to use along with Hydrofarm CK64060 Hot House with Heat Mat or just for 2-3 small to medium house plants that need extra grow light.
B0006856EQ I received this grow light stand with light within two days of ordering it.  Assembly took my husband ten minutes for stand and light fixture,  He's a carpenter so he can easily put things together.  \"This is easy, it just takes common sense!\" he commented.  For someone like me who needs step-by-step instructions though, it may have taken me a bit longer.  There are instructions for the light fixture assembly but he didn't even open those.He noted that the light fixture is slightly uneven on top (the hooks aren't evenly placed) but that is because an inch is needed for the electrical cord once the light is hanging from the stand.  So don't let the uneven hook mounts fool you.  Once the lamp is hanging there is very little wiggle room for the lamp to dangle.And what a bright light it is.  My little 10\"x20\" germination set almost seems too small!  Depending on how far away the light hangs from the seed box (the distance is easily adjusted with the white cord) this light could easily provide light for a seed box twice the size with regular rotations of the seed boxes.  After 12 hours ofnon-stop burning, the lamp did not get hot.The stand is sturdy.  But what amazes me is the brightness of the light.  Just one lamp in the dining room provided more light than a night light at night.  I may have to find a more inconspicuous place for this thing.All I have to see now is how long the provided lamp works.  This stand is a tad expensive but if it provided the medium to grow seedlings evenly, it's worth the price.
B0006856EQ I purchased one of these last year and used it this spring for tomato and pepper seedlings.  The ease of use and amount of light provided by this item was amazing compared to an old plant light I'd purchased many years ago.I just ordered a second one and will give my old light to a friend.Since I had a lot of seedlings, I draped a mylar sheet over the entire thing and it reflected the light wonderfully.I really like how easy it is to adjust the height.  My old light only has 3 static levels and you have to maneuver the entire light fixture on the arms from one setting to another.I've already purchased 4 bulbs and expect the two lights to serve me for many years to come.
B0006856EQ I replaced a very expensive growing system that uses proprietary bulbs and plant containers with this item, a few inexpensive clay pots and a shallow pan/tray to keep the pots in.  Live plants I've put under this light immediately start growing toward it and plants have much more room to spread out.  I'm just now trying to germinate some jalapenos so we'll see how that goes, but just for keeping fresh potted herbs from the grocery store alive indefinitely this thing is terrific.  A couple of transplants from the proprietary system (cilantro and mint) were struggling in their confined spaces but now are exploding.  I bought a live basil plant from the grocery and it is thriving (although parts of it are going to be sacrificed on top of a pizza tonight).My only complaint was that the power cord wouldn't connect tightly to the light fixture.  It kept falling out.  I didn't know whether the fixture or the cord was the problem and I didn't want to return the whole thing, so I went to Hydrofarm.com and sent a note via the \"contact us\" page describing my problem.  In a couple of days a very helpful guy named Nick wrote back and said he'd seen this before and a replacement cord had always fixed it, and could he send me one?  Long story short, the replacement cord he sent me did the trick.  Thanks, Nick!A minor thing to know: I put mine on a timer.  I have timers all over the place but realized that this requires a grounded (3-outlet) receptacle and none of my timers were 3-outs.  So I got the Intermatic TN311 for cheap here on Amazon and it does the trick.  No fancy stuff, you can't control it with your smartphone or otherwise do cool tech tricks with it to impress your friends and neighbors, but it is silent and it just works.
B0006856EQ This was a little difficult to put together for me with my disabilities. But I did it! I wish it had two lights. I tried to start seeds with it, but they do better in my Aero Garden . I'm hopingIt will be enough to keep my pepper and tomato plants going until spring. The replacement bulbs are not all the same, so be careful that you get at least what you got with it. I'm still trying to find some that are affordable and will do the job.
B0006856EQ I had always just used a regular lamp and a south facing window. And only had limited and some what pathetic results despite years of trying. I finally decided to stop messing around. Put this on my Amazon Wish List for Christmas and was happy to get it. Combined with a seedling heat mat under my seedlings I am seeing faster and healthier growth in all of the seeds I planted. Many of those only sprout in full sun, and I do not think any of them would have come up without this lamp. Very excited, and have just ordered another one!
B0006856EQ To address some things in other reviews:1) My Hydrofarm box was packed inside another box with padding materials, unlike others who've complained that theirs was not and thus arrived damaged.2) The frame was not warped, twisted, or otherwise misshapen.3) Mine does have the blinds-like pull string to adjust the height quickly and easily, no s-hooks in sight.Those points address
B0006856EQ This starting system is well built and perfect for starting your seedlings, the T5 light does a very nice job, I would even go as far to say it's a must have for your home growing!!!
B0006BFQJS I was somewhat skeptical that a lopper could handle a 3 inch branch - that's usually something that I would use a hand saw for. But this lopper actually comes through! It's the first lopper I've used with a ratcheting head which took me some time to get used to. You open the handles wide and the head snaps fully open. You then repeatedly open and close the handles and the jaws ratchets shut until the branch is cut. While this may seem to entail a bit more work, it's much easier on the arms and shoulders since you're cutting only a portion of the branch with every stroke. The head locks in the closed position for secure storage.The extendable handles work well, and have a click stop every few inches. No problems with the handles extending or retracting unexpectedly.The head is an anvil type head, so it's best used on dead wood since the anvil crushes the limb when cutting. Live wood is best cut with a bypass lopper so there's a clean edge.I use this mainly to chop up cut branches into manageable lengths. Makes quick work of the process. Good build quality - hoping for many years of use.
B0006BFQJS I've had these loppers for about a year now. They have a wide jaw and can ratchet through some fairly big limbs. However, they tend to bind, to jam in the open position, and the handles flex too much and can pull right off the blades, although they are easily reinserted.I do not regret the purchase, but these loppers need to be somewhat higher gauge. They are delicate for the force that you can apply.
B0006BFQJS This a very good tool and cuts very nicely. I agree that it does a nice job cutting, however, I give it 4 stars because the handles are a bit weak looking and flex easily when trying to cut live branches that approach 3 inches, and I am afraid I will snap the handle if I put too much pressure. That happens when the handles are fully extended or not...so 4 stars. With that said, it works as advertised. It can be locked closed. Be careful and it should get the job done relatively easily. I just wish the handles were sturdier.
B0006BFQJS If you clear any brush this is the tool of choice.  It will take off 3 inch branches with ease and the telescoping handles allow for a long overhead reach for limbing trees.  I couldn't get along without mine.
B0006BFQJS I only had to keep this for one day to realize that it had a manufacturing defect which may or may not be evident on others.The cutting blade only has a washer on one side.  When you try to cut something as large as 2&#34; the blade will bend to the sideand cut into the stop.  Bad deal.  I returned it for a friskas which I am happy with.
B0006G51KC The Perky Pet 203 CP is difficult to fill and clean since the only opening is the diameter of a soft drink bottle.  Perky Pet makes other models which open on both ends allowing you to clean and fill the glass jar though the larger end.  That means that you can use a soapy paper towel (rinse well afterwards with hot water to remove all traces of soap), to clean the bottle rather than having to purchase and use a narrow bottle washer brush.  This model also lacks and included hook for hanging.I have and far prefer the Perky PetPerky-Pet 130TF 8-Ounce Glass Top Fill Hummingbird Feederwhich has not of the above shortcomings and is a easy to fill and clean.  It comes with a small \"S-Hook\" for hanging, too.
B0006G51KC I'm generally satisfied with this purchase - I mean, the hummingbirds use it, so what's to complain about?  The actual materials and construction do feel a little chintzy, and after filling and flipping over for hanging, I always end up with a hand streaked with sugar water.  Acceptable, but nothing special.
B0006G51KC Works great, the humming bird loved it. I would recommend this to anyone, great product!Bees don't get caught in the feeder so it is wonderful
B0006G51KC We've seen Hummingbirds around our backyard, but never thought to put up a feeder.  While I was looking for something else, this feeder was displayed...The pros:+ Reasonably priced & free shipping was included.+ Small 8oz size, with a nice shape... easier to hold on to!+ Hardened glass+ Removable perch.+ Hanging wire is included.+ Small size = easier cleaning & fresher nectar.+ We haven't noticed any nectar dipping out of the feeder.The cons:- The attachment screw for the removable perch is steel, I upgraded ours to stainless steel.- The first feeder had to be returned, as one of the yellow bee guards was missing.  The Amazon return process was very easy & I had the replacement within 2 days.  Now that's customer service!&#9642; Our homemade nectar:To make a batch of homemade nectar, we add 1/4 cup of regular sugar to 1 cup of boiling water.  We use a 2 cup measuring cup, filtered tap water & 3 minutes in our microwave gets the water to a fast boil.  Pour in the 1/4 cup of sugar, stir & let it cool.  This is the exact amount needed to fill the 8oz feeder.  We decided not to color the nectar, as most say it's not necessary.&#9642; Our cleaning routine:The cleaning is very easy & should be done at each refilling.  While the freshly made nectar is cooling, we prewarm, then fill the glass bottle with boiling hot water & let it sit.  No need to scrubing the inside of the bottle.  Next we pull off the bee guards & set them in the sink to be cleaned by pouring boiling hot water on & thru them.  The last item to clean is the base & perch.  You guessed it, more boiling hot water is used to flush everything clean.  No need to pull anything apart, the boiling hot water will get to all the nooks & crannies.  Cleaning = piece-of-cake! :)&#9658; Notes:&#9642; It's easy to tell when the feeder is completely empty, as the Hummingbirds will move from one flower to the next testing each flower for nectar.&#9642; It disturbs the Hummingbirds to remove the feeder for refilling, so we do this now after dark.  When we did this during the day, one Hummingbird would come within a couple feet to investigate!&#9658; Update - April 8, 2013The Hummingbirds have started visiting our feeder, so I've upgraded our product rating to 5! :)&#9658; Update - April 28, 2013We have regular vistors now & it's a real treat to have the Hummingbirds frequent our feeder.  The formula we're using seems to be perfect, as the Hummingbirds love it!Not want wanting to be without a feeder, we decided to buy a spare one... just in case ours needs to be replaced.&#9658; Update - May 15, 2013When the \"spare\" feeder was delivered, we were surprised to see the bee guards had been redesigned.  Instead of the square shape, the bee guard is now rounded... a more realistic flower shape.  Today we installed those bee guards & right away we noticed the Hummingbirds spending less time probing & more time perched & feeding.  Yes, the improved shape is a winner in our book!&#9658; Update - November 24, 2013We never realized Hummingbirds stayed around our area this late in the year.  We don't get as many vistors, but they do come by, so we make sure the feeder is kept filled.&#9658; Update - November 29, 2013 - A problem & a solution!&#9642; It's getting cold now & there's a problem with the nectar freezing!  I had to use a hair dryer to melt the ice that had formed.  This worked, but I decided a better solution was needed.  I wired up a single red 7 watt, C7 incandescent indicator bulb (like a Christmas or nightlight bulb) & attached it to the glass (touching) with Velcro ties.  This keeps the nectar in the upper forties when the air temperature is below freezing.  I have a red bulb installed & the red light doesn't look bad at all, especially at night!  I'd post some picture, but this listing doesn't allow pictures to be posted. :(&#9642; We noticed that the Hummingbirds perch on the side that has the bulb, so we think they enjoy the heat given off by the bulb as they feed.&#9642; The temperature has dipped to 10F & there's no ice forming on lower part of the feeder.  The heat from the small 7 watt bulb can't keep the entire feeder ice free when the temperatures are too low.  We notice the Hummingbirds like to sit near the light to keep warm while sipping nectar.
B0006G51KC While I try to always keep plenty of flowering vines and plants around that are hummingbird favorites, I also make sure to keep nectar feeders available throughout the entire hummer season.  They always seem to show a preference for certain natural flowers; but there are many stretches of time when they're feeding solely from the feeders.Several years ago, someone suggested to me that I put out my hummingbird feeders earlier in the spring (early to mid-March here). The male hummingbirds arrive earlier than the females in order to find an ideal feeding and nesting spot.  This gives them a leg-up (wing-up?) on the other males in wooing the females when they finally arrive. Well, I did as suggested and it worked! For the past three years, we have ended up with a nest in our large crape myrtle tree at the end of the porch. It's been fun to watch as the babies begin to fly and drink at the feeder. Hummingbirds are devilish little things...quite territorial and aggressive (even with their siblings). Because of this territorial nature, I've had to hang an extra feeder to reduce the squabbles. Hummingbird habits may vary by region or type, but having the multiple feeding holes on each of the feeders has been unnecessary since they fight each other off and usually only one bird will feed at a time.I've been using this feeder in addition to theAspects 429 Hummzinger Highview Feeder.  While the Aspects model offers the advantage of slightly better visibility of the birds when feeding, this Perky-Pet Pinch Waist feeder has one difference that I find very beneficial.  Because it's important to not leave nectar in the feeders for more than 2-3 days during very hot weather due to spoilage and bacteria build-up, this model by Perky-Pet is considerably less wasteful of the nectar.  With the Aspects model, you must fill the feeder up to a fairly high level in order for the hummingbirds' beaks to reach down through the hole to access the nectar.  However, with this Pinch Waist style, I can pour just an inch or two into the bottle at a time (rather than filled nearly all the way to the top as seen in the product page photo).  When the bottle is inverted, even that small amount of nectar is immediately available for feeding.  As a result, I'm not having to regularly throw out and replace old nectar.  I just put in however much nectar they'll eat in 2-3 days time and then rinse the bottle with hot water and add more nectar.  It seems to be the  birds' favorite feeder, too, since it appears to receive much more hummer traffic than the other one.
B0006G51KC I have had several feeders that leak or the hummers don't like it including the Aspects 153 & 367 models.  I admit the Aspect model are easier to clean but if the birds don't care for it...  I live in Florida where hummers at my location are not large as in Texas and Cal.  So the size is better for refilling here.  Bees are not a problem here  and the yellow bee guards do not draw them to the feeder.  In fact, I cut small hole in the guards so the hummers could feed easier and also I liked the contrast of yellow because I could have taken them off completely. As for the color you could paint them with hobby shop paint or just nail polish.  Anyhow, I like it and the birds like it what else do you need.
B0006G51KC Took a while, but the humming birds finally found the feeder.  I'm hoping we're on next years rotation and they tell their friends.  I had no idea humming birds were attracted to red...
B0006G51KC To begin with, we have and use a very large number of feeders and have for years.  We have a very large number of different feeders which have been collected from here and there over the years.  We have been using this particular feeder in our arsenal for about six years now - as a matter of fact at present we have five or six of them in active use.Like most things we purchase and use in life, there are good things and bad things about this particular feeder.  Nothing is perfect and nothing is absolutely bad and useless.  Most hummingbird feeders fall into the middle and probably one of the biggest problems with this feeder and other feeder is simply expectations.  Some folks set the bar very, very high, while others more or less are willing to take the bad a long with the good.  We personally fall into this category.Now let's start with the positive:First and foremost, and I feel the most important, is that these feeders do attract hummingbirds and the little guys seem to like them. During peek season we actually have trouble keeping all of our feeders filled on a daily basis, ergo, we rotate the filling and cleaning session.Second, these feeders are extremely economical.  To maintain and use as many feeders as we have would be a major financial strain if we used only the high end feeders exclusively.  We have quite a number of these too, but hey there is only so much money in our household to devote to this one project.Third, the four perches provided are a welcome addition and I feel is one of the big attractions causing high usage.Forth, these feeders contain only 8 oz of nectar solution.  This \"forces\" me to continually check them and since we maintain so man feeders there is less likely hood of my getting \"lazy\" and not changing the unused (a rare occurrence) as often as I should.  There is less likelihood of cloudy and contaminated nectar.fifth, these are easy to hang in various locations and in winder they are quite easy to store and do not take up all that much storage space.Sixth, these are plastic and if you drop one, something that I frequently do, they will not shatter.  It is discouraging to drop a 20 or 30 dollar feeder and spend an hour making sure you get all the shatter glass cleaned up to say nothing of the loss of money.Now the bottom side:First, these are not \"forever\" feeders like most of the glass feeders we use.  They will over time, depending upon how much sun they get per day, deteriorate, become brittle and break.  We personally get from two to three years use out of each feeder but at that is an acceptable cost for us.Second, yes, these things are just a bit more of a pain to clean than some of our other feeders.  We do need to use special little brushes and to do the job right, they must be completely disassembled.  This is not a great burden though and truth be told, I kind of enjoy the process and it gives me a chance to check everything out to make sure all is well.Third, the bee guard is not 100 percent effective.  Small bees can and do get into the feeders and the guards are completely useless as to the ants we have here.  On the other hand I find that a coating of Vaseline to the wire holding the feeder pretty well stops the ant problem and since these things are being constantly cleaned and refilled the few bees that do get in, while unsightly, are not that great a problem.All in all, for us, the positives far outweigh the negative.  Is this the only feeder we use?  No, most certainly not.  I took a look the other day and we have about 10 different feeders in use at this time.  By the end of the summer we will have more when the birds become more active.  Is this be very, very best feeder we have?  No, but they price wise and effective wise they serve their purpose quite well.We are quite satisfied with this feeder and will continue using them as long as they are available.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks
B0006G51KC I hadn't put out a feeder for several years, but a little green hummer kept bopping over the the patio this past week whenever I was outside.  He'd hover and dart around the chimes and lights, making it obvious that he was looking for a feeder.So ... I ordered two of these because I wanted some that were small, affordable and had a bee guard.Thanks to Amazon, they arrived very fast and my little hummingbird has already found it.He's happy and I'm no longer feeling guilty.These are easy to fill and just the size I wanted.
B0006G51KC I used Perky Pet feeders for many years and was always satisfied, however they must have changed their quality control people because the ones they sell now are junk. If you just screw the bottle on to the base snugly, they leak, and if you try to tighten them they twist off and have to be discarded. The flowers and the wasp guards do not stay on after a couple of washings and have to be glued on.
B0006G51KC This is a good Hummingbird feeder, but once you start feeding Hummingbirds, this is way tosmall.Once the  Hummingbirds started coming to the feeder, I had to refill this at least 3 times aday.I then bought the BIG large feeder, and had to fill it everyday.Please do NOT buy the colored hummingbird food. The Red Dye is Unhealthy-poison to the Hummingbirds.The red yellow feeder and sugar attracts the hummingbirds not the red dye.Your can mix your own hummingbird food using :1 cup white sugar, too , 2 Cups hot, or warm water to melt the sugar.Stir very good till all the sugar is melted.. It should be a bit thick.Do not give it to the birds till it cools down.Do not be discouraged if it takes a few weeks before the hummingbirds find your feeder.I could only give this a 3 star for the small size.
B0006G51KC We really enjoy the free show right outside our kitchen windows where we have hung two hummingbird feeders. We have visitors from dawn to dusk, though they tend to go take a nap on really hot sunny days - perhaps the nectar gets too warm to suit them. It's so interesting to watch the different feeding strategies - some hummers hover and dive in for quick sips; others perch on the foot rest and guzzle. It is rare to see 2 or more birds at the feeder at the same time as depicted in the illustration, since they are quite territorial, but it does occasionally happen. The birds seem to have learned who refills the feeder. Several times when I've been in the backyard weeding or watering, a hummer will hover right in front of my face, maybe 2 feet away, and make eye contact. I'm sure he's saying \"hey lady, the feeding trough is empty!\" Sometimes they buzz right by my head when I'm sitting out there reading. As I said, they're always entertaining :)We have seen some bees on the yellow part of the flower, but not enough to be a nuisance. The major issue I have had with the feeder is the tendency to drip after you refill it. I always bring it indoors to clean it under hot running water, then refill with homemade nectar (4 parts water to 1 part sugar boiled briefly until the sugar dissolves). When I refill it in the kitchen sink and carry it outdoors I invariably dribble a little sugar water on the floor. Do you know how hard it is to clean up sticky sugar water from the floor? I should know by now that it would be better to refill it outdoors!Others have criticized the plastic parts, which won't last forever, but at the price, I don't mind having to replace it every few years. I had an all glass feeder a few years ago which was quite a pretty piece of art, but I gradually broke off all the flowers and perches, and it only lasted about a year...
B0006G51KC One was well packaged and the other not thus the plastic bird banches that stick out one was twisted off,  Both had different tops.  and unsure if they will even survive one season,  Was very disappointed in these,  They look nice but are very cheap
B0006G51KC I love this feeder.  I only have to fill it every three days as it is in the shade the majority of the day.  I've had mine well over a year with no sign of aging or even fading of the plastic parts.  The glass holder is sturdy and has not broken even though I've dropped it twice on my kitchen floor.  I am ordering another one today while on sale.  Glad would pay the full price for this, though!
B0006G51KC The pinch waist glass container holds just enough nectar to be consumed before it spoils.  Our delicate, tiny hummingbird guests enjoy being able to light on the little perches at each fake flower and drink without having to hover.  This is a simply-designed, low cost feeder that performs well and doesn't leak.  I don't see how a more expensive feeder could make our precious hummingbird guests any happier than this one does.
B0006G51KC Cleans easily and the hummers seem to like it.
B0006G51KC The body of this being glass is very nice so it will last in the hot sun and survive the dishwasher.  However, it makes it pretty heavy, so if you are using a window hanger, make sure its on there REALLY good.  The body comes unscrews from the top hanger easily, backing it a breeze to take down and refill.  Not sure 4 seats are necessary as hummingbirds don't like to share, but it doesn't effect its usage.  Wish the body was a little bigger to hold more as the birds go through it every 3 days, but that would probably make it too heavy.  Didn't influence my rating though.
B0006G51KC We have lots of hummers and every year I seem to need to add or replace a feeder. This design is definitely their favorite.
B0006G51KC Well, despite what Mr. One-Star Review says, we've used Perky Pet Hummingbird feeders for years (dare I say decades) and love them.  More importantly the Hummingbirds seem to like them.And do get the one with perches!  For regardless of what the sources tell you about the high energy levels of Hummers, when we've had feeders with and without perches, they use the latter more.  I mean, who doesn't like to rest for a spell.As to accessories:Skip the special food.  You can make your own 'nectar' by using 1-part regular sugar (not honey or brown sugar) to 4-parts tap water.  You boil the water briefly to drive off chlorine, then dissolve the sugar thoroughly.  (Don't boil too long, you'll mess up the 1-to-4 ratio.)  After the solution cools, you can then dye the sugar water red with regular household food dye.BUT do buy more bee guards.  They are cheap and should be replaced every season as apparently Hummingbird spit is pretty disgusting, and the guards will get a mold that might not be entirely cleansed away and might make the birds sick next season.Finally, do take one of the bee guards off.  We have a chickadee who has been coming for several years, who apparently has a sweet-beak.  It's funny to see him line up with the rest of our tiny friends.And whether you go low-end like this one, or high-end like some might steer you, make sure that you keep everything reasonable clean.  This is someone's kitchen afterall.Regards!Pam T~
B0006G51KC I purchased one of these feeders in the spring, along with one or two others of different design.  It didn't take long for this to win the popularity contest.  Before we knew it, this feeder was the object of pitched hummingbird battles, while the other feeders were virtually ignored.  We quickly picked up two more of the Perky Pet (what an awful name) feeders and now we have more hummers than we've had in years.  Around here, it's mainly Blackchin and Rufous, but perhaps some others will notice the crowd.The smaller capacity is an advantage.  There's less chance of solution going bad, and the glass is easy to clean.  We're finding that the feeders need to be replenished about every two days, so there's little chance of gumming up.  A little pricier than some feeders to be sure, but the birds sure like them.
B0006G51KC A few weeks ago we helped my mother clean her garage and came across two of these feeders, both brand new and in their original boxes. Mom did not want them, so we gave one to a neighbor and brought the other one home.Nothing happened for the first few days... we were initially a bit disappointed. Then, after two more days we noticed that the fluid level dropped a bit. Following directions, we emptied and cleaned the feeder at week's end and then refilled it -- and that is when the nectar carnage really started!  As week #2 of our feeder experience got underway, the feeder emptied in about four days and we began to see hummingbirds coming and going at all times of the day.Guess the word got out!Now, in the middle of the fourth week the feeder is emptying every 2.5 days or so.  We have wonderfully colored green, yellow, blue and kinda magenta hummingbirds flying around in singles and in pairs, and they are awesome to watch. They love this feeder, flying in to land on a perch and sipping until content, then buzzing right off.Highly recommended!  Totally fascinating.
B0006G51KC Often sold in garden stores, but the price here was better. It's outside all winter (down to 25 degrees) and has held up well.
B0006G51KC Our hummingbirds show up every spring, hover at the window until I put the feeder out. They seem to like this kind for some reason. I have had other types and they ignore them. Whatever works ! The hummingbirds have voted.
B0006G51KC We've had this feeder for a year and have had good success attracting hummingbirds with it. The bright red color apparently does a good job luring them to our window. It's a little inconvenient to clean but I don't mind because my wife does it.We have it hanging on a hanging device attached to a deck rail in front of a window. The only problem with this set up is that I can barely see the hummingbirds who invariable decide to perch on the opposite side of the feeder.Watching the hummingbirds is a joy. It might be a good idea to add a water baffle to the top to discourage ants. It really works.
B0006G51KC The old glass Perky Pet nectar feeder that still have is from the late 1980's or early 1990's.Hope this new &#34;Perky Pet Glass Nectar Feeder&#34; will last as long as that old feeder is lasting!With the construction being very similar i think it might. Differences being:new style has perches & new style has a threaded top & plastic cap where the old style did not have perches & it has a rubber cap & a grove in the top of bottle for a wire to hold the cap onto the bottle.The bee guards on the new feeder really do keep the bees out.If Looking for a glass nectar feeder that the hummers would like;this one by Perky Pet would be an excellent choice!
B0006G51KC MY ORIGINAL REVIEW WAS 3 STARS.  I STATED THAT IT WAS CHEAPLY MADE BUT FAIR FOR THE PRICE.  WITHOUT SOLICITATION FROM ME, THE COMPANY WROTE ME AND FOLLOWED UP.  PRETTY AMAZING AS MY ORIGINAL REVIEW WAS 3 STARS, NOT TOO BAD.  BUT I REALLY APPRECIATE A COMPANY WHO WORKS THIS HARD TO MAKE SURE THE CUSTOMER IS SATISFIED WITH THEIR PRODUCT. HAVE BEEN USING THE FEEDER FOR SEVERAL MONTHS NOW AND IT WORKS FINE.
B0006G51KC Buzz, my Anna's male hummer who has claimed my yard and this feederas his own, seems to like this feeder.  I have two now, I rotate them each weekas I clean, refresh them.  They are a bit hard to clean, I use a toothbrush to cleanthe feeder part.  The newer one is a bit different than the one I got a couple years ago,the perches don't seem as good, seem a bit short, but, it works so far.  Price is rightanyway, especially if you only have one or two hummers that use it.
B0006G51KC I have several hummer feeders and about half of them are this one, which I consider one of the best.  My only admonition is to clean it regularly and systematically, lest it become fouled with algae and other crud.  Of course, this is something we hummer aficionados should do any way, right?
B0006G51KC I have 2 of theses and I get lots of hummers! You must keep them ant free and clean and the hummers will come for food! Be sure to change the food often, especially if they are in the sun.
B0006G51KC I have another style of feeder, as well, but this one is the birds' favorite.  I've found that having a couple of smaller feeders also works better than one big one.  You waste less nectar.
B0006G51MA Purchased 4 of these feeders and one of them leaked profusly right away. Sent it back and Amazon replaced it with another one that also leaked. Since then, the other three started leaking also. Don't know if I can still return the entire batch since it has been a couple of months, but I am going to try. I had these same feeders in the past and they lasted several years. Somebody \"improved\" them.Update: I contacted the manufacturer direct since the Amazon return policy is only good for 30 days and they replaced all four feeders with no hassel whatsoever. Havn't received them yet, so I don't know how these will perform.
B0006G51MA The hummingbirds recognize this feeder right away (better than the saucer kind) but it started leaking after a couple months.  Pretty unreliable.
B0006G51MA There is something about feeding hummingbirds that creates an almost Zen like feeling.  Watching them as the fly around and feed multiple times a day.  They are actually quite friendly and many will fly within a foot of you or less and listen to you talk to them.We have had this feeder for several years and it is the best one we have owned.  It is easy to clean up with the large hardened glass bottle and the hummingbirds like the perches to sit on.  We like how the bottle screws into the base and then you can flip it and hang it.  I even have a photo of a hummingbird, a monarch butterfly and a honey bee drinking at the same time.In the summer time the humming birds can drink up the sugar water like crazy.  Now if I could only get them to stop fighting over it.  They all think that they own it and they sit there all day long and guard it like it is their personal lunch line.Feeding hummingbirds is fun and enjoyable.  This is the best feeder we have owned out of about 5 styles.  Try it and you will like it!
B0006G51MA The only reason I gave this feeder two stars instead of only one is that I like the glass bottle, much nicer than plastic.  Even at that, the glass is hard to clean unless you have an overpriced feeder \"mop\" or a flexible bottle brush.Despite the advantage of glass over plastic, this feeder is not even useable.  I hung it in the shade but it still leaks like crazy.  It leaks when the wind blows.  It leaks when the temperature rises.  It leaks just because it feels like leaking.  And that attracts ants, armies of tiny, biting ants.  I've tried filling it to almost the top and I've tried putting just a bit of food in it - doesn't matter, it leaks.Even if that weren't a problem, I still would not like this feeder.  The plastic bottom and the flowers inserted into it are next to impossible to clean.  The flowers have little ridges that cry out to be filled with mold and nasties.  A dirty hummingbird feeder is worse than none at all.  I think the manufacturer is doing the birds a real disservice by selling something that is likely to end up with dirt and mold, and be bad for the birds.So, this product is for the birds.  And very much NOT for the birds, not if you care about them.
B0006G51MA I swapped out my old plastic hummingbird feeders for this glass one because the plastic ones kept getting moldy and were so hard to clean properly. This one is the perfect size to hold 2 cups of homemade sugar syrup, which the birds love. It took a good few days to a week before the birds would use this feeder. I don't think they like the perches, as they loved my old feeders which didn't have perches. They don't seem to feed for as long on this feeder as my old feeders either. I also think they preferred my old feeders because they had the raised yellow flowers, this feeder has flat flowers which doesn't seem to attract them as much.
B0006G51MA I received this feeder from Woodstream (Parent of Perky Pet brand) as a replacement for the wildly poorly designed 120TF model. Although it had a tiny initial leak, which took a while to detect, it was easily fixed and has been serving well since.After filling the unit for the first time with home brewed sugar water (1 part sugar to four parts water), I found that the birds seemed to be able to down a cup of liquid in no time at all. The tiny leak on the bottom of the unit showed itself after my wife and I noticed that one of the hummingbirds was feeding off of the BOTTOM of the feeder, licking the bottom inside of the rim. An inspection of the area below the feeder showed a building crowd of ants feeding on the occasional drips. At the next refill, I took care to find the lead site using water during the cleaning (*** Note, I follow the instructions to avoid soap and detergent and use hot water. My experience is that hot tap water works great if you wash the unit twice a week as I do ***). After carefully drying the base, I used some liquid model airplane cement to penetrate the crack where the leak was coming from. Althernately, I could have used silicon rubber sealer, but my thought was that the glue would penetrate and seal the crack better while the sealer would leave a channel for the sugar water to be trapped in and breed bacteria. Also, the glue dries way faster and I had impatient customers hovering in my yard :-)This quick fix did the job and the 210P retains all of its food for the birds. In our case, the three birds that frequent our yard in the SF Bay area drink about a cup every 3 days. So, I do not fill the whole reservoir (16 oz or two cups) since the instructions, and most online commentaries, say to change the food out every 3 days or so to reduce bacteria growth and keep the birds healthy. BTW, if you leave your leak on the bottom un-repaired, it is also better to have less fluid in the tank because it will put less pressure on the leak and reduce the loss.Finally, if you really don't feel like you want to repair a new feeder, Woodstream customer service seems to be quite responsive. A quick call and they will send you a new unit. Happy Hummer-watching!
B0006G51YS My hummers had no trouble switching from the basic bottle feeders to this saucer, and I love it because it's the oh-so-easy to clean.  The built in ant moat dries out rather quickly, but I basically fail to fill it anyway, and haven't had any ant problems at all.  I now have 2 of these feeders, that hang from shepherds hooks, and there's no leakage problems whatsoever.  Remember:  change your sugar water frequently; every few days, to avoid spoilage.  I highly recommend this feeder.EDIT (04/2008):  I wish this feeder came in 8oz, since I don't really need 16oz, and don't get that many hummers (unfortunately).  But, I did also purchase a Hummzinger Fancy (12 oz), and surprisingly I just didn't like it.  It was easy to clean, but was deeper than the PPO, which didn't appeal to me.  I had put the Perky Pet on one hook on the south side of the house, and the HummZinger on the north side's hook.  The HummZinger didn't get much activity, which was surprising since the hummers are used to both hooks having a feeder.  After 2 weeks, I put the HummZinger away and went back to 2 PP's.  Activity resumed on the north hook...Considering both feeders are outside from April to November, and rinsed in hot water for every cleaning, they've held up well.  No cracking, minimal color fading, no flowers have needed replacement to date.
B0006G51YS This feeder is very easy to clean and to fill.  Lots of feeding stations.  There are perches all around, and the hummingbirds appreciate this.  Since there is no container above the feeding stations, you can see the birds from all angles, a big plus.  This would be a 5 star product if the design was modified a bit.  If the feeder was a bit smaller in circumference and a little deeper, it could still hold 16 ounces of nectar with slower evaporation and a little more stability when hanging.  This is a good, functional feeder that's reasonably priced.
B0006G51YS This thing is great! If I remember, I'll upload some pics. Totally easy to clean. the clear bottom and red top separate and its just a big space to easily wipe out - no nooks or crannies to worry about. Everything seems pretty solid and sturdy, and it is a bit bigger than I thought it'd be, which is not a bad thing. The only negative is that the brass hook is too small to fit on my standard iron shepherd's hook - I think someone else mentioned this too. No big problem though - I am just using one of those big plant s-hooks for now, and later I'll get a smaller one (so it doesn't hang quite so low). Other than that easily fixed issue, it's great! Bought this to replace a standard 'Best 1' feeder.
B0006G51YS At this time in 2008 our yards were a haven for over 12 hummers so it off to the Amazon hummer store.  We bought 2 new ones including the Pet 221.  My first reaction was this will be just perfect for them because they can sit while eating and even thought the construction is somewhat shoddy it would work well for the birds.  The little area to collect ants is well placed.So now comes spring and hummers we were excited to watch them and their new eating holes.  We made no changes to the formula or any other item except the feeder itself.  No hummers.  Well, almost no hummers.  A ruby red buzzed us several times at each location but would not feed.  One day while putting one of last years feeders one actually sat on the feeder while I was emptying it into the plants.  He fed and told me he did not like the new ones.  Well, not really.  But why would one hummer feed from the old and not from the new.  Right now it is time to retire the new feeders and revert to the old.  It is possible that the new has an odor in the plastic that the hummers do not like.  I do not know.  For now this has been a waste of money.
B0006G51YS Well, Iike the feeder, easy to clean and hang, but the birds really like it much better than my more traditional one that's like an upside down jar and that's what matters, they like it. I think I'll get another, but I like the traditional one as it's hanging in a window, but still, the birds like this one better.
B0006HGP7O This feeder is HEAVY. That translates to sturdy. No more little squrriel teeth mangling up the finish and function. Three small feeding slots are located on the front of the feeder. the perch, where the birds sit themselves to dinner, is spring operated. It stays open until something heavier than a bird grabs it. This would be the squrriels. the perch pivots downward, closing the feeding slots. The spring is adjustable, so depending on the size of the squrriels in your neighborhood, it can  be adjusted to thwart the little furball from raiding the seed bin. However, they may be able to hang from the roof of the feeder and reach some tasty morsels, but not a lot of seeds are accessible from the top through the slots. We use a variety of seeds, including sunflower seeds, and haven't found one that won't go through the slot from the supply bin.this is all metal, except for the windows, which are mounted into the feeder walls and serve as supply indicators. the top opens with the twist of the windvane. This is where you fill the feeder. It is a twisting affair to close and open the feeder, I don't see how squrriels have the strength to open it, so that will end the pop-the-top burglars. It has a heavy handle to hang it with, or there's the pole/base mount that comes with it if you want to place it on the top of a pole. It's built to last.
B0006HGP7O When filled this is a very heavy bird feeder so be prepared with a steel hook on a post. I doubt that your going to be able to tree limb mount this due to its weight combined with the narrow space between the roof finial and the underside of the handle. But it is a lovely, well constructed, metal bird feeder with a weight sensitive perch. The squirrels can still eat anything that falls on the ground but between the slippery metal and that perch they won't be stealing from inside. And the lid comes off easily while still being able to fill and secure. The bright red color means you can easily spot it outside. This holds a couple pounds of bird seed.
B0006HGP7O I've been working my way up to a large permanent bird feeder over the last couple years. We get some really beautiful birds (Cardinals, Blue Jays, and a yellow crested bird that I don't know) and I love seeing them in the yard. But these feeders I've gotten at the local stores don't hold up. They weather poorly and break or look terrible after they fade in the sun. Which is exactly why I love this one!This is a huge bird feeder, made almost entirely of metal, with a metal roof that helps water pour off it easily. This isn't going to break. And since the top is silver it wont fade there either. Overall, the construction of this feeder is great. Even the part that closes if a squirrel steps on it is metal!How does it work? The ledge that the birds perch on closes down and covers the food openings if too much weight is applied. This works great as birds wont push it down but squirrels will.It has the hanger you see in the picture and also a place in the bottom for a post (it goes up in to the house about 4-5 inches, so is solid). The post looks to be about 1-1.5 inches think and fit on the end of my shovel.Top quality! Highly recommended.
B0006HGP7O An extremely well constructed feeder, easy for owner to fill, but so far impossible for squirrels to get to the seed. Owing in part I'm sure because of the squirrels ability to get into (either opening or chewing through) other feeders they are very large and do not tolerate well inability to get to the seed they want. The solid steel construction and effective protection of clear plastic windows have made this one of only three feeders on our property the squirrels and/or raccoons have not been able to break into. The simple, wide opening (but securely fastening) access on the top of the feeder make it extremely easy to fill the cavernous feeder. My 91 year old Father-in-law spends a great deal of time at his dining room table reading and looking out his rear window at this feeder and he loves watching the squirrels trying unsuccessfully to get into the feeder! Strongly recommend this feeder for anyone plagued by squirrels raiding their bird feeders. christina & bogie
B0006HGP7O I received this very large box via UPS and couldn't imagine what was inside. Unlike most things today that ship in parts in order to spend less in shipping but, consequently, may not be built as well in the end.  While the main photo shows the front, the sides are equally as big and it's nothing short of adorable.These are not cheesy plastic parts that will weather and crack. This is made of sturdy metal and the roof of the house is like a metal barn roof with a galvanized steel look.The weathervane is also metal and cut but polished with no sharp edges, just as a large one would be.The perch is made so that if birds sit on it it stays open, but anything heavier, like a squirrel, will close the opening.You have a door and windows to further taunt said squirrel to get to see the buffet closed for business until he can starve himself down to bird weight...aww, such torture, Mr Squirrel!The metal bar that holds the feeder is tough and meant to stay in place on a branch without ever breaking away.Truly a well made and adorable piece, sure to delight all the birds that can line up on the perch and feed together, and sure to torture unlimited squirrels......fortunately for them, I also have a squirrel feeder.  Werd.
B0006HGP7O This is an attractive high-capacity bird feeder in the style of \"The Tank\" as commonly known at the Audubon Society shop.  It functions by closing access to the feeder when the squirrel puts its weight on the bar.  Birds which are much lighter in weight than squirrels will not lower the bar and can feed happily and freely.Overall a much more affordable alternative to The Tank, the capacity of this bird feeder is 12-lbs and depending on how hungry/greedy the birds are in your area, the seed can last up to a week or more before needing to be refilled.  This is perfect for skittish birds that tend to avoid areas with a lot of human contact.This feeder is also available in red and a green whereas the Tank was only available in green.The only caution/con is that a strong sturdy branch is needed to hang this from.  Also this bird feeder needs to hung high enough so that squirrels will not be able to stand up and feed from the feeder by bypassing the weight trigger that closes access to the feeder.Overall highly recommended.
B0006HGP7O I have two of these feeders.  I have had one up for about a year now (We feed birds year around) and the one being reviewed here has been up for approximately 2 months now.  These two feeders are in addition to nine other feeders we have about the place.  We live on five acres which we have turned in to a bit of a bird sanctuary.  It is heavily wooded for the most part with a small orchard and garden on one side.  We also have a very, very large squirrel, raccoon and possum population.  While it is extremely difficult to count squirrels, I would estimate that we have at least 35 hanging about the place.  I like squirrels for the most part but they are a pain and it costs a lot of money to keep them fat and happy.  With our large number of oak trees, hickory and orchard fruit (in season) the little tree rats do quite well for themselves.First, these feeders are quite easy to mount.  I have them both mounted on small tree stumps I have had to cut that were too near the house.  They are relatively easy to keep filled.  They are designed to discourage squirrels and so far both have been quite effective.  I have had no mechanical problems with them so far.  There are a couple of things to note and remember when using this particular feeder.  First; keep in CLEAN!  Each and every birdfeeder you own and use should be thoroughly cleaned frequently...very frequently.  These feeders are NOT water proof and the seeds in them will get wet and if you do not keep the wet seeds out they will gather mold and mildew.  Not only can this be deadly for the birds, it will eventually cause the spring mechanism to malfunction...the gunk will build up.  Maintaining bird feeders properly is a lot of work!Secondly, if you have raccoons, be assured that a determined raccoon and absolutely destroy one of these feeders in very little time!  They can and will dismantle it.  Hey, a raccoon can dismantle a Sherman tank of there is food involved so a feeder...no feeder, stands a chance if they set their little minds to it.Third, birds can be and are rather sloppy at times.  The spill seeds.  Due to the designed of this feeder, this wasted is at a minimum but still and all there is some spillage present which ends up on the ground and thereby attracting squirrels and other critters to the general area.  Not much you can do about this.Forth, it took out birds a little over two weeks to get use to this particular feeder.  It was slow in attracting birds at first but once they \"caught on\" both feeders are as popular as the others we use.  Do keep in mind that birds react differently in different parts of the country, a fact we have noted after living in a great many parts of the United States.  This review involves country birds living in the Missouri Ozarks.  For all I know east and west coast birds may hate the thing....you just never know about such things until you give them a try.Fifth, when you clean your feeder, use just a very, very, very small amount of 3 in 1 oil on the movable parts.  By doing this I have been able to avoid and mechanical problems.This feeder, while possibly just a bit pricy, is very attractive and a pleasure to view.  We have been very satisfied with both of our feeders.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks
B0006HGP7O I have owned this type (not brand) of feeder for decades, and it is the single-most effective way of enticing a variety of birds while discouraging squirrels.  The perch bar is counterweighted so that anything heavy will pull it down and close the access to the seeds.  It's a simple, brilliant design.  This Perky Pet version is a good implementation and improvement upon the original design.The Perky Pet has one major improvement over the last feeder like this that I owned:  metal perches.  Frustrated squirrels gnawed through the wooden perch on my last feeder, and I kept having to replace them with wooden dowels.  I also like that there are two perching spots in front of the seeds, one for smaller birds like goldfinches and one a little farther away for larger songbirds such as cardinals.  On the left side of the perch, there's a weight adjustment lever to set the sensitivity of the closing mechanism.  I wish Perky Pets had provided a quick set guide to show which setting was the most/least sensitive so I didn't have use trial-and-error.  The most sensitive setting will close the door when too many small birds or some large birds, such as jays or grackles, land on the perch.  The galvanized metal roof is not as attractive as a painted version, but the rest of the feeder looks nice.The top of the feeder opens by twisting the cardinal weathervane on top about a quarter turn.  The center part of the roof lifts up.  I really dislike how difficult it is to align the latch and close it.  Especially on a cold, windy day, I don't want to be struggling with finding the inside hole while my fingers are going numb.  Otherwise, the construction is first-rate, with squirrel-proof metal and an inaccessible (for squirrels) plastic windows.  (Anyone who has owned a feeder with a plastic feeder with an exposed edge knows how quickly squirrels can chew right through it.)  Because I have mine mounted on a tree, the deer can empty it if they put some effort into it.  The squirrels cannot.I also own the Perky PetSquirrel-Be-Gone Wild Bird Feeder, and that works well, although birds such as cardinals that prefer hoppers or trays often stay away.  Plus, this one has a much sturdier construction.  If you are only going to get one feeder for your yard, I recommend this one.--  Debbie Lee Wesselmann
B0006HGP7O Update 5/15/14:I do like the look of this feeder, but after using it for a while, there are issues.  The biggest issue is that rain gets inside the feeder from the top (where the cardinal is).  The food ends up wet, clumps, and molds.  I've started putting in a very small amount of food and tilting/shaking the food forward toward the opening.  Also, the locking mechanism (turn cardinal to lock lid) has become very difficult.  It is hard to get it to catch properly so the lid remains lose.  Maybe if you live in a very dry climate you wouldn't have a problem - but with Florida's afternoon rains, this is not the best choice.Original review:I was pleasantly surprised by this bird feeder!  First, it is very nice looking and larger than I expected.  The \"weather vane\" turns to unlock the roof.  Lift off the roof, add bird seed, then reattach lid.  Easy!!!  The weight triggered perch closes off the food if squirrels or large birds get on the perch.  There are 4 positions to vary how easily the perch lowers and closes the food supply.  Nice looking, easy to use - I'm definitely happy with this feeder.
B0006HGP7O There are many things you notice right off on this feeder.  It is all metal, very attractive and built very well.I am impressed!!I loaded it up with bird seed and within 2 days the birds adjusted to it and actively feeding.  As you can see by the picture there are clever designed \"windows\" so you can easily see the amount of remaining seed.Included is the heavy hangar and again clever designed mounting system with screws so you have options on how and where you place it.  I do have it mounted under cover, but it appears to be water proof with its tin roof and painted body. I wouldn't hesitate to put it out in the rain.This would make a great gift for yourself or for someone else.
B0006HGP7O The Squirrel Be Gone birdfeeder is undeniably attractive.  Painted fire engine red, it is shaped like a barn, with a tray that is meant to just bear the weight of birds, nothing heavier while they access the feed from small openings, with a metal handle that fits in the side holes for hanging and a little weathervane piece on top, which by twisting you can open the removable roof part and fill the feeder with seed.Mine, however, was shipped without any kind of instructions in the box, although I was careful to make sure I didn't throw anything resembling them away by accident.  I received it in several pieces: four bolt parts, the barn part, a red base-looking part (which I assumed was meant to provide some kind of \"anchor\"), plus the handle which attached to the sides.  Feeling vaguely like a preschooler with a Fisher Price toy, I untwisted the weathervane handle and tried to bolt the big red base piece onto the bottom with the screws using the appropriate screwdriver. They kept falling out, regardless of how much I tried to tighten them, although the smaller \"anchor\" part stayed on without bolts.  The next step was to figure out where the bolts did go.  Unfortunately, repeated examination of the holes did not yield the answer.  Two holes on either side were meant to attach the silver handle, which I did without trouble. So far, I can put the feeder out on a flat surface or table, so the birds can enjoy the feed, but I doubt that that's going to keep out the squirrels.Overall, the feeder does look like it would be successful to foil most squirrels, but I can't really grade it on that. So I'll give it three stars, and hope that other reviewers are much more helpful.  I don't know whether it was the lack of instructions, some glitch in the specific feeder I got, or my own incompetence that's responsible for this experience, so I'll just wish anyone who does purchase the feeder luck.
B0006HGP7O I received this bird feeder and I was really impressed with how sturdy it is made.  It will be very effective at keeping squirrels and field mice from hoarding my stash of bird seed.  It should last many seasons.  I really love the baked-on red enamel and the nice tin roof.  I am well pleased.
B0006HGP7O Although I have come to the conclusion that where a product is made is no important to me (it is made in China), I am giving this bird-feeder four stars because it is well-made and very attractive. It looks just like a barn on my daughter's farm. It is red, has a weathervane on top, windows and a metal roof. It is supposed to be a deterrent for squirrels who sit on the bar because they weigh too much. Our backyard squirrels hang upside down on the post and get into anything, but so far they  have not been attracted to this feeder. I have the old feeder up in the backyard and the birds loved it. It is just blue and clear plastic- we stopped putting birdseed in it when the new Perky-Pet Country House feeder arrived. It has been up for six-days and today is the first day that I was able to observe a sparrow actually eating seeds from it.  Apparently, the birds are taking their sweet time in adjusting to their new source of bird food.  We feed our squirrels peanuts I buy by the sack and because we gave a resident feral cat who is blind and old, we also get a possum and very big raccoon coming to our back-door to eat cat food and drink fresh water. This bird-feeder is an attractive addition to our small back yard and I trust that in time our usual back yard birds (Cardinals, Finches, etc.)  will return. The Mourning Doves eat the seed that falls to the ground and since there hasn't been that much activity at the new red feeder, they too aren't visiting us too frequently. I am giving them all time to adjust to their new food source.Well, here is an update: after using this bird house for approximately two months, it has broken. The metal rod that holds the rooster on top (this secures the top of the opening where seeds are poured into) has vanished. This morning I found the roof of the birdhouse on the ground and cannot find the rest of the pieces anywhere. Perhaps an outraged squirrel or large bird came along and broke it to get at the seeds inside. I now would recommend that you do not buy this bird feeder unless you just want it for decoration.
B0006HGP7O I can't complain about the squirrels because I put out peanuts and corn for them so I am inviting them into the yard. But they seem content to eat corn and peanuts. They don't bother my other feeders. They are like little monkeys in the yard. I like to watch the squirrels. However this feeder still seemed like a good idea.I have had it up for a few weeks. I have black oil sunflower seeds in it. The birds hit it regularly.It looks great and seems quite durable. I have mine hung from a garden hook.
B0006HGP7O I love this feeder.  It is a little bit bigger than I expected, but I absolutely love it.  I especially like the weathervane on the roof, which is also the latch that opens and closes the top.  The opening to fill the feeder is quite large so it is very easy to fill and the feeding area is great for handling the peanuts and sunflower seeds I put in and hasn't jammed or anything like that.  An interesting feature is being able to control the bar that is meant to keep squirrels out; I haven't figured out what adjustments I need to make, but it is a neat feature. Overall, I am very happy with my feeder and I am looking forward to getting a lot of bird traffic in my backyard with it.
B0006HGP7O I love my wild animals, especially birds!  I have several bird feeders and love to attract as many birds and variety of birds as possible.  My one or two problems are squirrels and big black birds.  I was thrilled to see this adorable Perky-Pet Squirrel-Be-Gone Bird Feeder. It is just so cute...just like a little red barn with a weather vane on top.  It is also very well constructed.  It is working great at keeping the squirrels out of the bird feed.  My squirrels can empty a feeder in just a little bit, but not this one.  I love watching them try and try to get food out of it.  I don't want to hurt the squirrels as my husband suggested using a BB Gun on them so I am just so happy that they will not be harmed, but also can't clean out the feeders.  5 stars!
B0006HGP7O This feeder will most certainly light up any back or front yard, it is THAT pretty.  The paint is a solid and thick laquer, and I like the metal perching bar instead of wooden dowels which can get chewed away by annoyed squirrels over time.  The feeder has a large solid hanger and also comes with pole mount.The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is the filling access.  This feeder top loads, and in order to open the roof piece one must turn the squirrel weather vane.  Opening the roof is easy, but closing it again requires some finesse and delicate realigning of the inside lock.  One needs to be able to look inside to get it realigned, so mounting the feeder on a high pole as we like to do is out of the question.  If the company can figure out an easier way to lock the roof this will be a solid five star feeder.
B0006HGP7O As is often common for me, I've ordered something and didn't read the size of the item and it is waaaay bigger than I expected. I thought this would be the size of most average bird feeders (softballish size), but it's about 3x that size (basketball size). I realize I'm comparing a square shape to round with that, but I couldn't think of anything else of similar size that everyone might understand...So, other than my shock at the size, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality workmanship on this bird feeder.It is made of metal, with the only plastic piece I can see being an adapter you can put on the bottom if you want to be able to mount it to the top of a pole (but it also has the heavy gauge wire you can hang it from that you see in the picture.Another reviewer commented that blackbirds can sit on it without activating the drop-down that blocks the seed (which is how it prevents squirrels from getting the seed, a heavier critter, when it steps on the perch area, causes it to drop down and close off the access to the seeds.) However, there is an adjuster setting on the left side that allows you to change the spring tension making it more sensitive or less sensitive to weight. I've found it to be fairly sensitive and not a problem. HOWEVER, the one thing I do worry about is the way the mechanism closes off the seed access - I'm worried that a critter could have it's beak or toes in the seed area before the metal part drops down and the critter might be hurt or get something caught when it drops down. This is probably pretty unlikely, but it was something I noticed none-the-less.As mentioned in other reviews, the feeder does not come with instructions, but I found the use to be pretty intuitive. The little mini-weather vane on top of the house locks and unlocks the access for filling the feeder (when unlocked you then lift the panel from the top that the weather-vane is connected to and a large area is opened to use for filling).I agree with the other posters who say that the red color attracts the birds so they quickly check it out and find the seed.All in all this is a great feeder, I do wish it was a bit smaller, but that's my own problem as I should have read the dimensions rather than assuming it would be the size it 'looked' in the picture.
B0006HGP7O I wanted to replace an old bird feeder that was similar in style to the Perky-Pet Country Style Squirrel-Be-Gone.  Because both are weight activated, I falsely assumed the spring-action mechanism and construction of the Perky Pet would also be similar, but I was sadly mistaken.We discovered upon arrival that there are no directions.  In our case, inserting the metal handle into the feeder wasn't much of a challenge (our older model hooks in the same way).  Those who have never owned this type feeder might be scratching their heads wondering how everything connects.  Perky-Pet could easily avert assembly frustration by including a few instructions.Our older model is constructed of heavy gauge metal.  The hinged roof opens up entirely for easy seed re-filling and shuts back up tightly.  The Perky-Pet is made out of lighter metal with lots of sharp edges.  The weathervane cut-out, although cute, is a badly designed seed-filling port.  It just doesn't open up or shut very well, and seed filling is cumbersome.  Crafty squirrels use the weathervane as a good grasping point and toe-hold.  They easily outwit the feeder and help themselves to seed (see customer image).  I figure it's only a matter of time before they learn how to open up the weathervane port too.  Only a portion of the roof comes off, and it leaves a gap between the stationary roof and cut-out weathervane.  I have had this feeder only during snowy winter months, but I wonder about water seepage into the seed chamber when spring rains finally arrive.The weight activated perch bar is controlled by an adjustable spring, something akin to paper clip strength.  No matter which setting I use, it mysteriously moves to a different setting.  Living in a woodsy area, I don't know which animal to blame for that, but our old feeder had much sturdier spring settings that stayed in place.  We never encountered this problem.To its merit, the Perky-Pet does feed birds and if the spring stays in place, it also keeps out bigger pesky birds.  Maybe in your neck of the woods it will even keep out squirrels, but as my picture attests, it sure doesn't around here.UPDATE:  Just as suspected, the squirrels finally figured out how to open up the weathervane (customer photo). Now they make a daily raid.  Not many birds even use this feeder so I'm taking it down for good.  Perky-Pet should omit \"Be Gone\" from this feeder's name and simply call it \"Squirrel Country House.\"
B0006HGP7O I've had this feeder up for over a month and have observed the following:It's heavy, very heavy; too heavy for a shepards hook so I placed it in my apple tree. It's also big and holds a lot of seed. I have the red model. It's pretty, very attractive and looks great.It's not squirrel-proof but is squirrel resistant. Since the feeder is in a tree, squirrels are able to jump on top of it. They hang upside down on it and slobber all over the feed ports while trying to get the seed out. They don't get a lot of seed but they make a mess while trying and at the same time annoy the birds.Several times during the night an animal, I am guessing a raccoon, was able to remove the feeder from the hook, throw it on the ground, and then try to rip the top off, slighting bending the sheet metal. To the feeder's credit, most of the seed did remain inside although the critter was able to slightly bend the metal up a bit on one side. I've added a piece of duct tape to the side that has the gap. [Update: I found the feeder on the ground a few more times so I added a small baffle on the hook above the feeder. This appears to have solved the problem. The critter has not been able to remove the feeder from the hook. 7/2013]The weather vane knob that opens and closes the top fill area doesn't lock securely. It could be improved if the manufacturer adding a grommet to give it some tension. It pops open very easily and several times I've found it undone. It's also difficult to get it back on after filling.The spring tension adjustment hook on the perching bar is ineffective. When a critter jumps on it, the hook pops out and there is no longer any tension and large birds will not be able to eat.The inside of the feeder has sharp edges so it will be a little challenging to clean inside. The outside ports are already getting gummed up for a rainy week and squirrels licking it, but the outside cleans up easily.The feeder is water tight. After a rainy week the seed inside remained dry.Birds like the feeder. The first birds to appear were the House Sparrows and Cowbirds. The shy birds like Cardinals and Goldfinch waited a few weeks to make it was safe, but now all the usual feeder birds are eating from it. I tried various seeds and even a mix. I get the best results from black oiled sunflower seeds.I have owned many different types of bird feeders and all have their faults. The only way to make one squirrel-proof is to put it on a pole with a baffle where squirrels can't reach. This feeder is a decent compromise for someone who wants to hang a pretty feeder in their tree. A plastic, light weight feeder would be eaten and shredded in days. This one should last for years.UPDATE: Sept 1, 2013Not chipmunk proof. For the past week the little critters have been climbing the tree, dropping down over the roof of the feeder, sitting on the top of the bar and filling their pouches. By sitting on the top they are not heavy enough to close the deterrent bar even on the lightest setting. I added a squirrel cone to the hook above the feeder but they are still able to climb over it. Once the chipmunks go into hibernation at the end of October this problem should go away. The birds still enjoy the feeder and it really does prevent most squirrels from gaining access.
B0006HGP7O The Perky-Pet 338 Squirrel Be Gone II Country House is cute.But it's flimsier than it looks from the photos. The construction is thin sheet metal, with sharp edges.I don't know why there are so many positive reviews. It's a less effective feeder than cheaper options (i.e., the birds don't like it -- at least our birds in the midatlantic), and my squirrels have been able to get out the seed. Meanwhile, the seed has a tendency to get stuck with the awkward portals and under the levers.The feeder can be hung from the metal hanger (which is shown in the photos), or it has a large shaft through the middle, so you can stick it on a pole.The weathervane also serves as the latch to open the top, but it's also poorly engineered.
B0006HGP7O Squirrels seem to give up very quickly on this feeder, as their weight closes off access to the feeder tray.  While that is a great, money-saving aspect of the feeder, and I really like the large size (fewer refills) and level-check windows, the downside of this type of feeder is that it limits visits from beautiful larger birds (woodpeckers, cardinals, blue jays, etc.  Finches, sparrows, and wrens seems to only visitors due to the small landing area it offers.
B0006HGP7O It is nicely constructed. It is made of metal, so it will hold up. The perch is weight triggered so larger animals like squirrels will lower the perch and block the food. You can also adjust it dependent on the size of the birds in the area. You can adjust it for larger or smaller birds. It is larger than I expected and will hold plenty of food. If you twist the Weathervane, it will unlock the the panel on the top for easy access for refilling. It also comes with an attachment (including fasteners) that you can place on a stand and you can place the feeder on the stand, easy to place and remove from stand. Over all this is a nice feeder.
B0006HGP7O I must say, I was thrilled to be able to get this through The Vine!! These types of feeders are SO expensive (but really, they're worth the price because they work!). Thirteen years ago, when we bought the home we live in, there was a similar type of feeder (adjustable, spring level) squirrel proof feeder mounted on top of a pole in our back yard. I was excited because I'd never owned one and wanted to see first hand how (and if!) they worked. I was super pleased with the results! Still have that feeder, same place...and it's going strong!! I must say, that the older one is heavier duty than this one (no clue on the brand, but there are some out there that are more expensive than this one from The Vine); but this one still does the job! I love that it holds so much bird food. We feed black oil seeds exclusively and they work great in this feeder. The lever/bar shuts when the grey squirrels attempt to get to the food:)~ we have little red squirrels that use the feeders and I don't mind them at all ~ they are not hogs and they don't make a mess;) ~ they can still get the seed because they are very light in weight.This feeder, as I mentioned, is not as heavy duty as some you will find on the market, but again, does the job equally as well. There are adjustable levels (spring activated type), so you can decide which you want to try out. I always keep it at the lightest possible level because all the birds (but no grey squirrels) can use it without an issue ~ even bluejays. It comes with a heavy duty (attached) handle as you can see in the picture, but it also has a mounting bracket so you can put it on a post. The weathervane twists to come off. That is where the seed goes.Highly recommend this feeder so far!
B0006HGP7O It's cute, no doubt about that. The photo shown here is not exactly what the product looks like though. The \"weather vane\" serves as a handle for removing part of the roof in order to fill it.  The weather vane has to be turned about a quarter turn or less to \"unlock\" it, allowing you to lift part of the roof away.It's biggest flaw is the sharp metal on the roof.  The photo doesn't show how they cut out a square area of the roof that you lift to fill the feeder. The edges of this square metal piece that lifts off are rather sharp. They tried to dull the edges some, but the metal is relatively thin, which makes it relatively easy to cut yourself. Very poor design, and unfortunate. The outer edges of the roof itself are the same way.Durable metal, but the roof should have had more safety built in, such as rolled edges. Also, it's not as easy to clean as the \"tube\" type birdfeeders.
B0006HGP7O This feeder is quite large, and holds up to 12 lbs. of bird seed. It may be more feeder than you need, unless you have a huge number of birds visiting your yard. The size can make it hard to find a good place to hang it, unless you have a shepherd's crook. It also comes with the hardware required to attach it to a post rather than hanging it.I've hung mine very low on my rhododendron bush so my ground-feeding birds will feel comfortable using it. Even with it so close to the ground, there seems to be no pilferage from squirrels or other furry creatures. Just don't hang it so low that the squirrels can eat from it without stepping on the bar. Their weight on the bar is what causes the feeding ports to be blocked.The feeder is quite sturdy, made of metal except the windows, which are plastic. On my feeder, the bar that sits across the front for the birds to perch on does not sit straight across. It slants down to the right, which makes the whole feeder look slightly lopsided. It's not a big deal, and the birds don't care, but if you prefer symmetry, it could start to bother you after awhile.
B0006HGP7O Perky Pet's feeder is big, beautiful, and bright, a beacon for our birds who found it within an hour after it was hung. It was disconcerting that the feeder came with no paperwork, but I did figure out how to fill it with seed, and how to adjust the tension. The weather vane twists off for filling, but it is a little tricky to line up for reinstallation. Fortunately the feeder holds so much seed that it won't need to be filled often.The fit and finish of the feeder is very good; I've found no paint blemishes or defects. My one complaint is that I wish the weight sensitive perch that closes when squirrels stand on it was a bit more sensitive. A large blackbirds can alight on the perch at one time and devour quite a bit of seed; I've noticed that two blackbirds in the perch at once can close the door to the seed. We have another squirrel proof feeder in the yard that seems to be more sensitive and closes access to the food more readily when large birds try to gorge themselves.Bottom line - This is an attractive feeder that our squirrels haven't figured out YET.
B0006HGP7O This is a good sized feeder and it looks good in the yard.  It seems to be a favorite for the smaller birds.  I've had it in the yard for a couple of weeks now and the squirrels have so far ignored it.  Be careful when you are handling this feeder because the edges on it are very very sharp so use care when taking it out of the box.Updated review several months later:  The feeder has been out in the yard for several months now and it still looks good.  However, the squirrels have now discovered that can climb onto the top of the feeder, unscrew the latch, push it off and then they climb inside and have a picnic.  So I will have to come up with a way to make it so that they cannot unscrew the latch.
B0006IXXEG I put them pout. I saw a few birds pecking at it.The price is good. it looks, texture wise like good suet to me.
B0006IXXEG These work very well, the only problem now is that one only lasts 2 days at the most so I limit to how many I put out, usually 1 a week along with other bird feed too
B0006IXXEG Time to re-order, the birds seem to love it, so do the squirrels.  One will last about 4-5 days unless a raccoon comes along, they'll eat the whole thing at one time.  I've wired the suet cage shut so they can't open it but they'll sure put a big dent in it.  I like to give back to nature since we've taken so much from all the wild animals.
B0006IXXEG Song birds really enjoy this..woodpeckers not so much
B0006IXXEG I bought this case of suet cakes for my new suet holder.  I was trying to attract more birds to our yard in our new house.  The birds (mostly the woodpeckers) have really enjoyed these suet cakes.  It is a great price for the case of 12.  I am pleasantly surprised and pleased with how much of a success these suet cakes have been.  I will definitely be purchasing more in the future.
B0006IXXEG Like this one, I use them both and mix outside for the birds, Much cheaper this way then one by one at the stores.Love it, well, the birds love it...
B0006IXXF0 I have found less expensive and higher quality products at stores nearby. The birds don't seem to like it and I will be looking elsewhere for my next carton of suet.
B0006IXXF0 Glad to have discovered these...Heath Outdoor Products DD5-12 Suet Peanut Cake, Case of 12...just started building a Bird Sanctuary and am learning about different types of bird food....and feeders....These are great so easy t just peel them open and drop in the feeder.
B0006IXXF0 I've stayed away from suet for quite a few years because what I've seen in feed and pet stores are small cakes that would be fairly messy to handle. When I finally bit the bullet and ordered the Heath Suet Peanut Cake, I didn't expect much. However, they are well packed, fill the suet cage fully, and reasonably priced for the case of 12.It took two days before the Chestnut-backed Chickadees found it. Then word got around and we had Oak Titmice, Black-eyed Juncos, Bewick's and House Wrens, House Finches, House Sparrows, Scrub Jays, and our ever-plotting squirrel (Sydney) come to the feeder two to three times a day.I put the suet at the end of a relatively flexible branch in our tangelo tree. That stymied Sydney; he just couldn't hang on, so now s/he waits on the ground for whatever scraps may fall. And the positioning is a good way to control the Scrub Jay. They're a little too heavy to get a good footing (\"beaking?\") on the feeder and lose balance, but not until they've taken a tiny chuck of suet. That's where Sydney comes in again.Anyway, we've never had so many chickadees and finches and wrens before. Heath's Suet certainly seems to please the palates of locals.
B0006IXXF0 These suet cakes are great for those that have a bird feeder with the square holders on them.  All types of bird love these, including cardinals, blue jays, wrens and others.  They also last for a while as week..usually a week for us as they have lots of visitors eating them.
B0006IXXF0 The birds really seem to love this flavor - I've tried others, but they prefer this one.Regular visitors to this suet include Blue Jays, Downy Woodpeckers, Hairy Woodpeckers, Red-Bellied Woodpeckers, Flickers, Titmice, Chickadees, Nuthatches, Carolina Wrens, and even a Baltimore Oriole!I use this suet in tray feeders, hanging feeders, and I cut the squares into 4 pieces to use in the log feeders (it's much cheaper than buying suet \"rods\" for the log feeders.)Highly recommended.
B0006JO0X8 I have had this unit for seven months, now.  It honestly is just a cheap device, turned out cheaply, to cash in on the solar craze now going on.  I'm all for great-quality solar panels that provide reliable energy.  This unit does not.  Yes, it reads fine on my multimeter, when I check it, but the battery on my RV is not staying charged.  I have gone through two charge controllers, so I have to think that the panel just might be the culprit, here.  I am in a city with almost 90% very sunny days.  This panel gets full, blazing sun, just about daily, for seven hours.  You get what you pay for, and you don't get much, apparently, at the price this unit goes for.  My RV battery performs as it should when it is not hooked up to this unit.  It charges and holds charge when I'm on the road.  Again, it looks like a case of a badly made solar panel.  Spend more for a better unit.
B0006JO0X8 Sunforce 50032 15 Watt Solar Battery Charger -  I have installed it on my Boat to keep my electronics deep cell batteries charged.  Trolling motor batteries mostly.  Works well.  Pricy, but what is that money for anyway.
B0006JO0X8 I purchased 6 of these for a backup system for my home. Two Northern units and 4 Sunforce units all 15 watt. ( these are the exact same units btw, northern's are cheaper). With two inverters, a 2500 watt, and a 300 watt pure sinewave for computers and such. Hooked through a 7 amp charge controller to a pair of 110 amp hour deep cells in parallel for a total of 220 amp hr's.I first hooked two panels up to see how they did, they worked well in very low light but couldn't ever get the batteries to \"full\" on the controller. I then hooked up a third panel and that gave enough to bring the batteries to full after a full day. With six panels hooked up, it will bring the batteries to \"full\" in a very few hours from a 30% drained condition.These units are less then optimally placed and rarely get full sun, but do very well even without that. Two panels in full sun may very well have been able to bring the batteries to \"full\" but location is a problem for me. One other product of note is the P3 international \"Kill A Watt\" electrical useage meter. Doing a survey of electrical useage in my house to get ready for this project was an eye opener to say the least.Great panels, at a good price, that do what you pay for...all you can ask for.
B0006JO0X8 I bought this, then bought the set of 4 that comes with extras. Works like it says but for the money your better off buying the set.
B0006JO0X8 It comes with a nice long cord which was long enough to reach from the corner of the room of my RV down the refrigerator vent where I connected it to my 7 am charge controller and ran a wire underneath to the battery.  This cord has a plug on the end to connect to one of several connectors included. (No wire splicing necessary).  It comes with connectors for connecting to a cigarette lighter, alligator clips for connecting directly to battery posts, as well as a connector that just splits off two wires with the insulation already removed for you in case you need to wire them directly into something, or extend them with more wire.  It also includes a LED test light that can plug directly into the solar panels cord to test whether the panel is working.I have attached two of these solar panels to the roof of my RV camper.  They keep the battery fully charged even with the propane detector still using electricity.  I was able to screw the panel directly into my rubber roof with the screws provided with no problem.  They are very secure and they were a great investment.
B0006JO0X8 This is a sturdy, well built solar panel which is great to keep batteries topped up. They are only 15w each so don't expect a lot of power but they are small and easy to install. I have 4.
B0006JO0X8 Puts out 24 v in Sept PA sun @ 15 w power. With voltage regulator and deep cycling storage battery with or without inverter will keep your house/ shed/ workshop low amp tools and lights running from sundown to bedtime. I have cut my electric bill $10 per month with this unit so in two years it will have paid for itself including all accessories. Great panel, great shipping.
B0006JO0XI As a few others have posted, in here, the quality control on this Chinese unit is poor.  The wiring on my unit was reversed.  Once I set things right, the unit worked correctly for about four months before complete failure.  My battery died in the bargain, due to the unit failure that allowed my battery to drain completely with no load on it except this unit and the solar panel.  I'll try one more and then update this review.  Update:  I just ordered: KINTREX SPC0601 Solar Charge Controller - 7Amp, 100 Watt,...  At just $10, on this site, it's a far better deal and has an extra indicator light for low charge condition.  The connectors should mate up perfectly if the pictures are accurate. As far as the reversed wiring goes, in all electrical applications with connectors, an exposed contact is normally the ground, coming from a power source.  The hot side is recessed and/or shielded to keep you from grabbing it and then a grounded object or contact, which would result in a shock.  This scheme is reversed, obviously, in the non-powered side of the circuit, ie., the thing you're sending the power to that mates with the connection just described.  When I called Sunforce's rep, in Canada, and spoke with him, he denied knowledge of any other incidents of reversed wiring.  That's really curious, as others have posted about the reversals, as I mentioned, above. UPDATE: 4/2011- The Kintrex unit works flawlessly.  You are well-advised to go with it and leave the reviewed unit, as above, alone.  It costs much more and is inferior.
B0006JO0XI Sunforce 7 Amp Charge Controller - I installed this on my boat to charge one battery for my electronic fishfinder and chartplotter.  It is still working and keeps the battery charged well.
B0006JO0XI I do understand electronics and how these things work. For my curiosity I purchased one of these and opened it to verify the design. From my observations I found that it is a very basic 'Linear' charge controller design to prevent Lead Acid batteries from getting overcharged & severely undercharged. Nothing more nothing less.It does work as advertised and your costly lead acid batteries do not get 'boiled' from prolonged charging in strong sunlight as the circuit merely shuts off power flowing to the battery once it reaches the cut off preset of +14.2 vDC. It then waits there illuminating the 'Green LED' till the battery voltage drops to below 13v and the cycle repeats. It does not have enough brains to 'trickle' charge at a 'float' charge level after the initial bulk absorption phase has completed. Therefore lead acid batteries that have SOC more than 80% Especially the ones that do not have any phantom loads and do not get used that often may not get fully charged with this basic design. In reality you are actually losing ton of Solar Power going nowhere using this basic ON/OFF switch sort of design.It however does have beefier QTY 3 Blocking diodes in ''parallel'' on the + VE bus line to have lower forward resistance? when the charge controller delivers power to the battery. This seems like a good idea for delivering whatever the solar panel has to offer to the connected battery minimizing loss, But as they are not thermally coupled I do have some concerns about thermal rundowns on one of the diodes in extreme situations. That explains why certain people have had their controllers blow up for no reason. - Makes sense?On the plus side, When these work, These Blocking diodes prevents any current from flowing back into the solar panel at night and does not drain the battery when left alone unused. This also prevents any damage from back-feeding voltages getting into the solar panel itself thereby protecting it from accidental abuse of reverse polarity. This also explains why the charge controller works only when there is Sunlight falling on the panel as it uses 'Solar' input voltage to illuminate the LEDs. You cannot view the state of charge (SOC) of your 12v Battery even if it is fully charged - until a partial sun shines on the solar panel! to activate the circuit.Bottom-line: For the price you pay you do get a 'basic' charge controller that may suffice certain installations that are rated to use 100w or less Solar panel capacity & for batteries with need for low amps for charging but for real utilization of your precious Solar energy and storing them into your Lead acid batteries you need to invest little bit more and get a 3 stage Maximum power point tracking (MPPT) Solar charge controllers.Three stars! from me. Thanks for reading my review!
B0006JO0XI I have two 20 watt solar panels connected to this controller, along with eight 7Ah 12V sealed batteries on the output side. I've had absolutely no problems for the last three years...the batteries charge up during the day and feed my yard lights for a few hours each evening.  It's worked reliably as annual temperatures cycled from near freezing to 105+ degrees.
B0006JO0XI Functions just as advertised-please see my other reviews to see what you can use it for. Much better than jury-rigging an old auto voltage regulator as it automatically protects from overcharge or overload. A car regulator will fry unless its an old fashioned electro-mechanical and that would be less efficient than this product. Great item!
B0006MTRJ2 I was looking for a short hose to put between a faucet and the control center for my irrigation system (connectors, timers) so I can place the connectors on a stand which is easier for me to reach. Photo of my set up attached under customer photos.Turns out it is difficult to find a short water hose.  Even though I don't need a water hose rated for drinking water this hose was the right length and I got it. Overall it works fine: the length is good and it handles my high water pressure fine. However, the connector to the faucet is plastic and even with a brand new washer and Teflon tape I have a small leak.  Nothing major but you can see in the photo that the mulch under that connection is dark - it is always a bit wet. I don't have any other connections that leaks so I know how to make good connections with the aid of Teflon tape. The long hose with a metal connector that was used on this faucet before did not leak, so the problem is with this particular plastic connector.This hose is not totally perfect, but it has been at work for a few weeks 
B0006MTRJ2 I bought this so that my dehumidifier could drain directly into the sink instead of collecting in the basin.  It connected easily and has not leaked yet.  The length was perfect for my application.  Seems like it will last a long time.
B0006MTRJ2 Said to be drinking safe, this cute little 4 ft hose is perfect for me as a split-off from the main faucet where I have the big hose. On a hot day I like to drink the really cold well water which comes out after garden-watering. The connections are tight. I always put a bit of Vaseline on washers at the beginning of the season, OR replace them with new rubber ones. I do this on sprayers as well. Maybe that's why I had no leakage problems.
B0006MTRJ2 I must have six or eight of these small hoses.  I always find a use for them!  When they are on sale, I purchase several to keep them on hand.
B0006MTRJ2 These work for the purpose I bought them, but what a pain to have to run to the store and buy washers for them.  I bought five of them.
B0006MTRJ2 This is a good quality water hose that is safe to drink from.I keep a bowl of water outside my workshop door so the dogs can drink whilst they are out with me. I was always wary that water sat in the regular garden hose could have leeched chemicals, and I would be tainting the water of my four legged friends. I now use this hose instead.  Piece of mind, for just a few bucks.Some reviewers appear to have been shipped hoses without the rubber washer. If you dont use a washer, then it will leak. Mine came with the washer and does not leak. The washers wear out over time and need replacing, I keep these on hand:Gilmour 01RW Rubber Hose Washers
B0006MTRJ2 I have a spout in my garage that sits about two feet off the floor. So I needed a short length hose to use for filling up buckets, watering can, etc. This fit the bill perfectly. Install was a breeze and it is well made, so it should last for a long time. The only draw back for me was that the hose is way to stiff. It sits in a curled up position and always retains back to that position no matter what I try to do to remedy it. Overall not a deal breaker for me as it has exceeded my expectations.
B0006OIZN4 I positioned the fly trapper next to my double doors leading to the deck.  I am surprised how many insects it traps -- I didn't know so many were visiting.  I like it because, of course, it works but also there is no odor to deal with and changing glue boards is a snap.  The boards are cheap enough to keep it relatively clean all the time.  A good investment.
B0006OIZN4 Must be working because I Am seeing fewer micro-flies flying across My screen. I lost the glue trap so put some Black Flag fly paper next to It. But I really want an Electric fly swatter that runs 24/7 on house AC Its a joy to the ears to hear that popping.
B0006OIZN4 My first reaction to this product is that it is very expensive for a single unit. But if it works better than the others, perhaps it is worth it. I bought 2 units and plugged them into different locations in the house. After two weeks of testing, they have only caught 2 mosquitoes and 1 small unidentified bug. I have seen fruit flies cruise right past them and there is still a pesky fly buzzing around my house who seems to have no interest in the traps.In addition, the UV light is rather cheaply and flimsily inserted into it's holder so it moves around and causes a loud buzzing noise which requires you to readjust the light from time to time. The buzzing noise is loud, you will hear it if you are in the same room. Finally, this unit is missing an on/off switch so the ony way to turn it off is to unplug it from the wall and find a place to put it which is ackward because of the sticky tape which slides out very easily and the fragility of the UV tube and the fact that it is not terribly secure in the socket.I realize a good trap is hard to come by and none of them are perfect, it could be that this unit is one of the better ones on the market but at $34 a pop, it just doesn't strike me as good value for money. At this time, I cannot recommend it.I'm debating if I should give Flowtron a try, the only thing holding me back is that it is not designed for indoor use which is what I require.
B0006OIZN4 Bought two of these to try to deal with mosquitos that sneak into the house.  Have caught quite a few small flies and gnats, too.  Ordered an extra pack of glue strips.  Be careful to slide the strip in properly and it will be catching flying pests right away.Nice that these are for inside use but an on/off switch would be a good addition.  To turn off, you have to take out of wall socket.  Since the light is pretty bright, I only put them on at night when we leave the rooms or if we are going to be gone for most of the day.A variation that might also work would be a model that could be plugged in but then attached higher up on a wall where the glare of the light would not be in human sight all the time.  Like the large units you see in commercial buildings but scaled down for residential use.
B0006OIZN4 I would rate this product at 5 stars easily based on how well it works. I give it 4 stars because I opened the package and realized there was only one glue card in the box. I did not think this was a big deal until the next morning I realized how well it worked and the glue card was full! I had to order some more glue cards and I am still amazed at how fast they fill up. Many different types of flies and even mosquitos get stuck on this thing. It works great!_Bottom Line_  I would recommend this product and suggest buying more glue cards ahead of time because this light actually works and the cards will need to be changed often!
B0006OIZN4 This Fly Web Fly Trap is actually much larger than expected and did work somewhat to help control my fruit fly infestation. We tried three products side by out of desperation and here are the results after 48 hours:Terro 2500 Fruit Fly Trap; used as directed, caught 2 fruit fliesFly Web Fly Trap; large plug in light based trap with sticky pads, caught 11 fruit fliesFly Paper Strips, Fly Catcher Trap, Victor Fly Bait 4 Pack; the old standby, not attractive but effective, caught at least 32 (perhaps more)The Fly Web product performed right in the middle of the other two products we tried, but no telling how many it would have caught if it was the only product we used at that time. It also only comes with one sticky pad (which turned out not be an issue since the card was far from full), but refills are availableFly Web Glue Board 10 Pack.We are sticking (mild pun intended) with the Fly Paper Strips going forward.CFH
B0006OIZN4 I have tried and tried to fild a product that would get rid of those pesky knats!! and fruit flies around the house, and I must say I HIGHLY recommend this product, and is the only thing that has worked well thus far. I keep this running day and night and you would not believe the amount of knats and fruit flies this thing catches!! You better buy more sticky pads, because this thing will sure get filled up quickly. This product receives an easy 5 star rating form me.
B0006OIZN4 We live in the country with horses on our property and cows on our neighbors. We have large fly traps (Stinger 80 Watt - 1.5 Acre traps) setup away from the house to attract and kill flying pests. I bought one of these to deal with the pests that inevitably make it inside the house.We are house training a puppy, this involves long periods of time when doors are left open, and hence a lot of flies getting in the house.When I set up this unit I counted 12 flies in the kitchen. Sadly, half of these remained the following day. It did catch some flies, but doesn't seem to attract them as one might hope. I tried placing the unit in various places, and ensured the only light on at night was the one from the trap.It will catch some flies, but it is not going to catch them all. I'm sat watching a fly just 6 feet away from the light who is happily wandering around the counter top with little interest in the light at all, even though the light it the brightest thing in the kitchen right now.Another point to consider when choosing this unit over an electric one:The sticky pad surface is illuminated by the light, meaning all the catch is displayed like a gruesome killing field; in comparison to electric killers that typically have the insects fall in to the bottom of the unit. The electric method comes at the expense of that annoying arcing sound as the insects get zapped, this unit is silent.
B0006OIZN4 Some seasons, I get a lot of small flying insects in the house, mainly because I like to operate my whole house fan.  The main offenders are gnats and small mosquitos that get through the bug screen on my windows.  This unit is great because no matter how small, these bugs will stick to the glue strip.  I bought a spare bulb and spare glue sheets jsut to have them on hand.My only wish is that the unit would add a power switch.  I only operate it at night (makes a good night light in the hallway!) and must physically unplug it and set it down to turn it off.  Either that or a darkness-sensing switch.
B0006OIZO8 This is the replacement glue boards for the absolutely awesomeFly Web Fly TrapThese glue boards are very sticky with a small strip on the edge where there is no glue. Easily slides in/out of the Fly Web Fly Trap. These glue boards get so packed with flying and even crawling critters that the card is hardly white! Inexpensive yet very effective when used with the light. Once they are on the glue board they are stuck, period._Bottom Line_ Yes, I would recommend this with the Fly Web Fly Trap to let the glue board and light do the work for you! Easily throw away the critters instead of wiping up splats!
B0006OIZO8 These Fly Web Glue Boards work as well as the single included glue board that comes with theFly Web Fly Trap. To be clear, this is not a standalone product, they are designed to be used in the \"Fly Web Fly Trap\".The Glue Boards have a protective sheet that needs to be removed before they inserted in the dedicated slot of the main unit. This is easy to do and it works reasonably well.We did a comparison of the \"Fly Web Fly Trap\" verses theTerro 2500 Fruit Fly TrapandFly Paper Strips, Fly Catcher Trap, Victor Fly Bait 4 Pack, with the old fashion but very ugly Flay Paper Strips winning hands down.Recommended, if you own theFly Web Fly TrapCFH
B0006OIZO8 These pads are great!! and the only thing that I have used that is 99.9% effective with knats and fruit flies.
B0006OIZO8 Talk about &#34;stick to.&#34;  This board has it.  I positioned the fly catcher next to my double doors leading to the deck.  I am surprised how many insects it catches -- I didn't know so many were dropping by.  I like it because, of course, it works but also there is no odor to deal with and changing glue boards is a snap.  The boards are cheap enough to keep it relatively clean all the time.  A good investment.
B0006OIZO8 Holds a ridiculous amount of flying nasties that you don't like. Cost is one dollar per sheet, and sheets can last 3 days (if you live in the rainforest and leave all your windows open, or about two weeks if you live in a normal urban home.I live deep in the woods in the Midwest, and change these about once a week and the house is free of all flying buzzers and buggers.
B0006OIZO8 These work and fit fine into the original units, Web Fly Trap by Gardner, as advertised. And while not cheap, not terribly expensive.
B0006OIZO8 This glue board is for use with their Fly Web trap ([...]).  THis is a great product because unlike bug zappers it is safe.  it also catches very very small flying insects like gnats and baby mosquito's.
B0006TYH2M I have tried several hummingbird feeders and while I've only had this one a few days it should be great.  It comes apart easily.  The liquid goes in the bottom section so nothing has to be turned upside down for filling which should eliminate sugar water dripping.  It even has a built in ant trap in the middle.
B0006TYH2M Don't even bother buying another hummingbird feeder.  This is the best.  It's easy to clean and refill.  And the built-in ant moat works great.  I bought the smaller one last year, and the hummers LOVED it.  So I upgraded and bought the larger one for next spring.  Now I'll use both in separate locations so they don't fight over it.
B0006TYH2M Easy to fill.  Easy to clean.  Easy to judge when a refill is necessary.  Ant-proof.What's not to like?  I have 3 and they are busy all summer long.
B0006TYH2M Hummzingers are the best feeders.  It's easy to clean, and attracts lots of hummingbirds.  I have another smaller hummzinger feeder, and am happy with that one as well.
B0006TYH2M Experiments have shown that BPA is harmful to animals with negative impacts on functions including development, metabolism, reproductive activity and many more (E.g., see Science Daily \"Harmful effects of bisphenol A demonstrated experimentally\", January 22, 2013, or Google for a very long list of other articles. The danger of BPA has pretty well become common knowledge at this point and doesn't seem to be disputed.)I emailed Aspects to ask if this feeder contains BPA because it was not clear that it did not. I received a reply from Carol that Aspects does use BPA in this and all their other polycarbonate feeders. She also said they have no current intent to make a BPA-free feeder. Let's encourage them to change that stance!I think it goes without saying that we should not be feeding our beautiful wildlife chemicals that harm them if we care about them as much as we like to think we do. Even if one isn't concerned about the first generation of hummingbirds, consider the likely possibility that the chemicals are also transferred to offspring during gestation and may accumulate through generations. Furthermore, consider the food chain and the general fact that we're putting these chemicals out in our environment.Nalgene and other companies have removed BPA from their plastics and still make very strong and aesthetic plastics without it. This feeder has many _great_ properties, but it's not the only feeder with them; personally I will buy alternatives until Aspects decides to make a BPA-free hummingbird feeder to purchase one of theirs. I would love to see them do so.
B0006TYH2M Attracts the hummers amd keeps them around.  Much easier to clean than the glass bottle variety.
B0006U2FJ8 I feed birds all winter and the sparrows, cardinals, finches, etc. - all come to eat.  In past years water that wasn't ice was the one thing they needed to sustain them.  I bought this to use in a birdbath so that my birds could drink, as well as, eat all winter.  It's very economical to use and the birds think it's just a rock at the bottom of the bird bath.  I'm very pleased with this item.  I would recommend it to anyone interested in keeping our &#34;feathered friends&#34; going over the winter.
B0006U2FJ8 This piece of equipment does a respectable job of keeping at least a little part of the surface of the bird-bath free of ice during the winter.  Once the temps get down close to zero F., there's not much open water left for the thirsty birdies, but it has never allowed the surface to totally freeze over.
B0006U2FJ8 And hasn't GOTTEN to -20 below! It's the end of January here in CT and we've had several nights of 0 to 15 below (including wind chill). I just went out to check on the birdbath and it's iced up solid as a rock. There isn't even any remote warmth towards the top of the &#34;De-Icer&#34;. I gave it a four star because I truly like this thing! It's worked through anything above 0 up until this point. I'm really not sure that anything 50 watts would go to -20, but I figured in this part of New England, I wouldn't have to worry. I'm hoping it's not broken at all, but I'll have to wait and see if it does its job when it gets a little warmer (like in the teens or twenties).Again, four stars, because it was totally worth it up to this point and we don't get this bitter cold weather here very often (or for very long periods of time). I just thought it should be mentioned so prospective buyers would be aware:)
B0006U2FJ8 I used this during the Nebraska winter with temperatures regularly dipping into the single digits.  The de-icer keeps the water warm enough for algae to continue growing.  Of course, the area of ice-free water will depend on how cold it is:  After all, this thing is not a 1000-watt power hog.  When temps dip into the single digits, I typically see about an 8-inch diameter circle of ice-free water.  User submitted pictures illustrate this accurately.  (My bird bath is about 2.5 inches deep at its deepest point).It is my understanding that birds do not bathe during the winter because of the danger that their feathers will become wet and subsequently freeze.  Therefore, I don't think it's important to keep the entire bird bath ice-free.  Instead, birds just need enough clear water for drinking.  Indeed, drinking is all I've seen them do during the winter, even on days when the entire bird bath is ice-free.  Because of that, I see no reason to buy a super warm energy hogging de-icer.The cord is heavy duty and the de-icer itself has some weight to it.  Still, I put a brick on the cord to keep the de-icer situated properly in my bird bath.I get more birds at my bird bath during the winter than I do during the summer...most likely because it is the only source of unfrozen water for some distance.  Squirrels also enjoy the open water.  I'm very pleased with the purchase.
B0006U2FJ8 Bought this in the summer (much cheaper then) and put it out about 2 months ago.  We have our own \"homemade\" fountain which consists of a large pot that holds about 10 gallons of water and a shallow dish on top.This product is able to keep the water liquid, combined with the moving water from the fountain.  Night time temps have averaging about 15 F.  The birds have been flocking to it.The cord is very, very short, about a foot long.  That is one drawback because you will need an outdoor extension cord. It is sturdy and does not get too warm.  You can easily pick it up with your bare hands when it is running.Did not notice the impact on the electric bill.
B0006U2FJ8 This little heater is actually one of the few products I have ever purchased which was far better than even advertized.  I have three birdbaths and have one in each.  These work wonderfully and I have had no problem what so ever even on the coldest days and nights.  I also have a smallish fish pond near my porch and I have used two of these things in it.  As with the birdbaths, they work perfectly.  Normally I have to remove the fish during the winter, but so far have not had to go through that chore.  We live in an area where we have frequent freezing weather but never down into the single digits so I don't think that will be a problem.  People do not realize that birds drink during the winter months as they do during the summer and that this can cause them problems if they do not have a reliable source of water.  I must say that the squirrels and other critters that surround our place enjoy it too.  As I said, this is a product that I truly got my monies worth from.
B0006U66B6 Well constructed and made of heavy brass.  Valve turns smoothly with little effort.  Will definitely buy more.  The black plastic ring helps you hold it while attaching it to the hose.
B0006U66B6 I GOT SEVERAL OF THESE AND PUT A QUICK CONNECTION ON THEM TO USE ON THE FAUCET TO SLOW THE WATER FLOW BECAUSE WHEN YOU USE THE FAUCET TO SLOW DOWN THE WATER FLOW IT WILL EVENTUALLY CUT A SMALL GAP IN THE FAUCET CAUSING IT TO LEAK AND THEN IT WILL HAVE TO BE REPLACED.
B0006U66B6 Must have shut-off valve so you dont have to keep running back to the main valve to cut the water on/off when changing attachments.
B0006U66B6 I was looking in the big box stores for this, but all I found was plastic or a poly type.  Gilmour makes quality items, and you can rest assured it will stand the test of time.
B0006U66B6 I wasn't sure if I should buy it.  Glad I did.  Solid product.  Easy to connect and turn ON and OFF.  Does not leak.  Just feels solid.  Able to use grip to apply added pressure when tightening.  Good product for the price.
B0006U66B6 High Quality materials used.  I purchased to replace a low-quality plastic one I previously bought elsewhere.  This one appears to be made of heavy metal.
B0006U66B6 I hooked these up to all my garden hose attachments so I could put a quick connect on my hose. Before the quick connect I put on this brass shut off valve. Now I dont have to run 100 feet to turn off the water, or kink the hose to switch attachments.. I love it
B0006U66B6 I bought a couple of different Gilmour Brass Shut-Off Valves as a way to block water flow from leaky outdoor faucets. There are better and more expensive alternatives but this valve works just fine for me. Replacing the washer in a faucet here in the Atlanta area by a plumber will run about 85 bucks or more. You can do it for a lot less yourself if conditions are favorable for you to do so. By that I mean if you have easy access to turning off your water supply and you have the tools and replacement washers to do the job. Or, you can take the easy way out and attach this valve to your faucet and have control of the leaks. Some outdoor faucets do require washer replacement to stop the leak because of the way they are constructed. I am fortunate not to have that type. My only complaint is that the Bosch Corp chooses to have these valves made in China rather than creating jobs here in the USA. But this is a review of the valve itself so I must give it 5 stars and a big BOO! to the Robert Bosch Tool Corp for pimping jobs in China though they have a presence in Peoria IL.
B0006U66B6 this is well built and serves it's purpose functionally.my complaint is that the hole inside the shutoff valve/bearing is considerably smaller than the width of the hose connection.  when putting this on, you are basically blocking off around half of the capacity of whatever is after it in the chain.i use it at the end of my hose, right before my gilmour quick connects, so that when i change out my sprinklers and nozzles, i don't have to walk across the yard to turn off the hose so that i don't get sprayed (so lazy).  it works fine, and i haven't seen any real loss of range with the water, but i think the change would be noticeable if i put another hose after this connector.
B0006U66B6 This is solid compare to the similar plastic connectors. I also found the valve easier to twist. My wife can even twist it off and on. The large female side allows the connection to be made flawlessly and drip proof.
B0006U66B6 I needed a shut off valve when cleaning a spa with a hose vacuum. This one is surprisingly well-constructed and functions easily and well.
B0006U66B6 Before ordering, I was afraid of having a cheap plastic bearing inside.  No where in the internet, including manufacturer's web site, I could check the spec on this part, nor anyone of reviewers commented on the type of ball inside.  This one does incorporates metal ball bearing, but have a similar characteristics as $0.99 plastic part, badly leaking water at the joint.  Time wasted to make it function like a simple shut-off valve, in order to save time required on returning, just priceless.  Now, I understand why unusually high number of negative feedback on this junk.  Over last few years, we have become so acquainted to junk imported from China, it's just amazing how some users will tolerate badly designed and manufactured pats.I had no idea that designing a water shut-off valve was such a difficult task, that requires a special skill.  It's made to leak, no matter how much connector is tightened.  I thought Gilmour was a reputable American manufacturer, and I'm totally off.  Do engineers at Gilmore check the prototype before sending its design to full production, or do marketing people actually check if it's viable product?  Please do not write reviews without thoroughly checking them first, or post phony reviews your untruthful reviews are wasting other people's valuable time.
B0006U66B6 I have these Gilmour connectors all around the house, and I love them.  They are practically indestructable, and exceeds my expectations.  I have them hooked up to hoses, bypassing our water softener.  I also use the double connectorsGilmour 13 Brass 2-Way Connectoras well, which are equally as good.  A must have for every home.I recommend using this with a small piece of teflon to prevent corrosion at the connectors.  If corrosion does take place, it can become very difficult to unscrew it.
B0006U66B6 I ordered these as they were not plastic and were made of brass.  They are heavy duty and work well so I am glad that I purchased them.
B0006U66B6 This is exactly as advertised.  It is a solid piece, feels substantial and does exactly what I wanted.  The price on this was dramatically lower than the same thing at the local big box store and hardware store.
B0006VK68E Works great to get seeds started and roots going; especially along with using the Hydrofarm JSV2 2-Foot Jump Start T5 Grow Light System
B0006VK68E To start with I do a lot of gardening. I have over 15 species of fruit tree in my yard, a 1000 sq ft garden, and also have a wide diversity of flowering plants in my yard to promote species diversity, attract beneficial insects, and, of course, for ascetic appeal.I use this humidity dome for both cuttings and seed starting. To cut to the chase the product does indeed work as intended with some caveats.Lets start with the heat mat. The heat mat itself works as intended. It keeps an even and warm temperature, but the diagram says to place it under the hot house, so the perfectly heated mat sits below not one, but two pieces of plastic with air in between them. Plastic is not a good conductor of heat, so the mat becomes far less effective if used as indicated. For myself I have a fluorescent tube light hanging a food above the humidity dome, so the heat inside stays a nice 85 degrees Farenheit.The dome itself has 3 vents. 1 at the top, and one on each side. Even with a number of adjustments airflow is stagnant. I open the dome and let a fan sit on it for a few seconds in the morning and evening to prevent stagnant air accumulation.Also it comes with a very, very small sample of Clonex, which is inconveniently placed in a package that makes dipping cuttings quite difficult. I get the product placement thing, but they didn't plan that one out too well.I'd rather pay less and skip the Clonex. I do however own and use Clonex religiously as I have found it to be the most effective rotting gel around. I just don't want a messy and small sample pack of it.I decided on 3 stars because all my cuttings and seedlings have done quite well, however, they also needed regular attention. An ideal humidity dome would require far less attention. on top of that the instructions tell you to place the heat mat in a spot that reduces its effectiveness.
B0006VK68E I wanted a heating pad so I figured I'd get the whole kit.  This kit is a bit disappointing because the plastic dome does not fit well on the base so there is an air gap.  I have this sitting on a wooden floor and the heater has worked fine.  I just think it was very overpriced for what I got.  The plastic parts are thin and would require me to be careful if I want to use them for years to come.  I had hoped for better.
B0006VK68E This does not come with the pellets. It also does not say that it does. Maybe the description has been edited after someone complained, but it clearly says that its a \"72-insert tray\" NOT that the inserts are included. Here are some tips.If you don't want to spend the money for more jiffy pellets at least get a good seed starting soil or add a B-vitamin fertilizer to a traditional potting/garden soil to assist in healthy root development. If you use a traditional soil with fertilizers be sure to add a diluted plant fertilizer when sprouts appear. Seedlings burn easy, you do not want to over-fertilize them. This will make transplanting difficult!!Mold can grow very quickly, which is why commercial hydrofarmers use fungicides. Root rot is one of the most common killers of hydro grown plants. You can purchase a good fungicide for around $8. If you get a concentrated version be sure to follow the dilution directions exactly. More is NOT better.You should also be aware of your water quality if you are using tap. Some municipal supplies are highly chlorinated and/or not pH balanced. This can result in sprouts that appear then quickly burn, yellow and die. If you want fantastic results get a pH/Chlorine kit ($20, or you could even get aquarium test strips to make it easier/cheaper) and check your water before beginning any sort of hydrofarm. Additives can be purchased to alter the pH, if your water is highly chlorinated, use filtered with a hydro-fertilizer.Some of the heat mats are not calibrated correctly, its a factory issue. Be sure to place the heat mat on a solid topped table, not glass, and to be extra careful (if you're worried) place a towel over the heat mat to help diffuse the heat (this will not negatively impact the effect the heat has on the seedlings). The heat mat is not even required, you could toss it as long as your hydrofarm is indoors and gets sufficient sunlight throughout the day to maintain warmth. They do not mention all of these things because if they make it sound complicated they don't sell as much product. In fact it is all VERY simple. There are just a few extra steps one should take if they are serious about obtaining great results. My personal opinion, steer clear of Miracle-Gro, use Schultz NPK 10-15-10 ($ the one with the eyedropper, very cheap) or Fox Farm ($$$ if you want to spend money). My grandparents were orchard farmers, I've seen these cheap plastic cloning trays work very well for many years with the proper pellet inserts and fertilizers.
B0006VK68E I cooked my seeds with this contraption. The heating pad would be infinitely better if it had temperature control. Though all in all I like that all the components were included.
B0006VK68E I placed seeds into a miracle grow potting mix, watered, then covered up the dome and in 3 days every one of the 12 species had sprouted to about an inch tall (or more in the case of fast growing sunflowers).Echinacea, red lettuce, romaine lettuce, snap peas, orange sunflower, red sunflower, chives, 4 different heirloom tomatoes, and dill - all of them are growing like weeds.  As soon as they're big enough for transplanting, I'll be using it again to sprout another 12 or so species for the spring garden.The moisture level is pretty constant after te first and only watering 10 days ago, since you can keep the dome mostly shut (or open it up if that's too wet).My only complaint is that the dome dribbles water when you move it since the set is designed with the clear plastic dome on top/over the edge.  But, that was nothing a tea towel under the seed bed doesn't fix.  For the price, I really couldn't be happier!
B0006VK68E This simple and inexpensive pad has been WONDERFUL.  The difference it makes in sprouting my seeds is incredible.  At first, I cautiously placed the pad and greenhouse on a table, fussing over it. Now, its on the tile floor (with a towel underneath to keep the cold ceramic tile from leaching too much heat) and works well without notice.It comes with a plastic egg-carton like tray to start your own seeds with your own soil.  However, I'm lazy.  I just put one of those square trays with the soil pellets in them ($5 from the hardware store) to start my seeds instead; fits and works perfectly.I will not be without this ever.  Temperature is great.  Keeps a consistent warmth into the soil.STRONGLY RECOMMEND.
B0006VK68E I find that convenience often outweighs the quality or even usability of the product. The thought that you could just place your plants out of sight out of mind while some miraculous grow kit does the work for you is an ideal based on nonsense. If it was that easy, there wouldn't be instructions.I have found that warmth assists in germination over 40 years of gardening. But I don't buy a dedicated germination kit. The standard seeding kits available for $3.00 are fine. I have one I like for the windowsill, not because I love the brand or soil it contains, but because it FITS ON THE WINDOWSILL!! That makes it convenient for me and agreeable to the wife.Heating pads are kind of silly. The cost is ridiculous and, if you really want to heat your seedlings, then put an electric blanket or throw under them. You can get a single blanket electric or throw for about $20 and you can sit like 6 of these starter trays on them and warm them all with a totally reusable unit.I did notice that when on the electric blanket, the seedlings start a bit earlier. And if in a colder area (basement/attic) the blanket was essential to get them to kick into gear. But the blanket is huge and you can cover a much wider starting area. If you want a smaller area, fold the blanket. Low temp is usually enough to keep my kit around 70, but your environment may be different. Don't put either outside in 20 degree weather or you will get chilling results.At any rate, these warming seed starting kits are a waste of money. If you have absolutely no sun exposure or are starting so many you can't keep them in the house on a window sill or near any window, then get a heating blanket and a grow light. Much cheaper in the long run.
B0006VK68E This Hydrofarm hothouse with heat mat is a simple and effective way to start your plants from seed. The heat mat in particular will last you years and years most likely. The hothouse itself is of questionable manufacture, being a flimsy plastic, but it does what it is supposed to perfectly. There is a vent on top and one to either side of it as well to help control the temp and humidity if you dont use a guage. The 72 seed cells are likewise nothing special, but are again, quite effective. I have placed a variety of seeds in this, from tomatoes, to peppers to quinoa to tobacco, and everything tends to spout within 4 to 7 days. Anyways, even though of flimsy manufacture, the price is right and the goods are effective, so i give this 4 stars accordingly. Just be gentle with it, and if necessary, save the mat in the event that you damage the hothouse.Enjoy!
B0006VK68E I bought this item to start seeds and try my hand at cloning for the first time.  In both regards it has performed to my satisfaction.  A few points:- The dome is thin plastic.  I mean like solo cup thin.  It wouldn't take much to completely destroy it.  My small accurite thermo sitting on top makes a nice dent in it.- It leaks.  The condensate on the dome rolls down the sides and out of the edges.  This could have been easily fixed by making the dome fit inside the base instead of the outside.  Try not to put anything you don't want wet underneath this.- The heat mat, despite being several layers of plastic below the grow chamber, keeps a nice amount of warmth and humidity in the dome.  On last measurement I was at 89% RH and 81 degrees with half the top vent open.  The ambient temperature of my basement is around 65f.- It's big!  From the picture it just doesn't look all that impressive, but when you get the box you realize this guy is pretty large.  Make sure and check the dimensions!- The holes for the inserts fit rapid rooters perfectly!Following some simple direction was all that was needed to achieve successful results using this item.  I filled the base of the item with Ph adjusted water just to where the bottoms of the cups were submerged.  Soaked my rapid rooters in Ph adjusted water as well and dropped my seeds/clones in.  Plugged in the heat mat and set it under my 2ft T-5 fixture.  Within a week I spotted a few seeds germinating, and my clones looked just as good as the day I clipped them.  A week after that my clones had put on a decent amount of roots.  Mostly I have been screwing around with cloning just to see if I could do it, and I am 20 for 20 thus far.I think the real trick is to just leave the damn thing alone.  The more people fiddle around with the top off the more time it takes building up the humid environment again.  That's my trick anyways and it seems to be paying off.  I will only take the top off when it is time to transplant.I read several negative reviews about this item before I purchased it, and for the most part they are correct.  Despite being happy with this product I deducted a star because of the slight water leakage.  I mean there is a electrical device sitting under this thing that leaks water.  I'm no electrical engineer, but common sense tells me that one should take precautions when using this thing.Once again though it is the price that makes me recommend this.  You aren't going to find anything even close to this price that has the utility of this item.
B0006VK68E Bought this for my floral/dried flowers and spice business.The heated mat is the answer for it's ease of growing.My plants for the garden were germinated and on their way ,even when growing season was delayed .I bought two and now have a garden growing mostly from seeds(great seeds available on Amazon)
B0006VK68E Some have said that they thought this was a bit pricey for what you get. I agree - the little hot house is lightweight plastic, and they could have thrown in the peat pellets. I can buy a 72 peat pellet hot house by a competitor, with the pellets included, mind you, at a big-box retailer, for about $7.HOWEVER, that one only has a 2-inch transparent plastic top on it - and this one has 7 inches of growing room. In addition, this has some simple but effective adjustable vents in the hood - both ends and in the top - which are useful to control the humidity level.Since I had to go buy the pellets anyway, I got the 2-inch hothouse they came in. I started my seeds in it, and now that they're up, I've moved thed them to the Hydrofarm product, which offers increased growing space.What you're really paying for is the Heat Mat. It's a great idea to have a consistent heat under germinating seedlings! Before it arrived, I tried a few basil seeds in a kitchen window, and one night it got cold. Bang. Poor little guys are casualties.Now, in the Hot House with the Heat Mat, all my babies are fine, thank you! By the way - you will need aHydrofarm MTPRTC Digital Thermostat For Heat Matsto control the heat - sold separately.I've got them both, and they work well together. You plug the Heat Mat's electrical cord into the Thermostat, which plugs into the wall. Oh yes - the Thermostat comes with a probe you place inside the Hot House, where it can read the actual temperature your seedlings are at.Recommended!
B0006VK68E Very happy with the product.  The heat is consistent and I love the ability to adjust airflow.  The only suggestion and reason for 4 starts instead of five is that condensation tends to drip out.  The plastic could have been moulded with the lip turned up and drain ridges put in which would have kept the condensation in.  It doesn't pour out or anything but I've had to put a piece of cardboard and a garbage bag under the unit to prevent it from ruining my table.  Also happy with Amazon shipping to Japan for me since, even with shipping, it's cheaper than what is available here.  Will definitely be ordering more Hydrofarm products in the future.
B0006VK68E When I first opened the package, I was disappointed.  This cover and box is about the same thickness & quality as a jiffy mini-greenhouse that you could pick up for less than 10 bucks.  If you're expecting a heavy duty piece, this isn't for you.  It seems to do the job though.  The little side and top vents are the same quality as the rest, so don't expect anything mind-blowing.  On the positive side they seem to do a pretty good job controlling humidity.  I have them just a crack open to keep things nice and moist and the heating pad is generating enough heat to fog up the cover.  As long as it doesn't fall over and get stepped on, I am sure I'll be happy.  One misstep though and this thing is going to crack and be ready for the trash bin.  I WOULD buy this again, although I'd be much happier if it were 15 bucks.
B0006ZI6H8 I looked at many different hose timers and settled on this one because of the high ratio of 5-star to 1-star reviews. There will always be a few units that don't work properly or a few people that are hard to satisfy but this timer should please the most critical of users.This unit does almost everything that a standard, multi-zone sprinlker timer does except have multiple zones. You can select days to turn on or two or three days between waterings. For each watering you may specify up to four time periods with a start time and a duration between 1 and 360 minutes. The timer section easily slides off the valve body so you can program it at your kitchen table without removing it from the faucet. From the time I unpacked this device to the time I installed it and started its use took approximately 30 minutes. Let me tell you how I am using it.I had a deer problem with my front gardens. They would eat my flowers. I purchased a Scarecrow motion-activated sprinkler (see other review) and set it up to try. It was wonderful and completely eliminated my problem. Having determined that it worked, I wished to eliminate the need for me to turn it on at night and off in the morning. That is where the Orbit timer comes in. I connected the timer to my faucet via a Gilmour 13 Brass 2-Way Connector (see other review) and now have a deer-proofed yard without fiddling.Note that the timer requires two 9-volt batteries in a relatively watertight compartment and you must supply these. Not a problem in my book as it insures that I start with fresh batteries. They should last all season according to what I have read. So, as long as it works properly and lasts a few seasons, I won't complain.
B0006ZI6H8 This Orbit 62001 Lawn and Garden Digital Watering Timer is handy for automatic watering of trees and shrubs. It operates on two 9-volt batteries. It consists of a motor-operated valve and a timer.  The user attaches the female coupling of the valve to a hose bib and the male coupling to a garden hose or drip irrigation pipe.  The timer can be removed from the assembly for easy programming.  There are four watering cycles per day; it can be programmed to run seven days or any day(s) of the week, or every 2nd day or 3rd day. The timer can also be turned on manually.  However, each cycle or manual operation lasts only up to 6 hours.  I found it inadequate because I use the timer for drip irrigation, which by its nature can last a lot more than 6 hours.  Other than the short duration, this Orbit timer runs well.
B0006ZI6H8 This unit works reliably as described and being able to remove the programming module is a real benefit, but there are some shortcomings that need to be considered.  On the plus side, the thing works.  That's important to me as I tried another that wasn't so reliable and since I'm on a well and would be away when the unit is on, having it function correctly ranks very high on my list of required features.  Even if the battery runs out (it's suppose to last all season) the unit quits in the off position, so the water is not left running until the well is dry.A feature that I like very much is that the electronic module slips out of the spigot attachment bar easily so you can see the screen better for programming or reprogramming.  Sometimes a spigot is located where visibility is poor and it helps me particularly because the screen is not large and the instructions on the flip up cover are really tiny.  The programming would not be intuitive to me, but with the instructions right there, it's easy enough.Thanks to other reviewers, I had the two 9V batteries on hand, but didn't heed the advice to have a Y connector on hand for a second hose for manual use. I thought I could easily reset the unit to allow that.  Well, you can hand water by pushing the button for manual operation, but then you also have to set the number of minutes you intend to be watering manually, after which it resets to auto/run, and you can't just hit the program off button because 'off' doesn't allow water to flow.The problem is I have no idea how long I'll be using the hose manually.  It could be the standard 10'ish minutes of watering the hanging baskets, but I may want to alter that routine for some reason this time or I may be interrupted or maybe the dog bowl needs filling or a trash can needs to be washed or the car.  You get the picture.  In short, I don't know how many minutes I need and don't want to think about that every time, nor hold the + button for lots of minutes just in case.  That's just way more effort than I want to put into using the water for a dozen reasons (especially when it's over 100 outside).  Having the Y connector avoids that problem if the timer is to be installed on a frequently used spigot.The other brand I tried before (that I returned for non-performance) allowed for two hoses so I hadn't considered the extra annoyance of switching repeatedly from the hand-use nozzle to the sprinkler, nor the fact that my main hose is white and doesn't look very good snaked out through the yard to the sprinkler location (normally it's wrapped up after each use on a hose cart).  Sigh.  I've now ordered a Y connector and have to wait to hook it up.  (Yes, I know, why didn't I just drive in town to get one at the hardware store--well, I did, and the dumb thing leaked, so I've ordered a higher quality unit.) Who knew this would be so complicated.I do wish I could review my watering program as with the other unit, but that isn't an option with this one. It does show the time and day and you can push various buttons to see what you'd set as start time and duration.  Speaking of which, you will not want to reset start time very often because the buttons are rather hard to push and you have to hold the + or - button forever while it starts at 12am and moves up or down by the minute (not hour then minute, just minute, all 60 of them each hour) to reach your desired time.Bottom line, I'm not thrilled with some of this unit's features, but it works and that is the top priority.  With a separate hose for other watering activities, I'll be satisfied with this timer to handle my automated watering needs and feel confident while I'm away.
B0006ZI6H8 This timer looks good and works well. It is easy to program or to change functions such as days to water, watering time, etc. The ability to remove the control section from the valve is a real plus, I set it up in the cool of my house instead of our 100F+ Texas heat. Reliability remains a question. We have only had it about a month, but so far it works well.  It feeds a 12 psi pressure regulator and 150 ft of soaker hose, a very nice setup!Update 10/2010. We are approaching the end of the second full season of use with this water timer. It has worked flawlessly. For reliable operation, depending on use, you have to be prepared to replace a battery at least once per season.Update 5/2013. We are in our fourth year using this Orbit watering timer. We are ordering a second one as our garden is expanding. Usually we put the unit in storage for the winter, however, as it rarely gets below 20 deg F, and does not freeze for extended periods, we let it operate year around for the past year. The only problem we have had is corrosion on one of the battery terminals (that occurred several years ago), that supplies power to the valve. A thorough cleaning solved that and operation has been reliable since then.
B0006ZI6H8 Good news is it has held up for a couple of years, bad news is I had a hell of  time programming it, and it was very expensive.  It's not an easy unit to set up, but it does work if you figure it out.  I won't buy another (there are others on the market that work as well that are cheaper and easier--more like a digital watch--to program).
B0006ZI6H8 This would be a great timer. It is easy to set. Keeps the settings when you change batteries. Resists water. Allows manual override and lets you remove the timer from the valve to program. The big problem that it shares with most of these timers is lack of reliability. Mine stopped working within a week. The company was very easy to deal with and offered to ship a new one next day but I need a timer now or my plants will die so I will return it to Amazon.
B0006ZI6H8 Mine lasted for two seasons ,it worked well while it worked,,,,,I have used 4or 5 different timers and none of them last more than 2 seasons,,,My next purchase is the Orbit 91213....looks nice,,we will see.
B0006ZI6H8 So far I've purchased two of the Orbit 62001 Lawn Timers, but I've gone through about four of them with Amazon and the local mega-mart. The first 62001 I purchased in 2008 died (and it was my fault) when I left it out for a day during a freeze (note: I live in southern Texas, and by \"freeze\" I meant - it hit 30 for about two hours at night). The digital portion worked fine but the actual physical housing which rotated the open-and-close water flow restrictor would simply no longer operate. I replaced this unit with another from Amazon and it worked fine for the following summer. Having learned my lesson, I unhooked the timer for the next winter and left it in a dry, insulated, garage. The garage would hit a low of around 40 versus the outdoor temperature of 30 or less. The garage never hit freezing temperatures and the batteries were out of the unit until the following spring. When spring came, the same problem occurred - the digital portion worked fine, the physical water restrictor would no longer move. I ordered replacement #3 from Amazon and this time straight out of the clamshell the unit would not work - same exact issue. I returned the unit to Amazon and grabbed a replacement from the local mega mart - again, same exact issue.Now, I should state that I live in an area with hard water and yes I can see that being a possible issue.  Perhaps gunking up the the inner-workings of these timers and restricting the mechanics from moving about properly. However with my two \"mostly-broken\" units I've torn them apart and found no calcium build up on the regulator or even evidence of rust or circuit corrosion (I am not an engineer but when comparing a working to non-working unit, it all looked the same). I should also note that I have aOrbit 62032 Yard Watering Systemin my backyard and it has been working fine for three years running. After multiple tries with the 62001, I've stepped down to the slightly less functionally robustOrbit 62061N Single-Dial Water Timerin hopes that it might last longer than a year.I've given these units two stars (instead of one) because there is the slightest chance that I simply might have been unlucky with my four units. When these worked, they worked flawlessly day-after-day. Multiple timers and day-to-day nuances made watering during drought restrictions a breeze. I just wish they would last.
B0006ZI6H8 This unit is easy to program and was the closest hose timer that resembled  controllers on irrigation systems.  You can set days to water, set the start times and duration of 4 individual watering times a day, manually override, delay 24hrs for days it rains... perfect.  However, this unit will not be adequate if you have long runs where every little bit of water pressure counts.  When open to water, it is restrictive and you will lose some water pressure.  A shame really.
B00075M3W6 This was the third one I purchased as my other two just stopped working after 2 seasons. This one didn't even last this season. not wasting any more money on these things.
B00075M3W6 I have an odd birdbath arrangement on my deck that allowed me to test this unit's effectiveness. There is no question the birds prefer it, and though I still find mosquito larvae, there are fewer.  I have two identical birdbaths next to each other and found that when I added the Water Wiggler to one, the birds went to it exclusively over the other.  It was so obvious they liked it, I bought a second for the other bath.Last year I replaced two end tables and temporarily stored the old ones next to one another on my deck covered with a tarp.  I had removed the glass that had been set in the tops when I stored the tables and then a heavy rain created pools in the rectangular depressions.  I noticed that the birds found this arrangement just right for bathing as the depressions are shallow and the space is good sized.  Since I enjoyed watching the birds drinking and bathing, I decided to leave the tables there, but the standing water caused mosquito issues so I purchased a Water Wiggler to deter that and set it in one of the depressions.  Almost immediately, the birds gravitated to that space leaving the other unused.  Now both pools have Water Wigglers.  I still check them for larvae and algae and have to replace the water regularly, but that's easy and the birds are happy.  While I have a well-attended normal birdbath in my backyard, some birds won't go to it.  The thrushes and warblers apparently aren't comfortable there, but do come to the deck baths with the moving water.I found one set of batteries kept each unit working all last summer and fall.  I replaced the batteries this spring and they are going strong.  They seem to be quite sturdy as visiting night creatures sometimes knock them over or even out of the baths, but I put them back in each time and they show no signs of complaint.
B00075M3W6 I have owned this little unit for over a year and it works great.  Why? It is hard for birds to judge the depth of the water when it is not moving so they may pass over your bath thinking that it is too deep.  (this may sound silly to us, but it is true).  I get 2-3 times more birdbath activity now.  You still have to clean your water and I remove the Wiggler before winter.  The batteries last many months.  Honestly, the price is a little steep for what it is, but it is worth it for what it does - attracts more birds.  It should last many seasons with proper care.
B00075M3W6 Granted, out of the box this API water agitator doesn't look like much. Packaged with (3) metal legs, (4) rubber anchors and (1) metal agitator, set up takes seconds. I slapped in two D cell batteries (not included) and placed this unit into our bird bath. I like the fact that no wiring is required. It is quiet. The continuous agitation does repel mosquitoes. There is a rubber gasket in place to prevent water seepage into the motor housing. Trust me it doesn't work.I'm not a big fan of the snap in metal legs. The legs have fallen out of their slots on more then one occasion. I get about three months juice before its time to replace the batteries. I add algaecide to aid in keeping the water clear. It must work because I see both birds and butterflies dropping in for a visit. Now the bad news. It didn't even make through the summer. The high price tag on this lemon is another reason to think other options.
B00075M3W6 just recently bought this and it keeps the water moving which is what I wanted. So far it has not attracted any birds in fact it only about 5ft away from a mounted smaller bird bath which they do use to drink from , they just ignore this one but I will give it time and see what happens.
B00075M3W6 This 5.5-inch plastic and metal dome-shaped device when placed in a birdbath, armed with two D size batteries, wiggles the water creating silent concentric ripples from end to end. So why would anyone spend twenty or more dollars for a contraption that looks like a breast on stilts and just sits in the backyard birdbath? A fondness for concentricity? A touch of avian eccentricity? A passion for safe electricity? A love of simplicity? Read on.Rationale for the Water Wiggler from Allied Precision IndustriesStill water in a container eventually becomes stagnant, the sides and bottom of the water's receptacle becoming green and slimy with what we technically call gunk. The still water is also an attractive destination for mosquitoes, a safe place for these critters to lay their eggs ensuring the continuation of the vile species. A spinner on the bottom of the Water Wiggler agitates the water (but not the parched birds), creating continuous, gentle ripples in the birdbath's water and discouraging, maybe even preventing, mosquitoes from laying their eggs in birdbaths. The moving water is said to attract birds and more importantly \"helps prevent the spread of west Nile virus by eliminating still water in birdbaths.Product Features:Easy to install. (Unless you are very, very short, Shleppies!) Just set it in the water. No Wires! No plumbing! No cumbersome extension cords!Operates on just two D-cell batteries for a full season of continuous use. (Unless you live in a state with one yearlong season.)Operates 24 hours a day. (Great for those night owls)Silent. And very quiet too.Full one year warrantyMay use in the winter to agitate the water and attract more birds. (Probably won't discourage too many mosquitoes in the winter)In the Backyard Birdbath on Spud AcresWe used the water wiggler in one of our three birdbaths for two seasons, and despite my initial skepticism, seemed to fulfill most of its promise. The birdbath with the wiggler was by far the most popular, attracting many birds for baths, drinks or a ringside perch. A birdbath housing a Water Wiggler still has to be cleaned, just a little less often. I know I felt so much more comfortable knowing I wasn't contending with despicable mosquitoes or putting myself at risk of contracting a mosquito-borne disease. What does one do with a perpetually wiggling device while cleaning the birdbath? Sometimes I held it in one hand and cleaned with the other. At other times I enlisted a helper to hold the wiggler while I cleaned and refreshed the water. And there were also those times when I just laid the little round wiggler on its back.Several times a season I found the wiggler on the ground, spinning away, just wiggling in the breeze. I can only guess what manner of varmint villain caused the displacement of our innocent wiggler. Raccoon? Possum? Owl? Eagle? Or maybe one of those mischievous squirrels that live to antagonize. Except for the most recent occasion, it was just a simple matter of rinsing off and replacing the little wiggler. Several weeks ago, however, the entire heavy, cast concrete birdbath was totally toppled, the water wiggle lying in pieces on the ground. I tried to reinsert the spinner but it was too misshapen. Its one year warranty hadn't expired, but in our anguish neither Mrs. Spudman nor myself thought of contacting Allied Precision Industries for a replacement. The damaged wiggler now rests somewhere in the county landfill. Since the fallen birdbath is so heavy I can only guess that the culprit this time was a large raccoon, a deer, or one of the wild potatoes that lurk in the deep woods.VerdictI'm not sure if I'd buy another Water Wiggle since I'm not the one who bought the departed one in the first place. One must really love birds and backyard birding to spend such a hefty amount for this birdbath accessory. The West Nile Virus angle seems a bit far-fetched to me. I suppose in a small way one water wiggler in our backyard birdbath can reduce the potential spread of west Nile by an infinitesimal amount. Not providing any birdbaths at all would be just as effective, if not more so. All the birdbaths in the world combined are just a small percentage of the available breeding pools for mosquitoes.The wiggler's batteries are long lasting, and the rippling rings do seem to attract birds. The presence of constantly agitated water does seem to diminish the amount of yuck (technical term) growing on the birdbath's surface. But I'm still on the fence with this one, wiggling and waggling with my opinion. If you think the stated benefits are worth the price, then get yourself a Water Wiggler. Comments about the Water Wiggler on other consumer sites are mostly positive.
B0007CY2YQ Fiskars is a respected brand and I'd buy from them again, just not this particular pruner. The sliding lock mechanism is easy to operate and the pruners have a good spring to them.When I first got this pruner, it worked great. The cuts were clean and straight. After about three weekends of pruning (mostly rose bushes), the blades started dulling and no longer cut cleanly every time. Softer plant parts like dahlias flower stalks get squished and caught between the blades, causing them to stick together and not spring back open. This can leave a messy cut with jagged ends of plant tissue and cambium exposed, especially with stems that have soft, fibrous outer layers of bark, like green rose branches. For woodier cuts like camellia, it is still fine.Sometimes holding the pruners upside-down from the orientation pictured in the product photo helps deliver a clean cut. So, I rate this pair of pruners only average, because it has the same problem as my previous pruner with squishing stems.
B0007CY2YQ I use these pruners to cut flowers and bring them into my house. They are sharp and can cut through rose and peaony stems very easily. The size of the pruners make them easy to carry around in my back pocket and compete other yard work before getting the flowers. They are worth the money.
B0007CY2YQ Does snip well but parts are plastic thus do not feel it will last a long time, It is a good prunner for rose bushes etc,m and for the price a good item
B0007CY2YQ If you have rose bushes, the Fiskars Pruner is a must have. I love fresh roses in the house but hate those pesky thorns and always had a heck of a time removing them. With the Fiskars Pruner, I was able to remove all thorns rather quickly (it only took one or two times to get it down) and found the pruners to fit really well in my hand, eliminating any hand discomfort.  The blade is sharp and shows no sign of rust after using them for a season. This is a really useful tool and I absolutely would recommend others to purchase!
B0007CY2YQ These were not as sharp as I had hoped.  They are better for indoor pruning or light outdoor pruning.
B0007CY2YQ These pruners worked great on my rose bushes. I love to bring in fresh flowers and the thorn stripper was perfect. I was able to ensure I did not prick myself at all. The blades are super sharp, and I appreciate the handles being a reasonable size. They were very comfortable to for long use.
B0007CY2YQ This little hand held Fiskar's trimmer is perfect for cutting flowers to bring inside for a floral arrangement.  It worked nicely to trim up my rose bushes as well. Fiskar's really makes good quality hand held trimmers.
B0007LDXLA Purchased this snow removal tool for my wife, who uses her car on a daily basis for work.  While the car trunk is already filled with an assortment of semi-helpful gadgets, assuring her safety on the road, the Sno Brum is unquestionably in the top 5.  The tool is simple, effective, and does &#8220;what it says it does&#8221; easily. The tool doesn&#8217;t scratch the car body, is lightweight, and yet durable.  Don&#8217;t hit the snowy roads this winter without it!  All the more in Connecticut, a state in which a regulation will go into effect whereby cars may be fined up to $1000 for excess snow and ice flying off.
B0007LDXLA The Sno Brum works beautifully in plain, regular snow.  It has a large foam &#34;pusher&#34; that pushes show from the windows and surface of the car without stratching the surface of the car.  It is fabulous.  It can handle anything from a light dusting to several inches of snow (anything deeper needs to be done in layers or shifts), and makes it fairly painless to clear the car.However...  it is not perfect.  It doesn't work well in two different situations.1) The Sno Brum will not work well in any snow that has even a small amount of ice and/or freezing rain mixed in.  It can't deal with ice at all.  To be fair, other snow brooms can't handle ice, either.2) The Sno Brum doesn't work well against any irregularities in elevation on the surface of the car.  For example, it doesn't do well against the windshield wipers, against moon and/or sun roofs, etc.Overall, I am quite pleased with the Sno Brum and would recommend it for most winter weather situations.
B0007LDXLA I was never able to get this to extend and that was a real pain, especially since I bought it for my wife, who is short and catch reach the top of the van. Also, don't mistake this for an ice scraper; it has rounded edges meant to remove snow without scratching the roof of your vehicle.
B0007LDXLA Huge help moving snow off the top of my SUV. This makes snow very easy to remove even off of tall roofs. Takes just seconds to clear roof. It does not scratch the car.
B0007LDXLA Construction seems a bit flimsy but it works and I havent had any problems with it.  Its great for clearing snow off cars; especially large SUVs.
B0007LDXLA How could I have missed this before? The Sno Brum makes snow removal so much easier and faster.  Best of all, IT WON'T SCRATCH YOUR CAR!  GREAT PRODUCT!
B0007LDXLA This is as good as advertised for a car and I've used it for that and will keep it in the car.  But for me the good news is the threads in the snow brum head and handle are the same as with household poles for extending roller brushes or attaching mops.  I really wanted the snow brum to clear the snow off a large hot tub cover and was able to quickly attach the heat to a 10' extension pole.  The handle that comes with it won't quite reach all the way across the cover.
B0007LQ3RQ it is working as advertised to keep the squirrels away.  they've jumped on it only to see the doors close.  so far though I haven't found the answer to keep the sparrows off of it and that seems to keep the cardinals from using the ring.  they come to the area but limit so far themselves to the seeds that have fallen to the ground.
B0007LQ3RQ the birds love it!  got this for my husband to watch the cardinals and after just a few weeks we have to refill...and none of it because of squirrells.  it's a nice size so we don't have to change it every day.
B0007LQ3RQ So far my squirrels haven't penetrated or figured out how to get to the seed.  My two racoons decided to unhook it out of frustration and try and dig the seed out on the ground but I saved it and hung it up again and so far nobody has bothered it and the birds love it.  Very durable easy to fill and hang and holds quite a bit of seed.
B0007LQ3RQ We are enjoying this feeder so much!  the squirrell free mechanism works great and the adjustment allows us to cut off larger undesireable birds as well as squirrels.  we especially get a kick out of watching squirrells trying to access the food.!  It is also very easy to refill and we have not had any issues with the feed getting wet or clumpy.  Well worh the extra money!
B0007LQ3RQ Cardinals can get seeds, squirrels can't. Well made and relatively solid. Not really easy to clean, but not unexpected with weight-triggered closure device. Recommended as an affordable squirrel proof.UPDATE:  I can report that this feeder is actually bear-proof!  Well, almost.  It survived a bear's attempt to get through the plastic sleeve.  It was a little hard on the spring mechanism, but the bear didn't get any of the seed!
B0007LQ3RQ This feeder works so well, I brought a second.  I have alot of squirrels and most have given up.  I must confess a couple have leaped from the pole to the perch, but it closed and they gave up. They try to come off the top and try to chew on it, since it have a metal top, again they given up or fall off trying to stretch to the feeder opening.  This feeder is about squirrel free as possible.  I have loads of cardinals, finches,titmouse, woodpecker and no problems landing on it. It is expensive, I have seen ones in Wildbirds Unlimited for $100.  Worth the money.
B0007LQ3RQ This is a big feeder so refilling is minimized.  While little birds can enjoy several models, medium sized birds need the extra perch space this feeder provides. For whatever reasons, the Indigo Buntings prefer this feeder even though they're small and the Rose-Breasted Grosbeaks don't fit on the small perches of my other feeders so this is the only one they come to.  The little birds use it as well as the others.Squirrels, of course, can't get any food from it, although they can get the ring off sometimes.  There's nothing else for them to get a grip on although they have tried, but apparently the word went out, because they don't come around anymore.  I've got the ring on there pretty tight at this point.  There are easy directions if you have to replace it or tighten it.The feeder is also guaranteed forever so if the ring gets lost for any reason, it will be replaced free.  You don't actually need the ring, as there are perches around the bottom with access to the seed openings and not using it even further deters squirrels, but my birds seem to like it.  Even though the Grosbeaks are only in my area for a short time, they are so pretty, I'm eager to provide an environment that attracts them.The large tube of this feeder makes it easier to fill than other tube feeders and it's easy to hang high as it has a rigid hanger that allows you to hold it over your head to reattach on a tall pole.  It is a durable feeder and popular with the birds because they can still feed in large numbers even when the feeder is almost empty since all the feedholes are around the bottom.  A great squirrel proof feeder.  Highly recommended.
B0007LQ3RQ First of all, this feeder does not come with a hook, so if you plan to hang it in a tree, like I did, you'll need to order a metal extension hook unless you plan to mess with rope. I really like the hook I bought: Panacea 89017 Tree Branch Hook, Black, 36-Inch. The hook is almost the same length as the feeder, so they ship together nicely in the same Amazon box if you order them together. Within 48 hours of installing the feeder, I caught my 3 resident squirrels sliding down the hook from the tree onto the feeder and attempting to chew the seed holes on the feeder to access the seed. However, it was pure entertainment for me because 90% of the time the squirrels cannot maintain their balance on the tiny feeder roof and simply slip off 4' to the cushioned ground below (below pine tree, so lots of soft dry needles). In snow, they simply cannot hang on and slip right off. For a week the squirrels attempted to jump at the feeder or climb down the hook, and they finally seem to have given up and now simply feed off the fallen seed on the ground. I am delighted that so many bird species are using the feeding in the first 2 weeks: cardinals, house finches, mourning doves (feed on seed on ground), woodpecker, titmouse, nut hatch, chickadee, etc. Recently, it poured and hailed/sleeted at all angles, so I decided to buy a large, clear plastic baffle to provide added coverage from the weather: Aspects 182 Super Dome. It was a steep $40 (other reviews suggested a $8-10 one sold at most feed supply stores), but I wish I had bought it from day 1 because it would have kept the squirrels off the feeder completely. I like that it is clear and reviews said it lasts over time (it is also made in the USA). I did examine the feeder after 3 weeks of use now and the squirrels managed to scratch and chew the feeder in certain spots, which can be completely eliminated by buying the aforementioned baffle. The squirrels now have no way to surpass the baffle. You could obviously probably buy any feeder and use the baffle to prevent squirrel access...We have a lot of cardinals in our area, so I attached the cardinal ring from day 1 and extended all of the metal perches directly into the ring by twisting them at even intervals so that they full screw into every hole of the 'ring'. Another review mentioned birds getting stuck if you don't extend the perches fully into the ring. I find that the cardinals love the feeder, but they also like to just feed off the fallen seed 50% of the time, as they appear to prefer ground feeding for ease of watching for predators...The ring just gives the feeder a 360 degree perch, so most of the birds hop around the ring and explore the seed in each door. If they see me at the window and are shy, they also hop to a door of the feeder where they are more hidden.As for seed, I bought (on Amazon) the Kaytee Cardinal Blend, 7-Pound Bag and Kaytee Waste Free Nut and Fruit Blend, 5.5-Pound Bag. I created a large paper funnel with poster board I have, and scooped in 1 cup of one bag and 1 cup of the other bag to have even intervals of different seed. Even the chickadees and smaller birds love the larger nuts and seeds (I don't use any millet). They fly to the feeder and quickly grab 1 sunflower seed, then fly to a nearby pine street branch and peck away at it to break it open. Kaytee seemed to be one of the only seed brands that didn't have complaints from consumers about twigs and other waste. I do find it to be 100% seed. I also occasionally mix in some of my organic breakfast cereal, such as granola with chia seeds, which they love as something different.My final thought is that given how quickly the squirrels tried to get to the feeder and seed, I can't imagine using any other feeder.  The seed would surely be dumped in 1-2 days unless it were hung in a location where squirrels have no access. You really must buy this feeder if you plan to use the feeder in an area where you have squirrels. Other reviews stated that raccoons and deer can feed easily, so if you live in those areas, you might consider hanging it higher...If you're on a budget and can't afford this feeder, at least buy the baffle I recommend, which seems to be curved enough to prevent any squirrel from reaching any feeder you use below it.All in all, I spent almost $200 on the feeder, hook, clear baffle/dome, and quality nut/fruit/sunflower seed, but it was like a Disney movie today with over 15 birds and squirrels in my yard at the same time happily feeding at the feeder and on the ground.Other fun accessories to build your backyard avian habitat (see my other reviews):-->ceramic pedestal bird bath-->wood blue bird houseUPDATE: Have had the feeder for about 3 months and have many regular birds (many mated pairs) that come daily at regular intervals:1 cardinal pair1 chickadee pair1 titmouse pair1 gold finch pair3-4 mourning dove pairs (that feed below it and then sun themselves nearby)1 territorial catbird pair (they chase away all other small birds when feeding)6 regular house sparrows and their chicks2-4 song sparrows2-4 red-headed house finches that travel together1 agile-flying nuthatcher (swoops in, grabs a nut, flies off)1-2 grackles with a voracious appetite4 different woodpecker species (Northern Flicker, Hairy Woodpecker, Red-bellied Woodpecker, Downy Woodpecker)1 occasional ground-feeding cowbird pair (male with brown head)1 shy house wren pair (they mostly look for insects in the vicinity, and only occasionally use the feeder)1 inquisitive blue jay (doesn't feed from feeder, but watches it, and feeds off ground nearby)3-5 squirrels that feed on the groundThey all recognize me when I glance out the window and throw them fruit and large nut pieces...Also, the catbirds and grackles are VERY smart. They realized that if they both use the perch, the seed hatches are closed, so they only feed 1 at a time and get impatient while 1 feeds and the other waits nearby! I have so many birds frequenting the feeder that the feed level drops 1-2 inches per day. I did adjust the tension level of the perch to have it close with less weight, but it was sad to see the birds fighting so much because when 3 sparrows or finches landed, the doors closed and they got aggressive. I also saw the heavier woodpecker really stressing over trying to pry a nut out with the doors 95% closed...I decided to just recalibrate it and allow full access for all birds...it just means some will gorge and I'll go through more seed....I find that some species tend to wildly peck at the seed to get to their favorite morsels, so the happy mourning doves wait below for the shower of seed that falls...
B0007LQ3RQ This tubular feeds work exactly as advertised; the seed doors shut whenever the weight on the perch gets too much, so as soon as a squirrel puts his weight on it or a large bird tries to land, they are denied food.  The spring-loaded green base simply lowers over the holes.  So far, squirrels have been discouraged, and they haven't managed to chew through the feeder as they did to a cedar and plastic one I once had.The top comes off easily with a twist.  Filling can be a two-person job because it isn't easy to keep the tube upright if you need two hands to lift a large bag a seed.  I suggest getting a bird seed scoop, especially since you'll also have less spillage.  The birds, including cardinals, actually seem to prefer this feeder over a nearby hopper-type one.UPDATE, with an LOL:  Well, the squirrels have figured out that if they stick their paws inside the holes, they can keep the doors from shutting.  As long as they don't put their full weight on the feeder (they use the nearby hopper feeder to plant their hind legs), they can get food out, bit by bit.  I recommend keeping this feeder away from anything where they can balance and then stretch over to the tube.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann
B0007LQ3RQ The best squirrel proof feeder out!  We purchase our first one in 2007 and recently the perches came loose and we lost them - a simple call and email to the company brought us a new set in just a few days.  Great support!  Feeder is easy to load and easy to use and works great.  When we lost the perches we purchased a new one and then got the parts for the old one - now we use two and they are wonderful - expensive but well built, last a long time and company stands behind them.  Worth every penny!
B0007LQ3RQ As a Christmas gift to a friend, I am helping her feed the birds.  She is confined to a wheelchair so watching the birds gives her and her cats a lot of pleasure.  We wanted to draw an assortment of birds, not just sparrows.  This feeder is drawing tit mice, gold finches and a few cardinals but not sparrows.  The squirrels have continued to be thwarted by it and it holds enough feed that I think I can fill it once a week.  We are very pleased with it!
