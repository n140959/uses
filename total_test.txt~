000N5WPQY We have had this tiler for a few years now and since we were moving, just stored it until we were moved.  So, moving aside, we drug this thing out and guess what? It worked for a little bit then quit.  It wouldn't restart, and then the motor started smoking!  What a ridiculous machine!  SO wish I would have saved the money on this thing and bought the other tiller that's the Number 1 seller on amazon.  This thing is a total piece of junk!  And, I'm now out the $330 I paid for it.  Brother!
B000N5WPQY Yes, I use my Mantis tiller every day to loosen up my horse stalls.  Not typical use for a device like this, but it works fantastic.My horse stalls have a sand base, and running the tiller over them every day keeps the sand loose and the stalls fresh. I've been using this tiller in my stalls for several months now, and it's running like a champ. It gets the job done done quickly and better than I could do with a rake.
B000NCTGQE I bought this greenhouse to over-winter some not cold-hardy plants on my screened porch. It was easy to set up, although I managed to get the side supports upside down, once that was corrected, the finished product looked very nice. The shelves are rather flimsy but hold my plants with no problem. Even though the weather has only been cold enough lately to use the greenhouse a couple of nights, when I took the ferns out during the day I noticed how nice and warm it was inside. For my purpose the greenhouse works very well, the cover is fairly heavy, it fits good, the tubing feels strong and the pieces all fit together. I'm very happy with the greenhouse.
B000NCTGQE I use 2 of these with row cover cloth over them to shade my heat sensitive plants in the summer.  It's much more sturdy than I was led to believe by some of the other reviews.  We have pretty strong winds around here, and it doesn't phase it.  Granted I don't use the plastic covering.
B000NCTGQE I have one tomato plant and I use this mini greenhouse to keep it warm at night. ( I do not use the shelves)It has worked wellThe only issue is this.  During the day it gets too hot.  I would love to find a mini greenhouse like this with an automatic venting system. So if it gets too hot, the vent/fan turns on to remove hot airThe do have these types if venting systems for larger greenhouses so it can be done.
B000NCTGQE My husband put this shelving unit together in 20 minutes.  He added tie-ons around each tier shelf to keep them from moving around too much.  It's a handsome little thing but I can tell just by looking at it that it is not designed for long-term outdoor use.  Those reviewers who complain that it gets blown away in the wind are not using this for its intended use.  The intended use is as an indoor growing medium with supplemental light.  A heated garage, a sheltered patio or balcony or a sunny spot in a large kitchen would be ideal for this greenhouse and users could get many years of use from this thing.The connecting parts are plastic and when empty this greenhouse does not weight much (thus its \"portability\").  The lower end is open to air, so true humidity would be difficult to replicate.The \"plastic smell\" goes away when left out to ventilate a few days after set-up.I am happy with this little device.  Here in Arizona this covered shelving unit works to keep dust from getting on my garden tools in the off season.  In the dry, windy springs here, though, this thing wouldn't stand a chance of lasting long outdoors in the direct sun.
B000NCTGQE Although the construction of this \"greenhouse\" is somewhat flimsy, with 1/2\" metal tubular supports and wire shelves, it works well as a temporary shelter/space for plants, as long as you don't expect to keep plants warm during frosty nights.  I use mine indoors during the end of winter for starting seeds, then move it outside as the weather gets better.This shelving unit comes with a plastic tent with a zippered door that fits over the frame; the door can be rolled up to cool the interior or to access the plants.  Because the tent is relatively thin plastic (think suit-bag on steroids) and not glass, it heats up in the sunlight but immediately loses its heat as the sun sets, unlike greenhouses that are flush to the ground and have thicker glass/plastic walls to retain the heat longer.  If you still have temperatures in the thirties or forties at night and expect to grow warm weather plants like tomatoes outside, use plant heating pads or keep the unit inside until you can be sure that the cold nights won't stunt the plants.  If you do get an unexpected light frost, however, the plastic works like a row cover, keeping frost from the leaves.  If using outside, place it in a protected spot or anchor it in some fashion -- preferably both.  Even loaded with plants, the unit can blow over, especially with the tent in place since it can act like a sail.With the plastic in place, the top shelf is difficult to access, particularly toward the back because rolled-up the tent door and overhang get in the way.  The other three shelves (12-13\" between each) have plenty of clearance, and all four have room for 2-3 large seed trays.  Grow lights (not included) can be attached without much effort, provided, of course, that they are the right size.  The wire shelves are not attached to the frame - they sit on top of the cross-supports - but will stay in place during light winds as long as plants are on them.As long as you don't expect heavy-duty construction and heat retainment for cold nights, this shelving unit should serve well for seed starting or even for a display of small plants.  I don't find it attractive enough for a permanent plant stand for inside the house, but luckily it's lightweight enough to easily move around and store.  I find this perfect for starting my garden indoors and then using it to harden off my plants.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann
B000NCTGQE I already have a couple of these that I've been using for years.  The units hold up well, but the covers don't hold up as long.  I don't use them to start my plants in.  I do that inside with heated mats and overhead lighting that can be adjusted.  I use these racks to harden off my seedlings prior to planting or hold plants I've purchased until planting time.  If you start your own tomato, pepper and other plants from seed, they can gradually acclimate to living outdoors using these handy racks.Only the top shelves will accomdate taller plants, but my seedlings are planted in the garden before they get too tall.  Sometimes I've needed the height if I purchased plants that were already quite tall.Most of my vegetable gardening is done in earthboxes.  We have a serious squirrel and slightly lessor rabbit problem in our area.  The squirrels will continually dig whereever I've planted things and the birds will quickly grab any seeds that are exposed.They destroyed all of the snap peas I planted a couple of weeks ago.  Only one seedling survived their havoc.  The other day I discovered that the shelves from these racks fit nicely over an earthbox.  The mesh openings are small enough to keep the squirrels and birds from digging up the seeds before they germinate.  I simply laid the mesh shelf over the top of the earthbox and secured it into place.  The soil level is a couple of inches lower and the seedlings can either grow through the mesh or I can simply remove the shelf once they've established themselves.I am considering buying another unit just for the mesh shelves.  I direct seed things like cucumbers, beans, peas, radishes and squash in the earthboxes and often have to plant multiple times before I have enough growing.  These shelves should solve that problem.For hardening off seedlings, I only close the covers if we expect a cool night and my racks are used on a covered front porch and against the back of the house.  I position them so they are less susceptable to wind to help sheild the plants from cold wind and keep them from blowing over.  After a brief period, I bring the plants out of the unit for gradually increasing lengths of time so they get a little wind and the stems get sturdy.  You do need to shift the plants because they will always grow toward the light and they need fresh air and wind to become strong enough to survive in the garden.Those who have had trouble with plants wilting due to too much moisture need to give the plants more access to fresh air and air circulation.  Just remove the cover when the temps allow it or remove the trays of plants for a few hours a day.
B000NCTGQE You probably need to make a few adjustments.  Firstly, the wire shelving does not snap into place so sliding a tray on the wire shelf would cause the entire shelf to fall off the railing.  I used locking ties to affix the shelves to the rail apparatus to prevent the shelves from sliding off. Also,  I would prefer the zipper to go both from top and bottom rather than just he bottom. If you have to water on the top shelf, you have to unzip the entire thing.  But good anyway.
B000NCTGQE We purchased two of these. We were excited to get them quickly and we put them together with no problems. We knew they weren't going to be the highest quality, but we thought they would do the job. We put a total of 6 small plants (herbs and vegetable seedlings) split between the 2 greenhouses. We also put things like our small shovel, empty watering can, and bag of soil on the bottom shelves. There is no recommended maximum weight listed on the product listing, the box, or the directions. We figured we should be okay since we had much less than what is pictured on the box and also on the product listing here.Not even 24 hours after setting these up both crashed to the ground. Pots broke, plants were tossed upside down, and everything was a mess. It was difficult to get everything out safely since the plastic was zipped up and the opening was facing the ground. Once we got everything out, we noticed the plastic supports on both of our greenhouses broke. They could not hold the weight. That is unfortunate considering there wasn't that much sitting in the greenhouse to begin with.We will definitely be returning both of these.I wouldn't bother wasting your money on this. We've decided to spend a little more and get a heavy duty rack like this one:Seville Classics SHE18487 18-Inch by 48-Inch by 72-Inch Shelving System with Wheels, Chromeand then wrap heavy duty plastic around the back and sides. For the front, we are going to attach a second piece of plastic with velcro so it is removable. Same effect, but at least we can be certain it won't come crashing down.--In case this review doesn't scare you away and you are still curious about the dimensions between the shelves:-There is 12.5\" between each shelf.-The top shelf has 20.5\" of space at it's highest point.If you are having trouble keeping the wire shelves flat across the supports, you can bend them slightly downward so they fit better. This stopped ours from moving around so much....well before they came crashing down. :/
B000NCTGQE I used this greenhouse this spring.  We had a long wet/ cold spring this year.  I was happy to have somewhere for my seedlings but there are several things I do not like about this product and I do not plan to buy another.Pros -*Works well to protect seedlings from wind and excess rain if monitored*Easy to assemble*Inexpensive*Nice lookingCons -*Forget using the wheels unless your surface is smooth.  My older deck was too rough and the tiny wheels kept getting stuck*Easy assembly yes, but also easy disassembly.  Every time you move the thing it falls apart no matter how well you think you have forced the pieces together.  I also had to use some electrical tape to tape the shelves in place as they just sit on the rails and will fall off, damaging plants below.*With no vents it can go from warm to plant killing heat in just a few minutes if the sun comes out unexpectedly.  I used a wireless thermometer to monitor it constantly.  I finally cut a 6 x 8\" vent on either side of the top where the heat built up the most.  I left the flaps hanging and tucked them up when it was warm.*If it is really cold the plants have to be brought into the house.  This unit is so small and the plastic doesn't go all the way to the ground there is no way it will actually hold heat overnight, something owners of even larger 'real' greenhouses struggle to do.In summary - I previously had an 8 x 10 actual greenhouse but have recently moved and needed something cheap and quick.  This fit the bill. After using it for 3 months the plastic around the zippers is starting to come loose.  I monitored it continuesly as to the temperature, opening and closing the front flap and my home made vents as needed.  Everytime I left the house for an extended period I had to decide if I wanted to just put the plants out on the table and risk cold damage or leave them in the greenhouse and risk heat damage.  This is a useful item but is very time consuming to make the best use of.  The quality is ok.  Originally I was planning to break it down for easy storage in the summer but now I think I will permenently glue the joints and store it fully assembled so it isn't falling apart on me.  Either way in one more season I am sure it will be shot and then I plan to purchase another 'real' greenhouse or use high tunnels.
B000NCTGQE I don't know what the negative posters are talking about.  It took me 5 minutes to assemble this greenhouse and place it on my pool patio.  I've started two generations of seeds in this greenhouse without any problems.  The shelving is metal, the frame is heavy duty plastic with metal parts, and the cover fits perfectly.  It is a very lightweight unit so I wouldn't recommend putting it in an area where you'd be encountering wind gusts since it might tip over.  However, that's just common sense, or so I thought until I read the reviews here.Good product, decent prices, easy assembly, 5 stars.... and I just purchased another right before leaving this review.
B000NCTGQE There's frost danger in our mountains until mid-May. We're at 5,500 feet, and it gets hot in summer (up to 100F), but the growing season isn't that long. If you want tomatoes and more that will finish producing before the temp. plunges below freezing again, you either pay for plants a couple of feet tall - or you grow your own from seed.We've begun to grow both veggies and flowers from seed, and we've set up a \"sprouting station\" with a heated warming pad under a fluorescent grown light (I've reviewed them separately). We use Jiffy trays of 72 peat pellets each, that come with their own tray and see-through plastic top. But what would we do would we do with those flats of pretty green heads once up?The answer was this greenhouse. We set it up indoors, in front of the fixed section of a sliding glass door. Some daylight gets to it, but it needed more light, so I rigged it with 2ft. fluorescent \"under-counter\" lights, purchased elsewhere. That doubled the cost, but it made the unit self sufficient.Overall, the shelving unit is a little lightweight - but then again, it had to be designed to ship in a box for a reasonable cost. Once here, it was easy to figure out and put together - took maybe twenty minutes tops. The greenhouse is 2'3\" wide by 1'7\" deep. It's just over 5' high. That sounds pretty small, but in fact, it holds a lot. We've got basil, parsley, cilantro and more growing, and the greenhouse holds eight herb-size pots to a shelf. Or you can (just) fit two Jiffy 72-pellet trays on one shelf.The shelves themselves are wire mesh, and not fixed down, so I used plastic zip-ties to hold them in place.The clear plastic cover is pretty easy to slip over the unit, and the 2 x zippers are decent quality.I held back 1 star for these reasons: while most of the structure is metal rods, the end pieces are molded plastic. With our herb pots on the shelves, they bow a little in the middle. I'll probably end up cutting dowel to shore up each shelf. The manufacturer should think about beefing up those end pieces.Also, some worker half way around the world must have had a bad day while sewing our slip-over plastic cover - the seam on the front is crooked. Not bad enough for us to return it, but that's what we see every time we look at it. The clear plastic (or vinyl?) cover itself could have also been a heavier material.Those are quibbles. Overall, this greenhouse priced under $50 is one of the most reasonable out there. It is what it claims to be - a cute, tight unit.Recommended.
B000NCTGQE I bought this thinking it would be kind of cool to grow some smaller plants and flowers on but was disappointed... Though it it was easy to assemble.For outside use-  Without a sturdy background AND screwing it in for support this greenhouse design will fall over with even the smallest gusts of wind destroying all your plants... yes it happened to me, but i was able to salvage and retransfer a few of my starts.-During the summer months if you keep the flap closed the plants will not get nearly enough oxygen and die.  Also, in summer even with flap open I recorded heat in excess of 110degF causing serious wilting.For inside use-  Pretty much can only be used as a display for small flowers or to start plants in a tray (seed dome only fits in top tier) but kind of looks like crap with any kind furniture you might put in a room.All in all- Not a good buy unless you want a slightly hideous plant display or just want to look like you grow plants in a &#34;greenhouse&#34;.
B000NCUW1M I've used this stuff for years.  You have to be patient with it, as unnerving as it can be to watch the little critters march across your floors/counters.  How long it takes all depends on the size of the colony I assume.  The problem at my previous residence took almost 2 weeks to clear up (They seriously slowed down after the first few days).  The ants at my current one took &#60;3 days.  I don't use the &#34;spots&#34; they provide.  I use a larger piece of cardboard and put individual drops all over it.  You want the most &#34;edge&#34; area for the ants to feed from, so one big pool doesn't work.  Check your spots often to make sure they don't eat it all and wander off to find alternate food...make sure you keep it like a buffet, always full!  Although you don't want anyone to ingest it, as far as poisons go....I feel fairly comfortable having it around.
B000NCUW1M Every few years we get invaded on our hill top by tiny ants. All the neighbors tried different things and it didn't stop it. Then one got terro several years ago and bam. So we all now use it. This year, lots of rain and sure enough, they are back. Used it for a week and no more ants. I have even used in my car when they invade the car. I put it in tiny plastic lids instead of on the tear off paper (not such a good idea but product so great, won't remove a star.. just save flatter type lids).
B000NCUW1M We had little Pharaoh ants in our RV.  I tried other baits and few home made ant killers.  These little Pharaoh ants had a picnic.  I bought this Terro and the party was over!  The ants formed a heavy line and in a day or two they were gone!  Be sure and keep them supplied with bait until they stop coming.Recommended!
B000NCUW1M Been using this for years and it is great stuff. Only issue is it dries up in a couple of days so you need to refresh the area.
B000NCUW1M Here we are in the middle of a major drought in Indiana and the only thing that is multiplying is the ants!  They are just thriving in the heat and they are everywhere.  If I set out food for the other animals the ants are all over it in minutes and they devour everything.  This product is a sure thing, it doesn't kill the ants in your home, it kills the nest and it is gone.I was unfamiliar with this product a few years ago and now I use it every year.  We found a few ants in our kitchen and they were so small that they were crawling under the door seal.  I got some Terro liquid and put a small drop on a few pieces of thin cardboard and placed them in the path of the incoming ants.  They immediately found it and within a few minutes hundreds of them were enjoying the bait.  They eat their fill and then take some back to share with the colony.  They even share it with the Queen (Which is really your target) and within a few days to a few weeks the colony is gone (Depending on its size).  The ants that eat it die within 24 to 48 hours and they are sharing it with other ants.  Don't disturb the bait and only replenish it if it becomes hard or they have consumed it all.  Just add a few drops and in hot weather, do this in the morning and at night.  The ants that find the bait leave an odor trail and this leads the other ants to the bait so don't move the bait.Terro also makes liquid ant bait traps that are prefilled and ready to use.  They feed the ants but protect the bait from the elements and it prevents the bait from drying out.  Leave the Terro in place for 3 or 4 days so you don't see any more ants and then you can dispose of it.  Terro is safe to use around pets and children and its active ingredient is Borax which is already used in many household products.This product works and it does its job quickly and safely.  It works both inside and outside and within 4 days you should begin to see the difference.  I believe in this product and I strongly recommend it to you!
B000NCUW1M I'm so happy they just sell the liquid.  Their ant killer is the best but I had switched to Combat's gel (in the syringe-looking thing) because the little bait stations Terro usually has available are dumb.  Ants NEVER go in them.  I have always just dumped the liquid out of them and threw out the plastic station.  Now I don't have to bother with that and I can put this anywhere!  I will say that this is a liquid and will run if you use it vertically.  The Combat gel can go on a wall without issue.
B000NCUW1M This is the most amazing product that I have used.  I put in it two areas where I either knew or suspected that there were ants inside my house.  Within 15-20 minutes, there were hundreds of them in a feeding frenzy.  The secret is to resist the temptation to spray them, since they eventually head back to the nest where apparently they infect others and where they all die.  So far, it has taken a little less than 3 days for the hundreds to drop down to a handful. Some didn't make it back to the nest. This is clearly a very effective product. You can get it for $2 and change at your local hardware store.
B000NCUW1M Living in New Mexico, we have lots of ants. We have used Terro for years now. We use it where ants are active and always put it on the floor. Don't put it on your counters. Perhaps we have many ants because last year we went through FOUR bottles of Terro and still had ants. It at least keeps them busy and in one place. They are very attracted to this formula. Whether or not it has been taken back to the nest and killed off any colonies, I don't know. I found that the traps sometimes will dry up before the ants can empty them, so I prefer the bottled liquid so it can be doled out as needed.
B000NCUW1M I can't tell but it does not seem to kill them.,...they swarm to eat it but they keep coming back !!
B000NCUW1M When I see ants swarming in the house, my natural reaction is to spray them with a diluted soap solution, which kills them almost immediately.Using a product like Terro Liquid Ant Killer, requires suppressing my \"kill immediately\" mindset and taking a long term approach.  The very best case scenario is that the foraging worker ants will consume the ant killer, and take it back to the colony, where it is consumed by the Queen ant.  When she dies, the colony will become crippled and die out.It sounds great in theory, and every species of ant I have encountered seems to love drinking this liquid.  It's very cool watching the ants maniacally feed, but how likely is it really that the poisonous solution will find its way back to her royal highness?  Probably, very, very, low.Many ant colonies are quite intensive, span large areas, can contain millions of ants, and some even have several queens.  Believing that the few ants consuming the poison, will fortuitously also feed and kill the Queen, is quite a long shot.  Logically the more ants that drink the poison, the greater the odds of success.  So infecting as many ants as possible makes sense, however that is a little challenging when the product is being sold in one or two ounce bottles, and administered by the drop.  It just doesn't seem very efficient, or provide the necessary coverage to poison enough ants.I live in a temperate part of the country, and have four or five different species of ants constantly battling for territory in my yard.  They are basically everywhere there is soil.  Having used this product and similar liquid ant baits, many, many times, I have yet to see it successfully wipe out a colony.The ingredients listed on the label are \"Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate (Borax) 5.4%\", and \"Other Ingredients: 94.6%\".  Assuming the costs are nominal for these ingredients, the percentage of profit on a product like this must be astronomical.  If liquid ant killer was sold by the pint instead of by the ounce, at a price closer to actual costs, with a more efficient system of distributing the poison (traps or other dispensers), I suspect the product would have a much higher rate of success.  But of course, that would be financial suicide for Terro, who make no promises regarding success.  Consider this, at the retail cost of $6.50 for two ounces, Terro Ant Killer costs about $416 per gallon (128 ounces).  At the price for the one ounce bottle ($4.27), a gallon costs $544.  This stuff is not cheap!I use the product occasionally, with the hope that maybe just once I will get lucky and wipe out a colony.  Seeing the ants literally crawl over each other to guzzle down the stuff, feeds my fantasy that this will be the time the deadly elixir makes its way down through the depths of the colony, to the Queen's lips (sorry, mandibles), and she will meet a tragic end.  No luck so far.Ant bait does work, however what appears to be missing is some honest, accurate data about how much liquid, and how many ants may need to be poisoned, to stand a good chance of taking out a colony.  If as I suspect, both numbers are quite substantial, that information probably won't be forthcoming from Terro anytime soon.
B000NCWOKE I purchased this hose because I wanted a lightweight weigh hose I could maneuver around.  I also was more interested in pressure than volume.  I have been very pleased.  The hose is kink resistant and solidly built.  I highly recomend.
B000NCWOKE I have purchased four of these Gilmour 10 series hoses over the last three years, two are still working. The manufacturer specifies a lifetime warranty on their web page, but no-one from the company has ever replied to my emails. We have 3 hoses in the back garden, the third is a Flexon, which so far has outlasted two of the more expensive Gilmours, and it's a lot lighter.
B000NCWOKE I love this hose.  It replaced my HEAVY one inch hose that was hard to pull through my long yard.  This one is a joy to use, so easy to maneuver.  Will purchase again if necessary.
B000NCWOKE I demand a lot out of my hoses, and in spring/summer have 2 100-foot hoses + 1 50-foot hose running from the house to our raised-bed vegetable garden.Well, I didn't even start the garden yet but had the hose fail on me. I left if on for a couple hours but had the nozzle off from the sprayer. The hoses I had last year never had an issue in this state.But after just two hours, the Flexogen hose was spraying water from the part that connects to the faucet. I'll be able to patch it and use it with our rain barrel but it disappointed me.
B000NCWOKE I went for this because of price. My mistake, it kinks and the kinks turn into squeezed shut areas that have to be worked back to open flo. Never will buy again.
B000NCWOKE Length and 8-ply construction of this rugged hose means that it will swerve you for many years. As such, it is a better investment than buying a 2-ply or 4-ply hose!  Length is ideal for use in any corner of my yard.  Couplings are tightly fastened.  Well-constructed!
B000NCWP44 Have really held up.  Much better than the washers I bought at the local hardware store, although you'd never know by looking at them.
B000NCWP44 What a difference a washer makes! It turned my leaky spitting garden hose into a well behaved no leak hose!  These washes are made from high quality rubber.  They are easy to install and fit the hose perfectly.  They are more expensive than the cheap washers that you can pick up at a home improvement store for a couple of bucks, but I think they will last longer and in the long run will not be more expensive. I have hard water and had to replace the flimsy washers every year.
B000NCWP44 Something that always gets lost and you need to have extras on hand when they get hard and useless. Or you risk getting very wet every time you hand water anything. A must have for homeowners with large yards
B000NCWP44 Must have washers for your hose and attachments as they all eventually begin to degrade.  Nice pack of seemingly quality washers for a good price.
B000NCWP44 These seem to work very well.  They are a lot snugger than the plastic(?) washer that came with my spray nozzle, and they have more depth and \"cushion\" than the old one.  I don't think I'll have any problem with leaks now.
B000NCWP44 What can I say, rubber hose washers, they work just fine.  This is hard to give rate reasons as they are just washers.
B000NCWP44 Came with 10 washers, at well less then 4 bucks its a great deal. I had a pack of these before that lasted about 6 years until I lost them, so I'm certain the rubber will stay good at least that long when stored. I've only used 2 of these but so far both the hoses don't have any leaks.
B000NCWP44 There seems to be a softer quality to this rubber that makes for a far superior seal with no leaks, as opposed to products that appear very similar but are harder and don't seal as well.
B000NCWP44 great deal stops leaking water hoses. very fast shipping. working great so far. great price. will order again when I need them. thanks.
B000NCWP44 I have been using Gilmore washers for quite some time now and of all the washers I've dealt with over the years this brand is consistently the best.  Now unlike some folks who have one or two hoses hooked up and connected, I have the things running all over the place.  We have a very large vegetable garden, a large number of flower gardens, orchard and grape vines.  We do A LOT of watering.Now some of our gardens, trees, etc. are located quite a distance from our various outlets.  Folks, we are talking four acres here with stuff that needs watering all over the place.  This requires multiple hose connections.  Now I have found that when I have a leak near the joint or main connection that in 99 percent of the time is requires a washer replacement.  The thing is, washers wear out, especially if you leave the hoses out year around like we do.  I make it a practice to replace all washers each spring.  This saves me a lot of frustration and hassle during the main growing portion of the year.Please note that if you run over the end of your hoses or hose joints with a car, tractor or lawn tractor, a washer will not normally fix the situation.  Nor, I fear to tell you, if you accidently burn your hose while burning leaves and brush, will a washer fix the problem...trust me...I know about stuff like that.The price here for a package of ten washers is quite competitive.  I pay more at local stores.  I will start ordering these things from Amazon as it will save me some bucks so I can replace burned hoses.Anyway, when you buy a new hose, check it out.  You will almost always find one of those little plastic washers either in the end or wired to the hose.  If you want my recommendation, you will get rid of the plastic washer and replace it with one of these Gilmores...you are going to have to do it anyway very soon so you might save yourself the headache.I always keep an extra pack or two of these around as I have little patients and when I need a washer, I need a washer now!This is a good buy and as a Prime member, I get free shipping which makes it even better!Don BlankenshipThe ozarks
B000NCWP44 I had the black washer in my garden hose and spray nozzle that came with them when purchased. They both leaked, so I purchased these red ones. They stopped both the leakes and I've not had any leaks from either one. I'm very satisfied, so far.
B000NCWP44 What can you say about them they do the job and must be used to keep your water where it needs to be and to keep you dry. theese are very good,thicker than others i have purchased I would recommend these!
B000NCWP44 I had no idea that the a good washer could make the difference.  They are very large and sturdy and actually fit our hose beautifully.  These are not the cheap, hard plastic washers you find other places.  These beauties really work and no more leaks.
B000NCWP44 Not much to comment on gaskets except that they serve there purpose in our garden hoses.  Somewhat larger than those you buy at a discount store.
B000NCWP44 These washers are an add-on item which means they ship free with a $25.00 order. There are 10 red washers in the plastic bag at a cost of $3.98 for the 10 of them. They are the exact size as the black washers that come with the Gilmour solid brass hose connectors that are known to cause cancer according to the state of California. These washers are made in China as are the Gilmour hose connectors for which I bought the washers. There is no cancer warning on the red washers. Replacing the washers is a very easy task. They do a good job of stopping leaks.
B000NCWP44 These washers are an excellent fit for my 5/8-inch hose ends. Old washers do tend to dry out regularly and the fact that Amazon carries these washers makes it much easier to replace them as needed.
B000NCWP44 bought these for my non heavy duty hoses that didn't have washers built in.these performed exactly as i wanted/expected.  leaks stopped, but functionality remained.perfect.
B000NCWP44 They seal just like they are supposed to and so far I haven't had any leaks. Right price, product as described.
B000NCWP44 You can't beat these red rubber washers. They seal so much better than the black O-Ring style. At least I have found them to be far superior.
B000NCWP44 Excellent hose washers, far superior to the cheap plastic &#34;washers&#34; found at box stores. I will definitely consider buying these again when the time comes (in a few years or so).
B000NCWP44 It is always good to have a couple of these as spares. They fit nice and snug in the hose that for the price I always replace them every other year or so.
B000NCWP44 Sometimes improvements don't have to be fancy & expensive - like these Gilmour washers.  Over the years it seems like every time I use my hose for something I end up wet in one manner or another.  All my hoses and connector nozzles have leaks at the connector point - if I'm lucky the leak sprays harmless away from me but alas about half the time I take one in the eye, pants, shoes, etc.  I still remember the time I got a good soaking in the upper front part of my pants right before company came over...I used to think the problem was in the nozzles so I would replace them more frequently than I probably should have (at $10+ per pop).  However, even the new nozzles leaked and sprayed me in the eyes/pants/shoes/etc.  Over the years it dawned on me (I'm not that bright) that it's  not the nozzle but probably just needs better washer sealing.  I knew what to do next  -> Amazon.com ->  search ->  garden washer ->  read user reviews ->  Gilmour Hose Washers.I'm glad to report that these washers work as advertised and can't beat the price (vs buying new nozzles).  No more leaks/soakings.  I've found I do need more washers than hoses - I insert mine in the nozzle heads and I've got more nozzles than hoses. 
B000NCWP44 I didn't intend to purchase these, but ended up buying them based on an amazon recommendation. I didn't realize how much I needed these and have been very satisfied stopping all leaks in my hoses and attachments.
B000NCWP44 This is a pretty handy pack of washers to have around, they are probably going to work better for you then any washer included in a new garden hose or garden sprayer.  Works even better if you put a thin layer of teflon-based lubricant on it like Magic Lube or something similar.  Prevents leaks.
B000NCWP44 I tried yellow plastic washers and a quick connect set purchased at Lowes, they didn't work. Despairing of finding a solution, I put this washer in yesterday. Success! No leaks when turned on hose. Hoping for best.Update 9/27/12 Still no leaks!
B000NCWP44 use these to replace all the old ones that leak or are disintegrated. used for hose and hose connections  great with add on
B000NCWP44 Hard to say too much about these simple little washers.  Replace the crap vinyl ones you usually get in hoses and attachements with good quality washers and fix those leaky joints.  I order several packs of these just to make sure I can find them when I want them.  It's the little things in life that you appreciate....
B000NCWP44 They were ok, but the bag was torn open with one missing when I located it inside the box. Never had that happen before or since at Amazon.
B000NCWP44 These are for 3/4 garden hose and if your like me it's easier to change them than have a leak.  These are a little thin but still work well, I have needed to double them up once, because they were so thin.
B000NCWP44 Cannot beat the price, they do what they are designed for and they are durable.I have used and re-used these washers on multiple hoses and sprinklers.
B000NCWP44 I used a washer to stop a leaky hose connection and it worked. The leak is now between the hose female end and the connection to the hose. I don't think there is a fix for that leak except buy a new hose. The rubber washers work.
B000NCWP44 These are the best I have gotten. They are thick enough not to squash easily and they are flexible enough to fill uneven spots on older faucets. I never have to get out the pliers to stop a leak. I always keep some around. There really is no disadvantage to them at all. I buy a set whenever I buy any hose related Gilmour item so that I can replace the junky ones that come standard with them and make installation easier. You should get these.
B000NCWP44 Basically these are red rubber washers like the ones that were used years ago. They work fine. Many products made today come with those plastic washers. I find that the plastic ones allow the fitting to loosen up on its own, which is very annoying.
B000NCWP44 These are made of good quality rubber so they should function very well and last for a long time to come
B000NCWP44 replaced one 2day on the 2nd of 2 ordered Gilmour* Platinum hoses from last year - should have sent that back. Now to 'crack of' the collar' to hopefully get problem fixed as this not a solution -Gilmour 20-58075 20 Series 8-Ply 5/8-Inch-by-75-Foot Flexogen Hose, Platinum
B000NCWP44 These washers fit perfectly and snuggly in your hose and nozzle as needed.  I had to use a flat blade screwdriver to firmly fit the washer in place.  That way it was tightly in place.  It keeps leaks from occurring at the spigot and at the nozzle.
B000NCWP44 If you use garden hoses, then you will eventually need these. The provider washers wear out or get lost. These are a cheap solution.
B000NCWP44 Though these washers work better than any others I've used, I would still like to see a softer washer become available. I have a lot of hoses and it would be so much nicer if I didn't have to turn the hose ends together with such force to get a good connection. I'm constantly moving hoses and changing lengths. Someone should make a good soft rubber washer. If anyone one knows of some, let me know.
B000NCWP44 These are excellent little washers. We do a lot of watering here in the desert and the sun is out from about 6AM to 9PM so washers take a beating and we replace most every year. However, why anyone would pay about 10 bucks (Amazon's price when this review was orginally posted) for hose washers is beyond me.I just purchased a few packs of these now that the price has dropped to a little over 2 bucks... Amazon price on 5/11/12 was 2.22 per 10-pack. The price difference may not seem like much but I recently purchased a 50 pack on eBay for 8.38 so that's under 2 bucks per 10 pack and that's a whole lot of washers.This is a good cart filler if you're a few bucks under 25 and these are great washers. Heavy duty rubber has lasted me longer than the plastic and other types of washers that come with most hoses and attachments. We have about 24 connections that require washers because we pump from a canal, water from field hydrants and also use several hose bibs on the house. It's hot here, the wind blows hard frequently, there's no humidity and all that adds us to a fast dry in the gardens and yard. We hate to waste water so spending a few bucks on washer, especially the Gilmour rubber ones, is much better than the water loss from the collective drips from inferior washers. However, even these do get a permanent crease that hot metal on the hose ends and the faucets will leave and though they don't leak they are hard to reuse the next season.
B000NCWP44 The important thing is the fact that they are rubber, not stamped-out cheap plastic.  They'll actually what they are supposed to do, and they'll last a lot longer than the cheap plastic junk.
B000NCWP44 I purchased a hose at wal mart and someone must have jacked the rings out of it. I plopped these in and it worked like a charm.
B000NCWP44 I am very glad to have these as &#34;back-ups&#34; for the usually cheap and thin one that comes with most hoses.  I used one on top of the one the hose had, and there is absolutely no leaking when watering my plants.  Love them and a very inexpensive solution.
B000NCWP44 Best use for auto irrigation projects.  No leaks secure the in near home prevents leaks to basement.Always have these available for projects where pressure finds its way past cheap washers. Well made and thicker.This brand and type best
B000NCWP44 These are good quality washers that are very well made. I bought these to replace some cracked washers of my garden hose. These are much better quality than the original ones that came with the hose.
B000NCWP44 Who can't use some extra washers; I can never seem to find mine when I really need one.  So I have this item on my Wish List to use whenever I need some extra amount to bring my order total up to the &#34;free shipping&#34; limit.  It is perfect for this.
B000ND3MGS This plant has been both more cold resistant and more pest resistant than the two dwarf cavendish banana plants growing in the same microclimate.  I bought the two cavendish plants at Home Depot with about eight leaves and about two feet high a week or two after I got this tiny nanner with four itsy bitsy leaves on it and they are all about the same size now.  We had two near-frosts that took a toll on the two others, but this plant never blinked at the cool weather.  So far so good.  It is now about three feet tall with no brown spots or blemishes of any kind, and no pest problems.  By comparison, the two dwarf cavendish plants always have at least a few leaves with brown spots on them no matter how often I care for them.  No fruit from any of them yet, but all things in their time. :)
B000ND3MGS Update: 8/30/2013:--------------------------------Plant has been dead for some time now.Update: 7/03/2013:--------------------------------This plant is just about completely dead now.Update: 1/13/2013:--------------------------------I managed to save the first plant, but I noticed a few days later after I've gotten the plant I noticed it was infested with spider mites. I used an insecticide on the plant, but it appears they already did damage to the plant. They were not discovered at first because they were all down inside the base of the plant. I suggest the seller (9GreenBox) to use insecticide on them ASAP.The insecticide I used isSafer Brand 5118 Insect Killing Soap - 16-Ounce Concentrate. It seemed to work on the first use, you should do it twice just to be sure none survived. If you're not sure if you have any you can look for small dots on your plant, move the leaf some and see if they move. If you're still not sure you can use a insecticide anyway.Also keep in mind this plant does NOT produce bananas. The image for the product is misleading. Any fruit it does produce is completely inedible, I'm not sure if the fruit will harm animals. I plan on picking them off and throwing them away just to be sure because I have three dogs.I've since then transplanted both of the trees into aSmart Pots 3-Gallon Smart Pot Soft-Sided Container, Tansince my last review. I used soil from my garden, yes it was not a \"great\" thing to do. But with the smart pot it seems to be doing good with it. Because the soil can get muddy when I water the tree it seems to do good with watering once a week. The only problem I have is with the first tree which was infested with spider mites.Keep in mind both trees came almost dead. But after a week or two of care it seems to come back and starts producing more leaves.For those of you that change your mind about keeping this plant you can grow it to the first flowering stage and get about $50 for it locally. If you let it flower fully then you can get about $110 for it.-------------------------------------------------------------------------Below is line is the old review-------------------------------------------------------------------------The I got the plant today, the leaves seem like their dying from the shipment. I'm giving it some emergency care to see if I can save it, two of the leaves were completely dead. I have it under a special light which acts like the sun. It's also in controlled heating at 80F.I suggest you expedite the shipping if you buy this, might be dead if you wait a week.Also, it seems like a second tree is starting to come up in the pot. I don't want to do any transplanting from the original pot until it's more healthy.I also have some organic fertilizer coming which I'm going to use on it.I'll update this review if I'm able to save it.
B000ND3MGS First of all, I can't believe these things survive the shipping process.Got mine about 3 weeks ago.  It was packed pretty well, but it was obvious one of the leaves wasn't very happy.  I transplanted it into a bigger pot after 3 days and put it outside where it gets full sun.  I have two new leaves already.  We'll see how it survives through the Oregon winter, but so far so good.  No complaints.Update 12/28/12: well this little guy survived through the first OR winter so I took it out of its pot and stuck it directly into the ground last spring.  I was getting about one new leaf per week during the height of the summer growing season and the plant is about 3 feet tall now.  It is now set to go for its second OR winter.Update 5/27/13: the 2nd OR winter didn't go so well.  We had a week where temps dropped into the teens and the ground was frozen.  That killed the plant since I hadn't mulched the ground or done any prep work to keep it warm, such as wrapping it with burlap.  I cut the plant at the base thinking I needed to start over, but much to my surprise, three new plants poked their heads out of the ground as soon as the soil warmed up in March.  They're now about a foot tall each and it will take a while for them to reach the stature of their Mom, but I'm thankful to have my plants back.  I will definitely take better care of them come next winter.
B000ND3MGS This thing has done great so far. It survived the winter well indoors. I may plant it in the backyard this year and see how hardy it really is.
B000ND3MGS Hirts sent me a nice baby banana tree, in a four inch pot. When I got it, it did look small, with an outer leaf that looked brownish, and half dead. There was a leaf growing out of the middle, tho. Within a few days of receiving the tree, I transplanted it into a  larger growers pot, using very free draining soil. (Use palm soil, which is like cactus soil, or mix together potting soil, vermiculite, perlite, and turface if you have it too). This creates a very loose soil, for fast root development. Also, fertilize your banana tree quite a bit, but don't burnt the tree. Use a balanced fertilizer, 10-10-10. Keep it in the sun, and keep it warm.  I would take the plant outside when the days would go up into the 60s, and take it inside at night, when the springtime tempertures dropped into the 30s and 40s.  During this first month, the banana tree grew like crazy. The leaf that looked brownish, just dropped away. These plants grow VERY fact at first, in order to develop its &#34;trunk&#34;.  New leaves come out of the center of the plant, unroll, and stretch out, each one bigger, and thicker, than the previous one.  Now its about 5 weeks after ordering, and I'd say it doubled in size easy.  The 6 inch pot I have it in, is basically too small for the banana palm tree.  I've been busy, fixing the banana tree a permanent home in my yard, while it's enjoying its childhood in the 6&#34; pot.The location of your banana tree is important.  It should get as much sun as possible, tho be protected from harsh winter north winds.  These trees need mulched for winter, and the internet has a lot of websites, and Utoob videos, to show how this is done. I dug up the soil, in a 3 foot radius, adding a lot of organic mulch to the soil, along with a bag of manure. These banana palms require a LOT of food, and a LOT of water, in order to make these huge growth spurts. Only now, in late May, can I even hope to plant this tree in the ground. (I live in region 5.) You need to wait til the nights warm up, and all danger of frost is past, to plant these.  If its down in the 40s at night, it wont kill the tree, but it just wont grow.  I'm going to plant it this Sunday, in the well prepared soil, that receives full sun.  I'll fertilize it again, and make sure it never wants for water.  Then, sit back and wait for my instant palm tree! I hear if you can push the tree to create 18 leaves (?) in one year, it'll bloom for you. That's what I want to see. So, don't worry about those outer leaves turning brown, and wilting. Its how these plants grow. As the outer leaves die, know this: larger, thicker, taller leaves are rolling out of the middle to replace it.
B000NJ3R26 Wanted a simple, inexpensive system for the raised garden in my alley.  Bought last year's model but didn't set it up because one of the hoses was badly kinked due to the way it was packaged by the manufacturer.  Decided to order another one this year, figuring I'd use 3 sections of hose and 4 sprinkler heads.  T'was not to be... Hose construction has been improved, but same packaging problem resulted in similar kink.  Went ahead and set up my original one (I'm returning new one) with just one hose and two heads. The sprayers worked reasonably well, and the spray is relatively close to the ground, which I liked.  Five nozzles are included - three are a full circular spray, one is cone shaped, and one is semi-circle - but don't think this is a high tech system.  The whole set-up is fairly primitive. The sprinkler heads are light weight plastic - so light that the slightest movement of the hose shifts them , making it hard to keep them flush with the ground. They really need to have some kind of weight set on them to keep them stationary and stable (or simply made heavier in the first place) .  I ended up not using them as my garden has a slope, which meant they had to be propped in order to be level.  I wasn't confident they wouldn't somehow get knocked off kilter, and as this was to constitute watering for an extended vacation it seemed too iffy,,,,
B000NJ3R26 First, my product seems to have a differnet hose than the one pictured above - and it is by far one of the most inferior/poor quality types of hose I've encountered to date. The actual sprinklers are all plastic so no worry about rust - but they are also very light weight and prone to move about easily. In a nutshell, this product works but for how long is another question entirely. For just a little more money I purchased three hose remnants and sprinkler heads here on Amazon - of MUCH better quality. I'm glad I only purchased one of these...given the cheap production we'll see how long it lasts but suffice to say, I won't be buying a 2nd one any time soon.
B000NJ3R26 Needed something to water a strip of lawn and these fit the bill perfect they are plastic but seem to be well made
B000NJ3R26 You're not going to leave this out over the winter. Perfect for spreading the sprinkling through a large vegetable garden. Easy to aim.
B000NJ3R26 Other reviews noted the low pressure, but where I use these, I don't need a lot of water pressure.  They work beautifully in a narrow area where you don't want to get water on the house.
B000NJTFPE This animal is the greatest thing since sliced bread. I originally replaced my perfectly good electric (with a cord) mower with the CMM1000 model 10 years ago and stopped dragging my cord around.It was like Christmas opening the box. Then I was disappointed in the fact that everything was put together. You did not need three hands to assemble obscurely named parts. They don't even care what angle you hold the mower at, as the battery does not spill. My lawn was so small that it is not even on the chart of square feet cut on a single charge. Following the instruction I plugged it in for 24 hrs prior to use. I was gearing up for an afternoon of mowing. I waved my arms around like Norton on the Honeymooners, disconnected the charger, inserted the safety key, pushed it to the lawn, and turned it on. It was so quiet that I had to make the motor sound my self. I used the mulcher mode so the rear bag is hanging on the wall. 15 minutes and it was all over. I am going to run out and find the best compost I can find so I can mow more often.-------------------------------------------------------A few changes have been made to the new model; the key is smaller. And some of the electronics were moved from the mower to the charger. I have not dismantled this one yet however the last one was very simple to dismantle as I replaced the batteries once after seven years.Black & Decker MB-850 19-Inch  Lawn Mower Replacement Blade
B000NJTFPE I just got this mower and this thing works great.  I charged it up overnight and then went about my lawn mowing.  I don't have that big of a lawn, would say about .08 of an acre so it had more than enough charge to cut the grass.  The mower is simple to use and requires no assembly except for the grass catcher bag.  Just remember to pull out the mulcher when you first use it if you want to catch the grass in the bag.The mower weighs about 80 pounds, and gets heavier as it fills with grass.  Flat lawns are effortless, but pushing it up an incline might prove troublesome for some.  It's not self propelled so it does take more effort, but once you start pushing and it's cutting the grass, it's not even noticeable.You just insert the safety key, and pull up the handle on the right side and off you go.  Instant on and off.  There is no option to plug in a cord so you will have to have it charged for each use if you want to cut your lawn.  Just make sure to charge it after each use and always leave it plugged in.  It's alot quieter than the gas mowers I have used and I think it is quiet enough that you can even cut the grass early morning without waking people up.Forget the trips to the gas station and no need to worry about gasoline catching on fire.  The charge is advertised to work up to 1/3 acre so if your lawn is smaller than that size, this is definitely the better choice.  Zero emissions and low noise.Again, Just remember to plug it in after every use and leave it plugged in year round and you should have a well maintained battery.
B000NJTFPE Smaller front and back yards, mow every 2 weeks on the average.  Have had for almost 3 and 1/2 years, still runs great.  Did recently have a problem with the power lever, a little plastic piece breaking off which made it unable to turn it on.  I opened it up and basically replaced the plastic with a nut & bolt and that part is now better than new.  This is extremely easy to adjust and to mow with.  It lasts quite a while on one charge, I would guess I could mow a baseball field infield grass (probably about size of my lawn) no problem.
B000NJTFPE So far, I'm thrilled with this purchase!After I charged it overnight, it mowed my 1/4 acre lot and big back yard without problem. No fumes, no oil, no gas, relatively little noise and it's SO much easier to plug something in than run to the gas station to fill a container!The push bar also collapses easily when you want it to, so it fits well into a nook in my already crowded two-car garage!I also like the idea that if I throw solar panels on my roof, I'll be able to fuel my mower with completely clean energy so I just may have to in the next couple of years!
B000NJTFPE Although this mower works well at cutting grass and bagging leaves, the switch is very poorly designed and has broken on both (I purchased two mowers since I have a larger yard) mowers within one year. A flimsy plastic handle pivots on a thin plastic post, held by a light-weight spring. The plastic post degrades and fatigues quickly, and eventually breaks off at both ends, resulting in a mower that will not operate.  I have not subjected the mower to unusually severe treatment, and cannot fathom why an otherwise well-designed appliance should have such a poorly designed switch.
B000NJTFPE The four stars is actually for our CMM1000 which was the first generation of this mower.  It's been a trooper for us and the only thing we do is sharpen the blades once a year and we've swapped out the batteries only once!&lt;COMPARO>I've put a quick guide of the most popular models on Amazon.

They are super quiet, clean, and convenient. They aren't necessarily cheaper than a gas mower since they cost more up front but there is almost NO maintenance. (We spent $80 over 10 years for a set of replacement batteries.) Corded electric mowers are a lot cheaper but then you have a cord.>>Why SHOULDN'T I get a cordless mower? They weigh a LOT more than gas mowers so if you have a hilly lot or have difficulty with physical exertion, forget it. They don't have as much power as gas and re-fueling means charging for a few hours so if your lot is over  acre you may want to reconsider.>>Why do they all come with mulching PLUS bagging? Electric powered mowers have come a long ways but mulching still takes a LOT more power than discharging, so bagging is pretty much a standard feature.>>What is a watt-hour? It's basically how big your gas tank is - the more watt-hours, the longer you can mow before you have to recharge.>>Is the cutting path a big deal? Yes - for two reasons. 1) The first thing manufacturers do when power is marginal is reduce the blade size, so I tend to see the smaller mowers as more likely to be underpowered. Second, when you consider that you have to overlap each pass by ~3\", a 20\" blade now effectively cuts 13% more on each pass. If you have a larger yard, you definitely do NOT want anything under 18\"  Also, my measurements show most mowers overstate their blade size by 1/2\" (Our 20\" measures 19-5/8, our 19 measures 18-1/2)>>Why might I want a removable battery? If you have a large yard, this means you can have a second battery charging while you are using the first. A second battery typically costs $100-$150 but it can make the difference between going electric or not. Finally, if you keep the mower in a shed that doesn't have power, a removable battery will let you bring it in for charging.>>How long will my batteries last?  That depends on your climate and usage.  We had a small lot for many years and were religious about recharging right after use.  We also live in a cooler climate (Michigan) so the mowing season is shorter.  Our batteries lasted about 7 years.  Most people should get 3-4 years easily but if you're careless and live in Arizona, you could probably kill the batteries in a year or two.>>Why should I care about higher voltage? Higher voltage = more power, PLUS you can recharge the mower faster. With the same chemistry and current, a 36V mower will charge 50% faster than a 24V mower.>>Metal deck or plastic? Metal rusts but with minimal care it's not an issue. Plastic ends up giving you a more stuff to trim since you can't cut as close to fences, etc.If you've found this review helpful or have questions/comments, please let me know!
B000NSGNOG This is sort of a difficult product to evaluate. It is supposed to help keep algae from growing in your pool, but other things we use in the pool also do that. So if no algae grows, is this chemical responsible for it, or is it just maintaining acceptable chlorine levels and this stuff is irrelevant?I originally bought it as a stab at getting rid of some black algae stains plaguing a few spots on the vinyl liner. It did not help those.However, we've had a VERY rainy, often very hot summer. Those are perfect conditions for algae growth, and I haven't been using any more chlorine or algaecide than normal. I have been using three capfuls of this once a week. I haven't seen the first tiny spot of algae try to get a toehold this summer. With experience over 19 years of pool ownership, under these weather conditions I would say that is very unusual, and very pleasant.Since adding this chemical is the only thing I'm doing different than years where I might have had to brush off a few algae spots, I'm going to give it credit. It certainly is no more expensive than using extra algeacide and shock, and those are responsive measures rather than preventative measures. Its better to have the algae not show up in the first place than to have to beat it back when it does.Recommended.
B000NSGNOG This is a great product if you are like me and prefer using natural pool products instead of swimming in chemicals. This is the second product you use to keep the phosphates down after using phos free. Phos free brings phosphates down, pool perfect plus phos free is the maintenance step to keep them in check. Algae feed on phosphates, so remove the food bye bye algae. Note when algae die they put off phosphates as well. Once you get phosphates under 500 you can use this.If you have an algae bloom like I did before finding this stuff this company also has a super concentrate called first aid. I used a product called banish as I did not know about first aid at the time. I slowly reduced the phosphates after the outbreak although you can dump a whole jug without any issues.You must still watch your chlorine levels and don't let them drop, but you can use less chlorine, or in my case turn the salt water generator down some.
B000NSGNOG My pool can't function without Phos Free ... just a little bit each week keeps the algae at bay!  My pool is very hot (94 degrees in the summer) and even hotter if I run the hot tub; so some sort of algae control is absolutely required.  When I'm using Phos Free, the pool is algae free and clear as a bell!
B000NSGNOG use this if yo uhave any algae issues.  once you get rid of your algae, this will keep it away. i promise you that.  i found this item while i had a profesional pool company cleaning my pool.  when i went to the pool supply store, to buy it, the guy asked if i had a pool cleaning company.  i said no, and he said it is the best kept secret out there. one product that keeps you rpool super clean and algae free!!FORGET ALL THE CRAP ON THE SHELVES....USE THIS!  using this for over five years now and it works great!
B000NSGNOG I developed algae in my pool that kept coming back, even after treating the algae with an algaecide.  Well, I finally learned that to rid your pool of algae you have to first rid it of phosphates because that it basically the food for your algae.  And if you don't remove the phosphates, the algae will keep coming back.So, I first started with Phos Free.  Not the one labeled Pool Perfect + Phos Free because that is just for maintenance.  Look for the one they call simply \"Phos Free\" (by the same company).  That is like a shock treatment to rapidly remove the phosphates from your water.  Just follow the directions on that product, and then once your phosphate levels are down to an acceptable level (zero is best, but I've been told up to 300ppm is acceptable) THEN you can start using the Pool Perfect + Phos Free product on a weekly basis to maintain it.I now add the Pool Perfect + Phos Free to my pool once a week, and have not seen any algae re-appear.  It's been a couple months since I started using it, and I am very happy with it.***P.S.  I originally bought this product from Leslie's Pool Supply, but I will never buy any product from them again after I found out that their website rating system is rigged.  They will NOT publish a review about a product if it is negative in the slightest bit.  They will only publish (or maybe even write themselves) a review for a product if it is positive, so you never know if you're reading accurate/fair reviews or not.  I have emailed their corportate headquarters about this numberous times regarding my concern over why only my positive reviews are showing up on their website, but they haven't fixed the problem and don't even have the courtesy to respond.  Do NOT buy from Leslie's.  Amazon is the only way to go because at least you can read ALL the reviews and judge for yourself.
B000NSGNOG Boy, does this work! We had a green pool from the winter winds and spring pollen. This worked within 2 days of back-flushing and one filter cleaning. My gardener couldn't believe that the pools was clean and clear within one week (actually 3 days). This is the best price for the product but the nice part is having it delivered.
B000NSGNOG I just started using Phos-Free/Pool-Perfect this year on my 12,500-gallon pool.  It works.  The water is as clear as it was when the pool was first filled 7 years ago.  I use 1-1/2 capfuls once a week and no sign of the algae that showed up early-on this year and the water is crystal-clear.  When this runs out, I'll buy another container.  Simplest product to use that does what it says it will.  Can't beat that.
B000NSGNOG Being a new pool owner I don't know if by using this stuff I am eliminating the need to use other chemicals or not.  I have an automatic cleaner, use (3) 3&#34; chlorine tablets weekly and occassionally use muriatic acid to bring pH levels to where they should be.  I add 2 capfuls of the Pool Perfect + Phosfree weekly for my 22,000 gallon pool.  That's it.  My pool is spotless, no issues with discoloration, cloudiness, or smells.  Someone also commented that our water doesn't have that chlorine smell to it.  I don't know if it's because of using this or what?  Our chlorine levels are in line with what they should be.
B000NVDGFM I bot this hoping it would protect my feeder but the squirrels got right around it.  At first they would fall off, but then they eventually figured it out.  Also, in a windy storm my feeder and the bottom hook on the underside of the baffel fell right off.  Hook is lost in the snow, had to buy a new one at hardware store.  Can not recommend this.  Am going to try to coat it wish vaseline or wd40, see if that works.  Otherwise it is on to another feeder.
B000NVDGFM I got this cover to go with my birdfeederPerky-Pet 312C Panorama Bird Feeder, Copperto keep the squirrels off of it and to protect the feeder from the rain.  So far I haven't seen any squirrels any where near it, but it didn't quite shelter my feeder like I hoped and the seeds got soaked during a recent light rain.  Still, it is attractive (well, as attractive as these things go) and it had kept the squirrels out of my feeder so far.
B000NVDGFM This keeps the rain out of my dish-style hummingbird feeder perfectly.  It's also a deep dome so the feeder tucks up inside it just perfectly.  The hummingbirds can access it while the rain cannot.
B000NVDGFM I love this.  The seed in the feeder no longer gets soaked during rain storms and the birds at the feeder stay dry, too.
B000NVDGFM We had just purchased a couple of replacement bird feeders and wanted to get something smaller than the large domes for protecting the feeders from some of the rain.  While nothing will protect a feeder from a driving rain, this cover does very well for steady down pours and for light rain on our tube style bird feeders.The unit is very well made and is simple to assemble.  Both of the hooks pictured on the dome are included and they screw into the metal plate in the dome after you screw on a locking nut to each hook.  Once you thread in the hook you use the nut you previously put on to tighten against the metal plate.  This locks the hook in place so that it will come out with use.Would highly recommend this to anyone who needs a rain shield.  Keep in mind that this is NOT a squirrel baffle, but so far it has worked sell as such due to its steep sides.
B000NVM2L6 Little birdies love this feeder. I wonder if they get confused by their reflection in the window.I like that this feeder is window-mounted because not only can I watch them from inside, but the feeder is up and away from squirrels or stray kitties.
B000NVM2L6 Easy to use.
B000NVM2L6 I thought this would be great for our birds to feed at our window.  But very few want to perch on it.  Plus, it doesn't drain well.  After one season, the plastic discolored, and the suction cups wouldn't stick to the window.
B000NVM2L6 This was a gift I appreciated greatly  after my old one was ravaged by a storm.Since I had already acquired regular birdie visits from my previous one, the birds came back to feed without hesitation. The most common visitors are sparrows and chickadees.The clean application of this feeder onto the glass is key to a secure hold. Also make sure you place it within easy reach for cleaning and refilling.I'm not the only one enjoying birds at the window, my cats who are never outdoors are also entertained.Great gift for any bird lover, I recommend this to anyone who enjoys a close, indoor view of birds.
B000NVM2L6 Edit: 2 to 5 starsThis is a decent design and stays up well (and holds 2 cups of seed). But, the birds in my area utterly ignore both of the ones I purchased even though they bathe in the water-feeder right next to it. I have them on different sides of the house where the finches gather, and no-go.  They eat the seed it is filled with elsewhere, just not from the feeder.Edit:After several months of ignoring this feeder, the mother finches have found it in earnest and have taught their babies.  The finches used it all through spring and summer last year and are coming back in droves now that winter is warming up in California. The feeders are so popular that 6-10 more finches regularly line up on the fence railing waiting their turn!Now that there are birds inside or on top of both feeders most of the day my house cats are THRILLED. They have something so fascinating to watch just inches from their cat tree. My kitties spend 4+ hours a day watching birds and it has greatly improved their mood for the rest of the day; they're more attentive and loving.If you want to use 2+ feeders, place a second feeder out of sight of the first and the birds will fight less. I have a corner window (windows that come to a corner) and they the birds seem to prefer one feeder on each side vs both on one big window.
B000NVM2L6 Suction cups just don't work.  We have caulked this little feeder to the window.  I wish whoever makes suction cups would work on something that works. Good product - just make sure you figure out how to keep it up.
B000NVM2L6 I put this on a second-story window and it took less than two days for the birds to find it. So far, mainly the titmice, chickadees and house finches are eating from it. But I am hopeful that eventually I'll get some cardinals to find it. Its very easy to install...just read the instructions in these reviews about how to do it. Worked like a charm. I plan on buying more and putting them in various windows around the house.Update: I have now purchased 4 of these. The birds love them. I have never seen a Cardinal come to any of the feeders (they are hanging on first and second floor windows). I have mostly the birds mentioned above and wren, as well as nuthatches and woodpeckers if I put peanut butter suet in it. I have gotten mostly hairy and downy woodpeckers, which are small enough to actually sit inside the box. But I got a red bellied woodpecker the other day. He was MUCH too large to fit in the box, so hung off the side and rocked forward to grab the suet and then leaned back to eat it. He rocked back and forth a few times, flew away...and came back many times. I have suet in cages all around the house. But for some reason he wanted to go through the trouble of eating at this little plastic bird feeder. DETERMINATION!
B000NVM2L6 We loved it till the squirrel noticed it and started jumping on it trying to get to the food.  The idea is great but you have to find a window that isn't near a tree with squirrels around.
B000NVM2L6 My 2 cats love this feeder as it brings the outside birds right up to their ledge on the inside of the window. I received the feeder yesterday and filled it with sunflower seed and hung it even though heavy rains and winds were forecast.  Not only did the feeder NOT blow down, the seed inside remained dry!  YAY - no more wasted, moldy seed!
B000NVM2L6 This is a neat concept although I have not had any birds use it here yet. It's winter so I'm guessing by the spring it will fill up. I wish it was slightly bigger so that larger birds like a dove, cardinal could use. It would need another suction cup though.
B000NVM2L6 I have had 1 bird in it since I put it up..Have changed the food but they still don't come.  Would not buy another one. I think maybe a bigger opening would help..but
B000NVM2L6 No, the Perky Pet Window Feeder won't last forever -- a year or so before the suckers weather -- but while it's stuck to your window you'll be able to get a close look at our feathered friends, which can be so much fun for kids and adults.We stuck ours on the window next to the breakfast table.  The children got to where they'd sit so they could watch the chickadees and sparrows drop by to have breakfast with them.  And my husband and I enjoyed sitting quietly drinking coffee and doing not much else but waking up and watching them dart to and fro.I liked these small feeders well enough that every year I now buy them for the children's teachers.  Though I must admit that in kindergarten they didn't stay up long because they were too much fun and the little ones were paying more attention to who was dropping by to eat than their teachers (lol!)THE SKINNY:::Sticks well enough.  Can be difficult to fill if you don't think about this aspect before deciding on a site.  Didn't need cleaning unless there was a real downpour.  (You don't want the seed to get moldy and gross.)We highly recommend.Pam T and family~
B000NVM2L6 This window bird feeder works, but only stood up to 1 season of use for me before requiring repairs.  It's flimsy plastic, so you get what you pay for.Pros:- Plastic is clear, so watching birds is easy- The roof does help keep the bird seed dry- The suction cups had plenty of holding power and held to the glass through most of the winter- The plastic cleaned up well with dish soap and water- The limited opening was an effective deterrent to squirrel raids.Cons:- The feeder consists of two halves of plastic that are held together by 5 little nibs along the seam.  Through normal use, these nibs broke and my feeder started to separate.  Luckily, super glue works well.- The opening is only big enough for a single bird, in my experience, without squabbles.- A single fall, if the suction cups give out, will likely result in a broken feederI think it's just o.k. because it is easily damaged and didn't permit more than one bird to feed at a time.  I ultimately upgrade to aSongbird Essentials Recycled Plastic Window Bird Feeder.  It's more accessible by squirrels, but allows several birds to feed at once without squabbles and is built far more ruggedly than a plastic window feeder.Tip:  To increase suction cup strength, clean the window well and put a minute amount of cooking oil on the suction cup.  It increases holding power significantly.
B000NVM2L6 Not only do we humans enjoy the close up bird views, but my cats think this is the best invention ever.  They spend hours watching and making little cat chirps of joy. Best gift under $10 one can buy!
B000NVM2L6 This bird feeder is a total piece of crap.  It's made of cheap thin plastic with teensy connectors to bring both halves together.  Two of the flimsy connection prongs immediately broke upon insertion.  I doubt the product cost 25 cents to make.  Avoid this poorly made feeder.
B000NZZG3S This thermostat is a pretty nice construction.  The thermometer lead has a nice length to it.  The thermometer is pretty accurate and has nice response times.
B000NZZG3S I use this with the Hydrofarm CK64050 Germination Station with Heat Mat and it works great with it. The temperature could be faster at updating though. Sometimes I have to wait 10-15 minutes for a stable temperature after using fresh soil.
B000NZZG3S I picked this up for my son who just moved to St. Louis... pause for involuntary shake due to cold weather... and it connects perfectly to a flexible heat wrap to allows him to keep a constant temperature on his home brew year rounds.  Good thing he works for the largest brewer in St. Louis!
B000NZZG3S No more turning on and off the heat mat.  This little baby monitors the heat and keeps it at the temperature that you set it for.  I used to use the heating pad method under my seedling trays, but now they make most of them that turn off after a certain amount of time and that leaves the seedlings cold and without heat.  I bought two of the Hydrofarm seedling heat mats, plugged this digital thermostat in and never turned back.  I used it this Spring in the little conservatory where I keep the citrus trees in the winter.  It performed flawlessly.  If you want to keep a consistent heat under your little seedlings; this is the way to do it.
B000NZZG3S A must too help regulate temps for sprouting seeds and rooting clones .This will help speed up the time for root development, better the chance for successful germination & better success in rooting clones as well.Well worth my investment .
B000NZZG3S This keeps my heat mat at a steady temperature for seed germination. I used it for all my seeds this winter and it worked like a charm. I would recommend this product to anyone that grows plants from seed.
B000NZZG3S This made the Hydrofarm CK64050 Germination Station with Heat Mat more usable.  I hated that I could not tell at what temperature my seedlings were.  With just the heat mat I knew it would not be cold but did not know how hot.  This thermostat is awesome.  I feel like I have all the information I need to grow seeds and cuttings in a perfect environment, with a humidity dome.  I got this thermostat right after I got the germination station with heat mat. Then I also bought the higher dome cover.  7&#34; so my cuttings would fit.
B000NZZG3S Bought this along with the heat mat and glad I did. My greenhouse gets pretty warm during the day so this helps keep the mat from overheating my seed trays. It's really nice, easy to use and constantly displays the temp of your medium. It has a sensor that you push into the medium so it's measuring the temp of the soil at all times. Well worth it!
B000NZZG3S Used this thermostat for about five months, in a greenhouse, in conjunction with a heat mat.  It maintained the set temperature pretty well.  The only fault I can find is that the readout can be difficult to see in a bright environment such as a greenhouse.
B000NZZG3S This thing is such an absolute delight. Your heat mat plugs into this thermostat and then the thermostat plugs into the wall socket. Programming it is a breeze and the included sensor just goes into the plant bed. The only slight downside is sometimes the ideal heat may not be reached all the time. To solve this, simply unplug the thermostat from the wall and then plug it in again.
B000NZZG3S I have half a dozen of these thermostats to control 48&#34;x20&#34; heat mats.  The temperature maintained seems very accurate.  Heavy AC cable is overkill for controlling a 120W mat.
B000NZZG3S I just purchased my second one of these and so far they both have been working perfectly. There is nothing on the market in this price range that gives you a readout of the current temps with a nice bright red LED.Everything else is over $150.00........!Mine are actually used for ceramic heater.The Max current: 8.3 amps / 1000 watts
B000NZZG3S With this thermostat you can have complete temperature control and always will know what the temperature is.  The heat mat will work good without a thermostat  but works Great with one.
B000NZZG3S If you bought the Seedling Heat Mat your going to need this thermostat to complete your set up, with this it's a synch to have your heat mat keep its correct temperature, very easy to set then you just sit back and let it do its job.
B000NZZG3S The digital thermostat works with the Company's heat matHydrofarm CK64050 Germination Station with Heat Mat- there's nothing it can do on its own.It's ruggedly made, easy to use, program, understand and read. You might wonder how it works with the heat mat - you just plug the 3-prong plug from the mat, into the receptacle on the thermostat - which, in turn, plugs into the wall.I've had mine working for 2 weeks, and I can read it at a glance. I've confirmed that the temperature is what it says it is with a separate thermometer - bang on.I'm starting herbs (cilantro, parsley, basil and more) right now, and all the little green guys are up, and apparently loving the consistent temperature and humidity in the germination station.Recommended!
B000NZZG3S I have 4 of these currently and use them for all kinds of different things.It is very easy to use right out of the box and the temperature gauge is surprisingly accurate and they all have always been right on point with my external thermometers.Highly recommended!
B000OM82J0 Seems this product is best for getting your seeds to take off and root fast, looking forward to seeing how it helps with the garden outdoors. Does well with house plants
B000OM82J0 Using Superthrive to boost my plants health this summer and it will boost my crops production.  You don't need much for it to be effective.
B000OM82J0 This is some amazing stuff! It works fast and a great supplements for the garden. I'm never unhappy when I buy this product.
B000OM82J0 I've head from various reviews that it's just not the same as the 'old' formulation. Far as I can tell, it works as it always has. i've used this stuff for forty years, and it's good stuff.
B000OM82J0 This liquid is like having plants on steroids!We kept all of our summer geraniums &#34;juiced&#34;all winter and the result was obvious(not leggy,but full of greenery.It is really concentrated,plants love it and it is a great&#34;recovery solution &#34;for plants in distress.
B000OM82J0 I have been using this stuff since.....well, 40 years, and I still think it is the best thing out there to make plants stay happy!
B000OM82J0 I have been using this for over a year in order to really give it a chance.  I've used it on various potted plants as well as plants in the garden.  I really wanted this stuff to work but I wanted to be objective.  I only used it on half of my plants of each variety to see if there would be a difference.  Soil, fertilisers, care, light etc were all the same but only half got the \"Superthrive\".  ABSOLUTELY NO DIFFERENCE.  It didn't seem to harm the plants but also made ZERO difference to growth, flowering, size or taste.  Obviously some people love this stuff but I can't see why...placebo effect?  If it was as spectacular as it claims, then why wouldn't it be a standard product for all commercial growers?  Bottom line for them is money and obviously they see this as a waste...as do I.
B000ORYO4W I have been using a Hoover Spin Sweep for years (on my second one) so when this came up, I thought it would be a good product to review. My review is going to mainly be as a comparison with the Hoover model.Karcher better than Hoover1) Cleaner pick up. The Karcher uses a single round broom in the back to scoop up debris and deposit it in the bin. It does a much better job of cleaning up what you roll over. The Hoover relies on the front 2 brushes to sweep debris into the bin and tends to leave a small line of debris from where the 2 brushes come together2) Better front spinning brushes. The secret of the Karcher front brushes is they a geared to spin slower than the Hoover's. This results in a gentler sweeping action that does not fling debris to the left and right like the Hoover does, especially the faster you walk. The bristles are softer and do a good job a simply moving debris under the sweeper to be swept up by the back brush3) Dust bin easier to empty. It just sits in place and you do not need to push a button to get it out or press down to click it back in place. The problem with the Hoover over the years is the bin lock can break because you are pushing down in the same spot to lock it back in placeHoover better than Karcher:1) Easier to push. The Karcher seems to have a lot of gears to turn and it is noticeably harder to push than the Hoover, which seems feels featherweight in comparison2) Better with large debris. The Karcher has a &#34;twig catcher&#34; in the form of plastic fins that are supposed to keep large objects out of the bin, but it tends to get clogged up. Since I have a lot of little twigs to sweep up, this has been something I have to avoid with the Karcher. The Hoover seems to be able to swallow everything.3) Brush bumpers. The Hoover has bumpers with wheels on the outer part of the machine that do an excellent job of guiding the sweeper around walls and corners so the brushes keep spinning. The Karcher's brushes are unprotected and you can easily jam them to a stop against walls4) Steering. The Hoover steers easily and goes in a straight line. The Karcher seems to have a mind of its own and you are constantly adjusting it to stay in a straight line5) Reach. The Hoover uses the front brushes in a single step to sweep debris up at the front of the sweeper, so you can usually get anything the brushes touch into the box, but the Karcher uses a 2 step approach and you have to travel the length of the sweeper before the debris get lifted into the bin. Imagine trying to clean up under a table. The Hoover would get everything as far as you can push, but the Karcher would need more room to travel to get the same debris.6) Containment. This is something perhaps particular to my situation. I have to move the sweeper up a step to cover the area I sweep. Picking the Hoover up with the handles angles the front up as I move it. It also angles the Karcher the same way. But when you tilt the Karcher backwards, some of the debris in the bin falls back out, onto the rear brush and gets stuck in there and ends up being redistributed all over the ground as you move it, You have do extra sweeping to get it all up. The Hoover bin stays contained and even helps, because as the bin gets almost full, it can start coming out the front. The Hoover has a bigger bin, tooAt first I thought the Karcher was much worse than the Hoover, but as I used it more, I've come to realize it may be better for some jobs than others. It does a better job on driveway debris, for example. I really wanted to give it 3.5 stars.In the end, I would say use the Karcher if you have a lot of flat area with a lack of big twigs to pick up and you want a clean sweep (a garage floor would be good). But if you want an easier to push and guide sweeper that can pick up bigger and more debris, but not do it as cleanly, the Hoover might be better. I'm luck to have both, so I can switch between the two depending on the job.
B000ORYO4W Karcher's a great company. I like their products. This one is targeted to people who want to sweep concrete, as on sidewalks, driveways, and garages. The compartment that holds the debris isn't very big, so it won't hold a huge amount of leaves, etc. However, it is easy to maneuver and seems to be built well. If you are SERIOUSLY SERIOUS about keeping the concrete around your house fastidiously clean, this may be the right machine for you.
B000ORYO4W This sweeper was very easy to assemble. (The assembly instructions had no words, just diagrams.)The sweeping area is large. It's about 26 inches across (from the outside edges of the round brushes). The sweeper is very easy to maneuver and make turns. it has a cylindrical brush at the back of the unit and 2 round brushes at the front. It is not perfect at picking up debris, but I prefer this over the loud blower that we usually use to clean up the driveway.I like that the handles fold down to make it more compact for storage.
B000ORYO4W I got this push sweeper to do my walkways and driveway, because I hate carrying the leaf blower around, it gets very heavy after a while. So I started with my driveway, because now that the warmer weather is here, I wanted to sweep up all the dirt and salt from the snow, and this sweeper did a great job with that, but the compartment is kind of small, so it doesn't hold a whole lot, and I found myself emptying it constantly. However, it is very easy to put together, and very easy to push along the driveway and walkway. The good thing about this is that I can push it, and not have to carry anything. It does a great job with picking up debris, it's just the emptying it constantly that is bothersome. I feel like this should be geared towards the older generation that wants to clean their own walkways and driveways, but don't want to carry around a leaf blower. Or even towards people that have back problems, because you can lean on it while your pushing it. I just wish it had a bigger compartment so I don't have to keep emptying it.
B000ORYO4W It was quick and easy to assemble.  It is a cinch to push. It picks up all the debris. I use it on my sidewalks, patios, and my messy garage floor.
B000ORYO4W This sweeper is better than a broom in some ways, and not better in other ways.When it's better than a broom...After running my lawn edger, my sidewalks are full of grass clippings that I would rather not blow back onto the lawn to turn brown and ugly. Running this sweeper on my long sidewalks is much better than using a broom. It does a good job of collecting the clippings and saves my hands from blisters.When it's not better than a broom...Tight areas such as the garage.When the grass or leaves are wet.If there are clumps of soil.Mostly, I'd say it's better. I'm glad I have it simply for the clean-up after edging. It's worth it for me just for that.
B000OV8OTY Sticky Stakes successfully wooed and killed tiny gnats growing in my potted plants.  Although the view of used Sticky Stakes is not pleasant, the work is done.  I highly recommend this product.
B000OV8OTY Works amazing.  Attracts fruit flies and fungus gnats.  However, know that this is really only a &#34;band-aid&#34; to your problem and may not solve your problem with one or two applications.  If you have fruit flies, the root of the problem will probably be left over food somewhere, check dishwasher, under the counter, take the garbage out more frequently.  If you have fungus gnats, it will most likely be moist environments and decaying plant matter, i.e. stop watering your plants so frequently.
B000OV8OTY I had a big problem with nats and this did the trick for me it took about a month but it worked like a charm.
B000OV8OTY We were having trouble with white flies and other insects that were killing our tomatoes and other potted plants, This little trap catches them easily and since we do not like insecticides, it is part of 
B000OV8OTY These work well for helping control the mass populations of fungus gnats that seem to breed in the potting soil of my houseplants. The only problem with them is there is no good way to peel the backing off and stick the paper into the holders without getting the sticky residue on your fingers. I've tried several different techniques but I always end up getting my fingers all tacky and it is hard to get off even with soap and water.
B000OV8OTY These work great.  You stick them on little spikes, (if you can get them off of your fingers) and the little insects stick to them.
B000OWF7YI WOW!  Whenever I have trouble growing a plant, I have to look absolutely *no* further than Miracle Gro.  By the next day (assuming it's a sunny warm day) the wilted leaves and stems are guaranteed to look MUCH healthier and beautiful by simply adding only a touch of Miracle Gro.  No matter WHAT kind of plant it is, this stuff seriously works amazingly well.  I can't recommend it highly enough!  Just last week my tomato and pepper plants were looking ill for example, and Miracle Gro completely gave those plants the refreshment and reinvigoration they so desperately needed, haha.  What a great way to help any plant that's looking wilted and weak.  Get ready for the surprise of your life!
B000OWF7YI this is another great buy , I use this in my garden all summer an my garden is the biggest an best out of my whole neighborhood please buy this if you have a garden or planting one it works
B000OWF7YI I have a container vegetable garden each summer for years since I don't have space for a garden in ground.  I have relied on Miracle-Gro for years to feed and fertilize my container grown vegetables.  Easy and convenient to use... just dissolve in water and feed to your plants every 7-14 days.  You would be amazed how many vegetables- peppers, cucumbers, eggplant, tomatoes and the like you can grow in a few pots on your deck or patio.  Also great for your houseplants.
B000OWF7YI You can't go wrong with miracle-geo for annuals and perennials. Feed the as directed and you will have healthy plants. Am I selling the product, no! However I am a horticulturist and know plants well. At the same time I would not use this on my vegetables because it is a chemical. Again, good for annuals and perennials.
B000OWF7YI Which I found somewhat confusing, especially when I wanted to use it in a non-Miracle-Gro hose-end sprayer. Eventually I gave up on the sprayer and went back to measuring two tablespoons per two gallons of water. It's hard to beat Miracle-Gro.
B000OWF7YI I have read and been following all the reviews of this product so far. So far this product is working wonders on my garden, it is one of the ingredients I am using this year for a strong healthy garden. I am using this product for all my vegetables and flowers. I have 14 different varieties of corn, I have 12 different varieties of carrots, I have 94 tomato plants of different varieties, I have broccoli and I have cabbage, peppers sweat and hot, I have cabbage and herbs, peas and beans, watermelon strawberries and canalope, I have onions and a lot of other things and so far everything is growing big and strong. I am using one package a week it comes with eight packages and I mix it with water and keep it in a water sprayer. Do not dump right on plants and do not let the blue sit on the plants in powder form. us as directed will do just fine. I also used cow manuer in the ground before I planted and I make sure to water every day unless it is raining outside. But I do like this product and I do keep pictures and videos from day to day as to compare the different years to see what works and so far this product is working and doing a great job. I have very healthy plants that are bigger then even I expected.
B000OWF7YI This works great to feed all my potted plants and hanging baskets. Just a tablespoon or two in each can of water and I can be sure my plants will be well fed. Buying the large size is way more economical too.
B000OWF7YI This has got to be the biggest box of Miracle Grow plant food ever.  When you get it, you'll be so happy!  It will last forever.  I use it on my potted fruit trees, in my sprayer, too.  Don't buy it anymore at the grocery store or home warehouse.  I can't believe the price!
B000OWF7YI I really wasn't expecting the growth for my Lilac bush. It exploded. A few days later, I looked and the thing was all over the place. Pruning time for sure.Picea abies 'Hillside Upright' got lots of bright, new growth as well. Hemlocks are happy. Just fed baby boxwoods yesterday and they already seemed to grow noticeably.
B000OWF7YI Miracle-Gro has always been good and I got this because of the price and convenience. All one has to do is put one of the packets the box contains  into the Miracle-Gro Sprayer (Miracle-Gro 100410 Garden Feeder) and one can feed the lilacs and everything else in sight in a relatively short time.
B000OWF7YI I bought this for my house plants and it's more than I'll ever need.  The tub is huge, and all I need is a little tiny scoop (it comes with the scoop) in a bucket of water.  This can also be used with the Miracle-Gro garden feeder, which is actually a more appropriate use for this given the bulk size of the container.I have a tendency to neglect my plants, just water them now and then so they don't die.  Every so often, I decide I'd better take better care of them and start feeding them Miracle-Gro.  They start greening up the very next day.  What a difference.  I love how they look when I feed them Miracle-Gro.
B000OWF7YI I just bought the same 10 pound box for 17.88 at the local Home Depot.I've been using the granular Miracle Grow for 30 years or so.  It works well.  You can expect most plants to show improvement after about 10 days.COMPARISON TO MIRACLE GROW LIQUID FERTILIZER.As others have noted regarding the soluble fertilizer feeder (used with the granular fertilizer), the feeder it is erratic.  If you don't empty the container and allow it to dry after every use, it can clog up internally and will cease to deliver fertilizer.  The Liquid Miracle Grow system has exactly the same problems (in my experience, worse), and is the fertilizer is more expensive.OTHER CONCERNS> Sometimes you get a bright blue stream, and a few seconds later, a colorless stream (presumably containing less fertilizer).> A different situation is when a few minutes of watering, the solution is considerably less blue.  What happens is that the blue pigment is more soluble than other components of the fertilizer, but the blue pigment itself is probably not an essential component of the fertilizer.  As long as there is at least a teaspoon of undissolved fertilizer in the container, the feeder is still probably delivering full-strength fertilizer solution.TIPS ON USE:Fill about half (not more than half) the container with water.  Pour in the dry fertilizer---much of it will dissolve instantly as it hits the water, making room for the rest of the bag.  Add water as necessary to fill the container.  Screw the sprayer onto the container.  Shake (and turn upside down) to mix.  The first several minutes will be very rich, so use it where you need the most fertilizer.  Swirl the container occassionally as you water to encourage the undesolved fertilizer to dissolve.  Concentrate on spraying the leaves, not the soil---the soil will get enough dripping from the leaves.When there gets to be only a teaspoon of undesolved fertilizer in the container, consider it \"used up\".  You can continue to water, but don't assume that you are applying fertilizer.  When you are nearly done, turn the container upside down.  That will empty the container, including any undesolved fertilizer, so the fertilizer stream can be rich, so spray it where it is needed.  Water with the container upside down for 30 seconds or so after the container is empty to rinse out the internal passageways.  Ideally, you should take the sprayer off the hose, and open it so that the sprayer and container and dry out fully.FEEDING SCHEDULEA good soaking will provide your plants with all the nutrients they need for a 2-week growth spirt.  Beware though that the solubility of Miracle Grow is a mixed-blesssing, if you feed your garden in the morning, an afternoon shower can wash all the Miracle Grow away before your plants have a chance to absorb most of the nutrients.  So, I suggest using Miracle Grow at least once-a-week in the spring when your plants are growing rapidly.  Later in the summer, when growth slows and rain is frequent, reduce the feeding schedule to one every two to four weeks.  Toward the Fall, a maintenance feeding once a month may be advisable.  Most professional gardeners discourage Fall feeding, on the theory that dormancy should be encouraged to avoid frost damage.  Depending on your situation, your feeding schedule might be different.  Here in tropical South Florida, the dry season sets-in in the Fall and the plants come out of their Summer torpor, so that's when I step-up my feeding schedule.  If your Springs are cool and misty---once every two weeks may be adequate. In the northeastern States, I suspect that weekly feeding all Summer long would be desirable.FOLIAR FEEDINGPart of the whole point of Miracle Grow is foliar feeding---that plants will absorb nutrients through their leaves faster than via their roots---but the leaves can only absorb a little at a time.  So foliar feeding needs to be light and frequent.  Light frequent foliar feeding (even daily) is most effective in which it rains frequently during the growing season, washing nutrients out of the upper soil layer.  Orchids are best feed sprayed daily with a weak foliar solution.DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS FOR DIFFERENT PROBLEMSDespite all the shortcomings of Miracle-grow feeders, they remain the best solution for fertilizing home vegetable or flower gardens.  Trees, hedges, and lawns are best feed inexpensive dry granular 10-10-10 fertilizer, well watered in.  Orchids and delicate indoor flowers are best sprayed (with a pump-up or squeeze bottle sprayer) with a weak solution (1 teaspoon/gallon) of liquid Miracle Grow.  New plants are best started with slow-release fertilizer pellets mixed in with the soil.
B000OWF97S have a couple different seeds planted already. One has already popped up. Not sure if that's due to the dirt, but i'm happy.
B000OWF97S This seed starting potting soil is great for seeds and for rooting cuttings.  It is light and airy and roots can develop nicely.  Plant seedlings need air to grow properly.  It is clean, sterile and without fungus.  Fungus can cause damping off disease which usually kills the plant.  I would recommend this mix.
B000OWF97S If you like using Jiffy-Mix seed starting mix, comparison shop.  Even your local home center probably has it available cheaper.
B000OWF97S The price is great but found this easy to use and my plants doing great. So glad I got it.
B000OWF97S I keep herbs in my kitchen year round and this soil works very well for me. I start seeds in the little Jiffy wafers and set them in a larger container of the starting mix. I use grow lights because I don't have good light in my kitchen. This winter I am adding some wonderful pepper plants I am starting now.I'll trasfer them to 4 inch pots, keep them under the lights until Spring and set out the plants, along with tomatoes I'll start later. It is very nice and easy to work with this soil. It is light and holds moisture very well. I have good luck with it.
B000P0DK1Q BROKE
B000P0DK1Q + Does the job, mixes feed decently with water if you don't tilt/shake it around too much.- Very on/off trigger, wish it was more progressive or had a light setting for smaller plants.  Seems like it's made for large coverage and or large plant watering.-Leaks slightly in a couple areas, around the head and somewhere around the trigger, but not terrible.Overall, glad I got it, does the job.
B000P0DK1Q I bought this not for the fertilizer that comes with it I use that regularly anyway and have been using the fertilizer this review is not about the fertilizer I love there fertilizer and usually I love all there products however the Garden feeder I am not impressed with and there are cheaper and better feeders on the market. I will list by number the things I found wrong with this particular feeder.1.  Pressure is not very good on any of the settings.2.  Dispenses product unevenly3.  Dispenses product to fast or to slow or not at all4.  Have to turn upside down at times to get product to come out even after it is mixed really well5.  The setting spin on the front the dial does more harm then good at letting the water out in a certain way6.  No hose or tube inside the bottle or bowl area to pull product through everything is based on how much water is in bowl.Ok to be fair these are the positives1.  Light weight2.  Arrived on time3.  Does come with Miracle product inside of it ready to go.4.  The water shut off Does work ok5.  The product shut off to allow only water to get through works OK also.As I said I love and I use Miracle grow however I am not at all impressed with this dispenser and or there liquid dispenser. For a company that puts so much hard work into a great product to help plants grow you would think they would put more effort and ideas into how to dispense the product onto the plants and not sell cheap stuff at a higher price.Two stars because it showed up early and I like that that is one star, it was packaged well and arrived brand new, that is two stars. Did come with product inside that I love and it does not leak and it did put the product onto my garden even if I did not like the way it did it so that is the third star.I finally had to downgrade this to a two star, wow I really do not like this product. It leaks now and it is not that old, does not dispense evenly, I tried my best at giving it time and seeing if I would like it but I do not.Hope this helps anyone looking.
B000P0DK1Q I just used it again this afternoon. It is simple, durable, and does the job remarkably well when used with the ready-made packets in Scotts Company Miracle Gro All Purpose Plant Food and Miracle-Gro 1001832 Lawn Food Box, 5-Pound container. I just noticed Miracle-Gro is part of the Scotts company which explains much. Also, the price is right--I'd actually pay a little more for the sprayer and food.
B000P0DK1Q This review applies to ALL Miracle-Gro brand fertilizer-feeders, includingMiracle-Gro 100410 Lawn and Garden FeederMiracle-Gro 101411 LiquaFeed Starter KitMiracle-Gro 101411 LiquaFeed All Purpose Plant Feeding SystemandMiracle-Gro 100511 LiquaFeed Advance Starter KitI totally agree with ALL of you who have posted on the \"rip-off\" index of these products. My \"other half\" bought these one of each type at local home improvement warehouse on two different occasions thinking how easy it would be to use. She did not realize how EXPENSIVE it would be for the LiquaFeed Kits, it just looked EASY. Not only are the refill cartridges costly, the things LEAK, don't dispense evenly and is basically garbage! (Maybe she has learned on 2nd time around, then again ... )Miracle-Gro bulk granular water soluble fertilizers of various types are great! I have never burned any plants with them (see note below) and have healthy excellent looking flowers, plants and few veggies. But Miracle-Gro equipment is JUNK, including this item and Miracle Gro Lawn & Garden Feeder Miracle-Gro 100410 Lawn and Garden Feeder.  They are made of BRITTLE plastic, as I stated LEAK, do not mix & dispense fertilizer well, and break easily.AVOID these products.( NOTE: I do apply in cool of morning or after sunset here in HOT central Texas, and after going around fertilizing ALL plants, come back and \"mist off\" any fertilizer that may still be too concentrated on leaves and water plants. )
B000P0DK1Q This carries the Miracle-Gro name, so I expected it to be good stuff, in spite of the low price.  It does work well, but my water pressure blew out the first one I bought (locally), so I had to get a pressure-reducing coupler--not a big deal--and now this sprayer works fine.
B000P0FHQ2 STARTED GROWING CLOVER?
B000P0FHQ2 This lawn food has worked great bringing my lawn back to life. after getting the weeds under control with a different product, this fertilizer has brought back the lush green color my lawn should have! As others have noted though, it takes many applications before you see the results and often you can find this stuff much cheaper in your local brick and mortar stores. I have found it for about 9 bucks at my local walmart.
B000P0FHQ2 If you get this and the sprayer (Miracle-Gro 100410 Garden Feeder, Ready-to-Use Solution, 1-Pound) you can do your whole lawn in just a few minutes with excellent results. This container has 4 packets. You open the durable, extremely simple and easy-to-use sprayer, put in one packet, and spray. No ratios, no guesswork, no nothing but pleasant results. I believe I love the darn things.... The lawn does, anyway.
B000P0FHQ2 My front yard has only a couple inches of top soil covering crappy clay. It literally died last year in a horrible heat wave and drought, and did not come back this Spring. I dethatched and replanted it. After the new grass germinated and was a few weeks old, I applied this lawn food generously with a sprayer.One month later, I have a thick, beautiful, dark green lawn. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to conclude that the grass LOVED this product. I'll have to wait and see how long it stays happy, but I wouldn't hesitate to buy this again.
B000P0FHQ2 This product seems to be very effective in &#34;greening up&#34; the lawn, and it is certainly easy to apply.  HOWEVER, I must comment on the Miracle-Gro  sprayer I purchased to apply the lawn food (there are very few sprayers which will accept a granular product and dilute it in the sprayer).  I went through two of them before--both started leaking profusely out the business-end of the sprayer the first time I used them.  It finally dawned on me that my water pressure was too high for the sprayer (100 psi), and, upon disassembling one of the units, I discovered that a small O-ring in the valve had been displaced by the pressure.  I purchased a pressure-reducing adapter (from Amazon) which lowered the pressure and solved the problem.  I had to buy a third sprayer and it worked just fine.  I also re-glued the one I had disassembled, and now IT works well, also.
B000P1TB9K I think this Aspects 182 Super Dome Humbrella for Bird feeders by Aspects is about double the price I would have liked to pay, but this Humbrella Dome for Bird Feeder is just what I need to keep the squirrels out of my feeder. The price of feed saved will pay for it over one season and I won't have to cringe when I look out and see one of the little fuzzy tails hanging upside down from my feeder. Works well and is a sound product which offers: Classic styling for easy cleaning and refilling: Strong polycarbonate construction is leak proof and drip resistant and has a Bee Resistant design and built-in ant moat.
B000P1TB9K I bought this to add to my squirrel proof feeder (other review). Wish I had bought it from day 1 because the squirrels had already chewed parts of that feeder, and this prevents squirrels from sliding onto ANY feeder....they slip right off.....clear plastic has not discolored and does its job. Birds linger on the feeder when it's raining since they keep dry....
B000P1TB9K Squirrels learned in a few days how to get around this.  I wasted my money but you don't have to.
B000P1TB9K A good squirrel baffle actually serves two purposes being directly over a feeder.  It hopefully keeps the pesky varmints that its designed to deter away, and it also serves as a roof in keeping rain and whatnot away from the seed portals and helps them stay dry.  There are people that buy baffles as protection from the weather even if they are fortunate enough not to be bothered by squirrels.  The Aspects dome is certainly big enough to do both jobs.  But it is no more effective than any other baffle of the same size and design that is much cheaper.  If one sets out to buy a baffle just about anywhere of the dome variety, they will get a swift and severe education as to how expensive they are.  You will come to believe that all baffles must have uranium in them somewhere to be so overpriced.  The only exception to that rule that I have come across is the dome that can be found at a local Tractor Supply company, or at the Tractor Supply website.  They sell a full 15\" gray plastic dome squirrel baffle for the unbelievable price of only $8.00.  (At the time of this writing.  It my be a little more now, but will forever be far cheaper than the Aspects).  They are the same size as the Aspects and have the same double hook system.  And they also come with an attachment for mounting the baffle on a pole if that serves your needs. They are so cheap and effective I ordered 6 of them at once for all my feeders.  The only difference between the two is the Tractor Supply baffle is a solid gray instead of clear.  Something I actually prefer since the clear ones only look clear for the first couple of Weeks anyway.  From that time on they are never clear again.  If you're in the market for a baffle, especially for more than one, forget this horrendously overpriced Aspects model and check out the squirrel baffles at Tractor Supply company.  You will be most pleased I believe... : )
B000P1TB9K Very well made, not \"cheap, thin, brittle plastic\".  Quite attractive, actually....but most importantly, keeps those annoying tree rats (squirrels) out of my bird feeders.
B000P1TB9K This is one of my favorite domes because it is 18 inches in diameter. (Wide domes offer more protection.) The polycarbonate is thick and the hangers are heavy duty. It's durable. My only complaint is that the top screw hook is too long. Feeders need to be high enough off the ground so that feeding birds are safe from cats.This particular dome works best on feeders that have a ring or very short hook on top. A ring or  short hook allows the dome to almost rest on top of the feeder, and that's the way it protects the birds and seeds. In the photo displayed in this listing, the feeder has a tall bail for hanging. The dome hooks on the bail. But see how this makes the dome sit WAY above the feeder? That's not good because it exposes both the birds and seed ports to rain and snow. This style feeder needs the Aspects 351 Super Tube Top II or any dome that has a slit across the top that is wide enough to go over a bail in a way that the dome rests directly on top o the feeder. Look at the Aspects 351 Super Tube Top II and you'll see what I mean. Whatever you buy, make sure that the opening at the top of the dome will fit the hook, eye or bail on your feeder.
B000P1TB9K We have lots of squirrels and I have fought many the battle to save my feeders.  Purchased this as my last attempt before just giving in and giving up on feeders.  This is a miracle!  They all have tried to get to several different styles of feeders under this dome and NONE have made it.  They have given up and now my feeder is safe and full for the birds.  Birds were a bit confused at first since it is quite large, but only took a few days and now they're loving it as well.
B000P1TB9K I live in Florida, a state that experiences almost daily monsoon like weather every day during the summer, with horizontal rain being common at least a few times a week. I purchased my first as a rain guard to keep my feeder dry.The reason it looks silly is because I have various Brome Bird Feeders which are quite long (12 to 18&#34;) and while the dome is super wide, it doesn't look like it will do anything. Then the rain will begin, my Florida wide gutters straining to handle the rain, but the dome &#34;appears&#34; to be blocking the rain. Immediately after the rain stop, I stick my fingers into each port to test the dampness of the seeds. To my surprise, they were fully dry. I tested this on one of our rainiest summers. Note - I do take my bird feeders down during severe hurricanes, but it did handle a record breaking 22&#34; of water in a 24 hour time period.When I purchased future bird feeder, I ordered an additional super dome. Combing the cost of this pricey dome plus a good feeder (Brome in my case), it can really hurt one's pocket book,  but it is hard to argue with success - on an almost daily basis I see feeding: 3 red bellied woodpeckers, 4 cardinals, 40 golden finches, 2 bluejays, and the random mocking bird or robin.
B000P1TB9K Compare this to the Tube Top Dome, 12&#34; Clear version available here on Amazon.  Notice how the handle goes through the dome on that one, compared to attaching to a hook on this one.  The closer your feeder is to the dome, the better it will be protected.  Just an observation that may help you with your selection process.
B000P71GLU I love this thing.  Without bending over I can make holes in seconds even in hard packed dirt, then just plug in the little plants and you're done.  I have lots of tree roots to contend with and with this tool, I know right away if the spot I've picked is suitable or if a large root lurks below the surface and I should move my hole a couple of inches.  The hole this unit makes is ideal for the small plants in flat trays--and of course, bulbs.  For larger sized plants, I can make several holes right together or just wiggle the auger to enlarge the cavity and so far have been able to make holes for plants in pots up to 3\" pretty easily.  I wish I'd discovered this thing years ago.  It makes spring planting soooo much easier.
B000P71GLU I have just about worn out the auger that I purchased here.  I started out planting bulbs.  Then found it was an easy was to collect soil samples several inched deep in untilled soil, was good to drill holes for installing deep tree watering ports and turning my compost pile.  It has worked for me in loose/loamy soil, southern red clay and rocky southern red clay.  It has done the job in all (using an 18 v drill).Advice:  If drilling into moist clay soil, it tends to drill straight down like a screw.  I have to hold it back to auger the damp clay out of the hole.After hundreds of holes, the lower half has worn to a cone but still works well.
B000P71GLU I had only one use for this digger and that was to help aerate the yard.  Red clay compacts easily and makes grass growing close to impossible without aeration.  Renting those big bulky machines is O.K. but I wanted something like this and this is fantastic.May 17, 2012 added:  Please add young trees to the list of Bye, Byes.  About now the Red Bud Trees have started growing to about 1' to 2' and they can really take hold in the soil.  I attacked them with the Yard Butler and by golly they are gone with a few turns and NO bending or backaches.  I continue to be delighted with this tool and it is always ready to use.The length (30\") reduces the need to bend down.  The hole diameter is better than the smaller types and works beautifully in most soils.  Rocks are a nag and depending on the torque set on the drill the Yard Butler will stop when they are too thick or not worthy of messing with the drill's abilities.  If the rock is too large perhaps digging it out would be more satisfactory.  My attitude is dig a hole as deep as it can go and the rest will take care of itself.  My initial trip at drilling the yard centered on bare spots and I drilled holes about 2\" to 3\" apart to cover the hole.  Return trips included inspections to find other weak grass spots with the objective of reducing the compaction.  So far so good.  Not much apparent wear on the drill yet.The best part of this gem is the \"weed attacker\" aspects.  Put the point on the crown of the weed and turn the drill on.  The tool literally winds the weed onto the tool and all I have to do is take the weed off the tool.  Gone are the roots and the weeds.  So far I have only used this on mostly chick weed and one or two dandelions.  Earlier applications of weed killer eliminated most of the dandelions but like MacArthur, they will return.Great tool for exactly what it is to be used for.  Thanks for making my life a little easier.
B000P71GLU I have the shorter version of this roto digger, but needed the extra length for my back, what a great back saver this is. I use this for annuals also so I don't have to bend so much. Love, Love, Love.
B000P71GLU I got this to do some spot holes in my rather hard packed lawn and it is perfect. I use it to make &#34;spot&#34; areas to overseed grass,I drill a series of shallow holes close together, spread the seed, the cover over.a lot eaiser than doing the whole lawn.note that you will need a 3/8 inch drill.Mine has an adjustable torque, so I can set it and if the drill gets bogged down, it just will stop, then I can reset and start again.
B000P71GLU With almost 400 bulbs and perennials to plant I knew my spade would not hold up (or my back).  Popping this little guy on the end of my drill made the job a breeze.  Be careful to set your clutch low enough that you don't twist your wrist off should it hit a rock or hard spot.  400 holes and it still digs like it did on the very first hole.  This is one of my better purchases this year; really don't know why on earth I hand dug holes when for under 15 bucks I could have saved myself the trouble.  If you're a gardener, and don't have one -- buy this now.  Your only regret will be that you didn't get one sooner.
B000P7345G This is the only MG fert with Magnesium in the mix natively. It really does a good number as a General Purpose Fert for anything that likes a balanced diet ... Oh and Tomatoes really do like this one over the 24-8-16 mix which will just leave them flowering into October ... IHMO. ( Too much N compared to P and K you see, for a matto to go all the way. 18-20-21 is about perfect. )
B000P7345G This is the best fertilizer to supplement your container grown tomatoes.  Dissolve in water and feed every 7-14 days.  Special formula designed for tomatoes.  Contains Magnesium which helps prevent blossum end rot in tomatoes.
B000P7345G Yes, I know that too much watering makes your tomatoes a bit dull tasting.  So, I knew better than to over-water.  But, the fruit was just not quite as tasty as other years.  We routinely apply the Miracle Gro liquid fertilizer for vegetables, but something was missing.  So, I tried this fertilizer, and there was a marked improvement in taste.  Great product!  I just wish they made this in the bottled form that screws into the sprayer they sell for attaching to a hose.  It would be so much easier.  Maybe next year....
B000P7345G I have used Miracle Grow all year and my yields for all veggies and tomatoes are very high and the growth of my tomatoes is unbelievalbly big.
B000P7345G Plant food was shipped quickly, received in good order. If it is as good as Miracle Gro was in the past, I should have some outstanding plants and tomatoes. Good idea to put the food in &#34;ready to install packets&#34; in the sprayer. If you don' have the sprayer,just use one tablespoon per gallon of water and mix. Easy, huh? When feeding, be sure to wet the leaves as well as around the plant, since tomatoes absorb the nutrients through both areas.
B000P7345G This is a God send for all plants. It nourishes even dieing plants back to life. I would but it again.
B000P7345G REVISION: Below I said to stop using Nitrogen later in the season, but I have had to adapt that recommendation.  Over the last two years, early blight has stricken tomatoes nation wide, including places where it was relatively rare like New England.  Entire farms have been wiped out, especially organic farms.Early blight can be treated with a fungicide, but you need new stem and leaf growth to compensate for the leaves and stems lost to blight.  You will have a smaller crop at the end, but losing the plant will result in many fewer tomatoes.I found after several of my plants succumed to blight (no tomatoes, a couple of branches of leaves, etc.) that providing the rest a good dose of late season nitrogen helped them enormously.So, I would suggest now, until the early blight has run its course (maybe never) you should use Miracle Grow Tomato Plant Fool all season and don't try to overinduce the flowering and yield of your tomatoe plants.  Two live healthy plants with average yield are way better than one dead one killed off by blight.Watch for youtubegarden.com, for more info.--------------------------------------------------I always plant with manure (raked into the soil, about one 25 pound bag of dehydrated manure per 10 plants, about 2 feet apart and spaced 3 feet per row) and some fresh garden top soil (just placed in the hole where the plant is, not throughout the garden).If you remember, it is good to mix in lime as well about a month or so before you put the tomatoes in the ground.  It helps by providing calcium to the plants and helps prevent blossom end rot.  Although, I rarely have had any problem with that here, it can depend on your soil, so better safe than sorry.  If you forget, don't worry, things will work fine without it for the most part.I plant the tomatoes deep, relative to the size of the plant.  1/3 down into the soil or more depending on the size.  Before I do I place fresh garden top soil in the hole and water it.  Then I place the plant firmly in the muddy mixture and surround it with more fresh garden top soil.  I have not found that different brands of gardening soil are better, so any cheap bag at your local gardening shop will do.  I have never lost a plant doing this.  People talk about other ideas like using 80 degree water to water the plants or using special techniques to keep from hurting the plants.  But I have never used any technique like this.  Hose water is fine as is rain water.I do not fertilize my tomatoes until a couple of weeks have passed and they have rooted and grown a bit.  I let the manure, new garden soil and lime do the job.After that, every two weeks, I apply Miracle Gro, and when I do, the plants are more vigorous, grow faster and I have fewer problems with the plants such as discolorations of the leaves or bug infestations.  I have heard numerous folks say to use less or more than the directions, but you know, the 1 Table Spoon per Gallon of water always has worked for me.  About a gallon for every three plants when they are young.  A bit more when they get to be 2 feet or more.  The box does twenty plants for the period of the season I use it.I use a bucket or watering can for mixing.  I have not had good luck with the automatic dispensers attach to the end of the hose and it seems to waste fertilizer.  But your mileage may vary.When the plants first start to show fruit and have reached about 3 feet, I stop using Miracle Gro and switch to a no-nitrogen fertilizer.  I find that by the time the plants are 3 feet tall, their root growth is fantastic and their leaf production is strong, so I want to focus on flowering and fruit production.  Something that reads 0-10-10 or even higher is fine.  Just absolutely no nitrogen.I have tried other fertilizers for my plants.  Nothing has worked better than Miracle Gro and some brands seemed to not work at all.  I have always been satisfied with Miracle Gro and stick to it for great tomatoes and strong plants.
B000P7345G Buying from Amazon with prime has really made shopping at local stores far and few between. I order this product from Amazon every year. This stuff will help and make you look like a person with a real green thumb for gardening. Just use one table spoon per gallon of water and pour. Use it every two weeks. You will be blown away how your tomato plants will blossom and grow. I didn't use it on two of the same kind of plants to see if I could tell the difference. Trust me on this..... Those two were half the size as the plants I used this on. So I know this product works better than it says it does. Try it and you will be amazed how good it honestly really works!!!
B000P7345G I like this because I can mix up a batch and use it any way I want. Spray, soak or dunk this is easy to use.  You don't need much of it so the 3lb bag will be in use next year too.  I'll buy more when this runs out, in a year or two. You know the only way I dont use this is in the hose sprayer it's made for.  I don't think it would last as long burning a bag that way.
B000P7345G I used this on my tomato plants and they seem to respond well to this treatment. You have to use it every week, but it doesn't take much and with last me this season.
B000P7FVX4 Bought this to use as a roof sunshade and a privacy shade on a side of the deck close to our neighbors house. Doubled up it functions *alright* as a privacy shade, and certainly more economic then any other options. As a sunshade for a roof you couldn't ask for more. It really does not reduce light visibility that much and you get the hot sun off of you. You can buy clips and fasteners for it from plenty of places, I just went with wood staples and they work great - no tears/rips or any issues otherwise. All in all a great product that I would recommend.
B000P7FVX4 This stuff is great.I installed some on top of my pergola.  I simply nailed the cloth into the boards with several dozen roofing nails.  We've had severe weather, hail, drought, and the fabric looks exactly as it did when I installed it.It definitely provides effective protection from the sun, though I did wind up modifying the design of the pergola to better position more fabric in the best spots.The price is hard to beat, and the stuff is forgiving and easy to work with.
B000P7FVX4 Easy to cut (minimal fraying), easy to sew (fold over once and stitch), and the selvedge edge is bound neatly.This 64-70% shade version is great for shading vegetable beds in very hot summer sun.  I attached it to my PVC shade structures with PVC grip clamps and they hold onto the fabric marvelously.
B000P7FVX4 good quality... holding up good so far. will update later if anything happens. i want more of this but at a cheaper price. i'm glad i bought it when i did.
B000P7FVX4 I have a deck with a high roof that at times in the day produces a lot of glare.  Shades work well for the 8 feet between a support beam and the deck floor.  We cut this to fit the top triangle above the support beam.  It does an excellent job of blocking the sun.  We have stapled it into place.  It is porous enough to allow for excellent air flow and has not torn or come lose even on windy days.Very please with this product.  I also have deck shades by the same company and am thrilled with them as well.
B000P7FVX4 Maybe I should have bought the \"authorized\" hanging tools but I used grommets and the fabric is ripping at that point from the wind blowing.  I am concerned about making it more secure as I am not sure if it will rip more if it cant move or rip more if its whipping around.But I do like the look of the fabric and that I can still see out through the fabric.  I would buy it again but have to get a better way of securing it and/or not use it in a windy area (not sure where that would be considering its designed purpose).
B000P7FVX4 I got a roll to cover my small patio.  It blocks the sun well, is sturdy. It is for sure worth it to get this product.
B000P7FVX4 We cut to shape and installed on the underside of our lattice patio cover to further block the sun.  It does a fine job.  Wanted something easily removable when wisteria covers the top and provides natural shade.
B000P9URDQ I bought three different kinds of mouse traps for some mice that have found a way into our home. I set it up last night and sure enough shortly after I went to bed I heard the SNAP! Dead mouse. Unfortunately this trap is a pain in the butt to set. There is a little plastic hook that holds the metal spring down and it just doesnt want to stay. After playing with it for a while I manage to get it to hold but I do wish it was a bit easier to set.
B000P9URDQ These traps are really effective; you place a small amount of bait (I use peanut butter applied with a toothpick) in a little bait-cup, close the cover, and slowly move the set-lever back until it locks.  Unlike traditional spring-traps there is no way I can see that you would accidentally snap your finger, unless you have them sticking into the entrance.  Getting it to lock  can be a little tricky, you really do have to move the lever down slowly.I think the secret to these traps is the mouse has only one way to approach the bait, so he goes down the little hallway and is lined up head-first and SNAP!, no more mouse.  I've caught two mice in the same night with the same bait.Update 09/2012:  I've been through a few of these traps over the years, sometimes the trap is in a rarely-visted place and the dead mouse gets nasty by the time I find it so I just throw the whole trap away.  I see these traps have gotten cheaper but a couple of the new ones I bought have broken after 1 or 2 uses, a little plastic piece breaks and you can't set the trap.  I tried to fix it using Gorilla Glue but without success.  Hopefully this isn't a trend.
B000P9URDQ A feature of this trap is \"never have to touch a dead mouse!\"  I find that pretty pathetic, because if you can't go through the trouble of putting on a pair of gloves then... I won't go into that.  Yes this trap catches mice, but it also catches and kills chipmunks and other rodents that do not create problems for humans.  The trap uses a conventional spring set arm that crushes the animal quickly and is therefore more humane than other traps. The problem with this mechanism is that it can crush the animal into a mess.  Maybe some people would get a kick out of that, but I don't. The most selective and humane way to trap is to use a Havahart trap, then euthanize only the problem animals with ether (found as \"starting fluid\" in automotive stores).  Ether is a potent anesthetic which was used on humans in early medical procedures.  It's also extremely flammable so take great care.
B000P9URDQ We live on a large lot that borders a freeway.  Some years we have trouble with mice in the fall and no longer have any cats.  We used glue traps for years.  Although they work fairly well, you still have to actually kill the mouse once it's trapped.We won't use poisons for several reasons and don't want to use the old fashioned, open snap traps because they present a danger to our small dog and us.I ordered two of these traps, which arrived quickly.  One of them was defective, but the other has proven to be very efficient.  I wish we didn't need it at all, but it works very well and is reusable.You can dispose of the already dead mouse without ever having to touch it and easily reset the trap.
B000P9URDQ So far I have spent $50 on two electronic zapper traps that my mice managed to enter, eat the bait, and leave (sans zap) and; $30 on four of these traps which the mice have thus far simply ignored leaving the bait behind (peanut butter) along with some mouse poop left right nearby as an F/U to me letting me know they were there and that they weren't falling for my traps.My mice have no reason to suspect traps as I have thus far relied on my two cats to keep the house mouse free and it hasn't been an issue for years. That is if you don't count the occasional mouse corpse left diligently just outside the bedroom door for me to walk on half-asleep the morning after the kill...Then recently I started noticing mouse poop but no mouse corpses and assumed the cats were't keeping up their side of the deal. So, loving electronic toys, I got the expensive Thomas Edison style electrocution mouse traps which failed, followed by these which also failed. So I guess the little critters are smarter than I thought and the cats are back on Tuna.I gave it two stars instead of one because they appear well made for the money and I still think they look likely to do the trick if your mice are of the low IQ variety.In any case these are batting a zero so far but are still baited as are the zappers. Time to try something else.I promise to update this if they ever come through.UPDATE: A month and a half into this one of the D-Con's came through and I got a mouse using peanut butter.  Bumped these up to three stars.  Only three because I still have mice...Update#2: These traps = 4 kills - Zapper traps = 2 kills. I appear to be mouse free now. Cats are fired!
B000P9URDQ I've caught many mice with this trap. This is just the traditional trap with a cover so you don't have to see the dead body, just the tail. What else can I say? I've caught at least a dozen mice with this. Very occasionally the mouse will clean up the peanut butter without setting off the trap but I just bait it again. About 3 times, the mouse turned around and set it off facing out. I have no idea why a mouse would back into it, but the trap killed it all the same. The entry hole is pretty big so that it can catch some pretty big mice.
B000P9URDQ I bought two of these traps, and the first night, I caught a mouse.  I also purchased two other types of traps for comparison, and think I will continue to purchase these when I need to.  I love that you can set these with one hand.  When the mouse is caught, you don't have to see it, just lift up the flap, and push the lever to release the mouse into the garbage.  Then it is really easy to reset.  I am really excited to catch another mouse now!  Sadly it's been two weeks since I caught the first mouse, and I am beginning to think I only had one mouse. I highly doubt that, but I will be grateful if I only have one.
B000P9URDQ Didn't like it, returned it, it didn't work at all.  I trap mice all the time in the metal wire cages, and this caught nothing.  Sorry, charlie--useless to me.
B000P9URDQ I ordered 4 of these traps after I saw a little mouse run across the garage floor. I used a pea-sized dab of peanut better for bait, as recommended in the instructions, then set two in the garage along a wall and the other two in our basement storage area, where I noticed some mouse droppings earlier.The next morning the two traps in the garage each had a mouse - and today (the second morning) there was another mouse in one of the basement traps.It is sort of gross to see the mouse's hind-end sticking out of the trap, but I used a bag for each to pick them up and then tied it shut and took it outside to the trash. I know the instructions said the traps are reusable (which they are) but I guess I'm a wimp -- I'd rather order new ones (which I just did). But if you wanted to reuse the traps it is very easy to do so -- you can release the snap mechanism without touching the mouse.The only (very minor) thing was that three of the traps set on the first try but the last one was a little tricky - I had to repeatedly mash down the lever to get it to set. And then if I even bumped it the trap snapped shut - on a hair trigger. But I finally got it in place along a wall in the basement and set it (that is the one that caught the mouse last night).I also have 4 of the round-type of traps that are designed to close when a mouse enters -- you can't see the mouse if it's inside but will know one is in there because the spring-mechanism moves from \"set\" to \"caught.\" So far those haven't caught any mice  so looks like I'll stick with the product on this page. Glad to get rid of those mice.
B000P9URDQ The hook that holds the metal bar in place doesn't work on mine. I know that if I didn't have a defective trap, it would have probably worked... but who knows with my mouse. It's managed to set off but avoid 1 Snap-E trap and 3 ordinary d-Con wooden traps. I was hoping this would do the trick, as I've had to move the food in my cupboards and pantry twice and tape up any and all openings, no matter how small and it seems to be working. I guess I'll have to manage life with a mouse in my kitchen. I don't want to use poison because the mouse hides in places I can't get to and I don't want it's dead body stinking up my house.
B000P9URDQ I hate the idea that I have no choice than to kill, I tried the humane way for 5 years, but they are overunning my house, since I have chickens and mice are attracked to the feed etc.I bought several different types and the mice beat the trap and got away with the goods.  Not with this trap, I put it under the sink with some cheese I had left over and within ONE HOUR, no joke, I had a mouse, I was a little taken back to see his little legs and tail sticking out but I am sure he could not have suffered since this thing is quick.I will buy several more tomorrow now I can put them everywhere not being afraid it would hurt my dig or cat, yes I have a lazy cat. I had a terrier that brought me  mice on a regualr basis, she is gone now, guess that is why I have a problem.It is Oct.09 now and I am mouse free, I found their exit from the attic where they were making a home and making lots of noice. I placed the traps in their path under the sink.  This trap caught 14 mice in less than 2 weeks.  Unfortunately one was not killed and I feel bad about that, but he was not really hurt because he ran off outside. I also found a few in the garage.  Funny thing when you scare them away as long as you keep the traps open they will be afraid to come back, I think it is that way.
B000PBXESO We found the hummingbird feed very easy to set up. We mix our own sugar water and have lots of hummingbird visitors. We have enjoyed watching them as they use the feeder.
B000PBXESO With this feeder hanging outside my office window, I see hummers feeding on it all day long. It's easy to fill and hang, easy to take apart and clean, and the hummers can't get enough.Living in the southwest desert, the hummers around here have a particularly hard time finding fresh nectar sources throughout the year. It gets so hot here in the summer that the nectar in hummingbird feeders either ferments or completely dries up within 5-7 days. The feeders here need to be cleaned and filled with fresh nectar twice a week.With this feeder it's easy and painless to take down, clean and refill.The hanging hardware works well, everything seems to be fairly durable.I'm planning on ordering a second one soon, I could not be happier with the one I have.
B000PBXESO This is the best Hummingbird feeder I have ever purchased. I can actually fill it enough to leave it hanging for two weeks, even though I have more and more hummingbirds attending. The bottom has a built-in perch all the way around so the little guys can actually rest while they are drinking. What a concept! Very easy to fill and clean.
B000PBXESO I've got beautiful blown glass and antique glass bottle feeders I just adore, but none of them hold nearly as much nectar as this beast does.  Come the end of April, my swarm of hummers is back and hungry - I keep them all out and need to refill 5 feeders at least once per week.If your garden is heavily trafficked by humming birds, this feeder is great.  If not, the nectar may turn to vinegar before they finish it, so a smaller size or lower fill level might be better.  I never color the nectar (the red colorant chemicals can cause the laid eggs to be thinly shelled and easily broken).  The birds find the feeder by the bright red plastic dispensing bottom without complaint; no need to color the sugar-water.
B000PBXESO I bought 2 hummingbird feeders at the same time since the little cuties can be so aggressive. I bought 2 different brands. This one was my favorite at first as I liked the way it looked. However, its not going to hold up. The metal ring at the top is not attached in any way and the nectar bottle will fall through from time to time even though I don't even fill it half way. This has caused the plastic \"bowl\" at the bottom to break. This red plastic nectar holder is actually in 2 parts. One of the two pieces has broken slightly from all the falls to the ground. It is holding up for now...but will probably need to get tossed at the end of this season.If you're curious, the other feeder I purchased was this one: It is holding up much better...B00004RA8P
B000PBXESO This feeder isn't all designery like those made by Perky Pet, but hummingbirds seem to like it better, it cleans up reasonably well, and none of the materials are toxic to birds (no copper or zinc galvanization as seen on many other products).  There's no paint to peel off like has happened with the other brand, and the red color is what seems to attract hummers most reliably.
B000PBZFJK I have 3 feeders hanging on my deck - this is the &#34;go to&#34; one.  I don't know why, but I guess &#34;pretty&#34; has nothing to do with their choice!  Easy to clean, assemble.  No drips or spills.
B000PBZFJK These feeders are very well designed. I have 3 Best-1 feeders hanging outside my office window, I see hummers on them all day long. The feeders are easy to disassemble and clean, seem relatively durable (unless you drop them), and most importantly the hummers love them.I originally ordered and have been using the larger version of this feeder, theBest-1 32oz. Hummingbird Feeder. I was so happy with it that I decided to order two more.After trying the large 32oz. version I decided to go for the smaller 8oz. version, mainly because it gets so hot in the summer where I live. If I put the 32oz. feeder out full of nectar, it will ferment and go bad in just a few days, before the hummers can drink it all. The 8oz. version is exactly the same product but with a smaller bottle attached. The bases look identical and are the same size.The small bottle on the 8oz. version is easier to unscrew from the base, easier to clean, the hummers drink most or all of the nectar before it goes bad, and it's easier to see how much nectar is left in it.If you live in a cooler climate then the 32oz. version is probably a better choice because you can fill it up and leave it out longer, but if you live somewhere that gets hot enough that you have to change the nectar several times a week like I do, then these 8oz. bottles are the way to go.The hummers here in the southwest desert have a hard time finding fresh nectar in the summer, so it's really fun to set up a little sanctuary for them. These feeders are perfect for it.Hummingbird Nectar Mix======================For the nectar mix I am using 1 part sugar to 4 parts water, boiled then cooled. One drop of trace minerals added after the mix is cool. A great trace mineral to use isLiqumins ConcenTrace Trace Mineral Drops, Low Sodium, 8-Ounce Bottle.
B000PBZFJK Easy to clean and fill. I don't get a lot of hummingbirds but the ones I get are here year-round so I have 3 of these and they get plenty of use. I did have to order extra bases because some of them seem to break easily. The birds love having a place to perch as they feed.
B000PBZFJK I bought the one with the small bottle and refresh it twice a week, The birds love it. The ants love it too but it is a death trap for them. They tell me ants are high in protein?
B000PBZFJK This was my first hummingbird feeder that I have ever purchased.  Arrived as described, though it is smaller that I thought it would be.  Have already made food and have it hanging, just waiting for the birds!
B000PBZFJK I buy hummingbird feeders locally whenever there are end of season sales.  Six or seven hang out in our very large yard at any given time; we've gone through many different styles and brands.  Best-1 hummingbird feeders have held up the longest (7+ years) and seem to be the hummingbirds' favorite.  As a matter of fact, the only time one failed is when a raccoon tried to drink out of one, the feeder fell, and the glass bottle broke.  With any other, you'd have to throw the whole thing away.  No problem here--replacement parts are made and sold.These feeders can be found elsewhere at cheaper prices, and replacements for either the glass top or plastic bottom can be bought separately.  Look up Nottawa Wild Bird Supply (can be found online) in Indiana.  They sell this 8 oz. feeder for $8, the base replacement for $5, or the 8 oz. glass top for $3.  I stop in whenever I'm in the area--it's a birder's paradise.
B000PBZFJK The bottle is glass and I like that because glass clean easier than plastic.Haven't used it yet, but I like it because it's small and I got two of them so hummers have more to choose from
B000PGOON8 Given the cost of this unit, the water reservoir capacity, and the fact that it only fits certain types/sizes of pots, I think I'm better off just asking my neighbor to hit my fussier plants with some water from my hose if I'm going to be out of town for a week or more.
B000PGOON8 The instructions that come with the CobraCo Plant Sitter are terrible.  In order to make this product work, you must (1) fill the container with water (nothing else mixed in), (2) wet the ceramic cone, (3) fill the ceramic cone with water, (4) make sure the plastic tubing is at the bottom of the water container, (4) start the siphoning process, and (5) put the ceramic cone in the dirt up to the cap.The container is made for small rimmed pots only.  If you have a larger rimmed pot, you'll have to improvise or put the water container inside your pot.  The problem with putting the container inside of your pot is that the water will siphon out quicker than if hanging on the pot, so you'll need to monitor your plant to see if it is getting too much water.  The container is see-through, so you can eye-ball the water level easily, but it is made of plastic, so time will tell how durable it is.Overall, not a bad product.  An adjustable hanger would have been nice to have in order to use the system on different types of pots.
B000PGOON8 I tried this while out of town for six days and it did not seem to work. The soil was dry when I got back even though the plastic container was still full of water.Other reviewers have left tips that I should try. Maybe then it would work. But the system should work more simply than that; it is basically a water container and a wick. And it is not good-looking although it is not real ugly either.
B000PGOON8 The lid will not stay snapped shut, thus the suction needed to draw the water into the plant is not present.  Could not get it to deliver water to the planter.
B000PGOON8 The concept is a good one, however, it's a little bulky and ugly and will only work on certain pots.  The system is too big to work on anything less than 8\" tall.  If you have a decorative pot that has a thick rim (over 1\") or overly curved, this will not fit.  I would use this for plants if I was going to be away for a few weeks, but it isn't attractive enough to have on my pots year round.
B000PGOON8 I followed the instructions that accompanied this loser and the results were poor. The lid on the tank will not stay closed. I had planned to use this outside but without the lid staying shut this would be an excellent hangout for mosquitos so I left it outside for only about a week and a half. I dropped (pushed would be a better word) the \"hose\" through the hole in the lid. Instructions say insert it until the tip reaches the bottom. I pushed the entire \"hose\" through the hole and it never reached the bottom but remained suspended in the water about two thirds of the way down. The tank hangs on the side of the pot all lopsided and really looks as tacky as all getout. No water ever transferred from the tank to the flower pot during the week or so that I left it outside.Not sure where this was made although there is a USA address on the cardboard but it does not say \"manufactured in\". However I would not blame any manufacturer for not wanting to admit to making this butt-ugly and worthless recycling candidate.There has to be a much better offering of plant watering products than this. Look elsewhere for something that has at least a smidgeon of quality which this does not. Stay away from this - far, far away.
B000PGOON8 I have pretty much given up on the CobraCo 6000 Plant Sitter. The instructions that come with the plant are basically useless, leaving the user to try and figure out how to make this thing work. It seems simple enough. Fill the reservoir with water, connect the hose, and stick the watering thing in the dirt.But it isn't that simple. The water doesn't seem to flow on its own. I have tried several things, from mounting the reservoir at different heights and trying to \"prime\" the tubing with water, but nothing seems to work. I did read that there is a way to get it to work, but I had already given up at that point. It seems like if you are going to make a product that sells for $17 and the only thing it has to do is water a plant, that you would at least provide instructions on how to do the one thing it is made for.I can't give it 1 star because apparently some people have figured out how to make it work, and so apparently it isn't totally worthless. But for wasting my time, and frustrating me, I will give it 2 stars. I should also mention this thing is ugly and won't clip on to pots that have a thick rim, like some ceramic pots. It is also made of very cheap plastic, not high quality plastic like tupperware or rubbermaid products. Overall, this thing is not good and I do not recommend it.
B000PGOON8 As many have said, the lid will not stay shut which can impact the suction through the hose.  It is ok, but I believe that they could have made a higher quality version and charged more as there seems to be good demand for such a product.
B000PGOON8 I have to say that this little thing has worked wonderfully for me. I have read that it does not work for bigger plants but that works out for me since the one I use it on is a smaller one. It is very easy to use although you may have to figure it out yourself since some have had trouble with the instructions. Luckily everything was fine for me and this thing works. I am away from home a lot so this really works out well for me. I recommend this to any one with a plant in need.
B000PGOON8 I held great hopes for this gadget.  We have a 20-inch pot on our upstairs desk, containing a brugmansia.  We needed a plant there to shade the window, but it's a hassle keeping it watered. Perhaps this would cut down our daily watering to every other day.Unfortunately, it didn't work for this purpose.  The lid to the plastic container would not stay closed, so perhaps that's part of the problem.  Also, the curve of the plastic container wasn't wide enough to accommodate a a pot this size.  I tried sitting the container on the ground, though, and that didn't improve the function.Judging from another review here, I might be able to use the wired device in another container. But right now I don't have time to engineer that.Kudos to the manufacturer for the handy video instructions. Very clear.
B000PGOON8 This watering system only fits on medium/large sized pots, and I wouldn't recommend it for use as your sole watering system. However I have a bad habit of only watering my plants every few days, and this has worked well to pick up the slack in between.The design concept is interesting and quite functional, however the materials used are not particularly high quality. It would be a better use of money to create your own reservoir and purchase water sensors from CobraCo (CobraCo 6001-TC Replacement Ceramic Watering Sensors) or another company.
B000PGOON8 FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS, if you do that and pre-soak the ceramic spike, then fill the spike and the tank with water this system will work VERY well. I've been using the ceramic spike for years now and they have never failed me. Now they're just bundling the spikes with a water tank, which is convenient. This tank is probably only good for a few weeks with most plants, but you can use a bigger tank if needed. I've used up to a gallon tank without a problem.
B000PGOON8 I'm not the world's best organized as far as remembering to water my plants, so this plant sitter is ideal. I have it \"sitting\" a plant that's perched up on a high credenza in my office that I have to get up on a stool to water--- hence it sometimes gets missed. With the sitter I don't have to worry about it anymore--- I can see clearly from the tank when I need to replenish its water. Very handy for me and very pleased to have it.
B000PGOON8 The Plant Sitter is a product designed for those who'd like to have their plants watered automatically over a period of time. It contains a reservoir for the water and a ceramic sensor to trigger water release when the soil gets dry. You will need to carefully follow the instructions and test-run it to make sure it is properly watering your plants. Some users need to make adjustments to get it working sufficiently, such as changing the position of the reservoir, taping the lid closed, adjusting the sensor insertion spot, etc. It has a decent cosmetic appearance and hangs easily on most plant containers - I have a variety of potted plants on my patio and it fits a majority of them. It seems to usually work well when used as directed but there are exceptions and if you expect it to work fine for every plant and without any adjustment then you could have it ruin a plant. The mechanism for how this functions is simple enough that someone could create a similar system on their own using parts that are less expensive. Thus, if you have a lot of plants that need automatic watering it would be expensive to buy a lot of Plant Sitter packages - you'd probably want to find a more inexpensive system. Thus, I'd say this is an option for those with no more than a few plants that may need watering when there's temporarily no human around to do the job - and you should first test run it when you are around to ensure it is functioning as intended.
B000PGOON8 This arrived just as I was about to leave for four days, and the plant I most wanted to save was an outdoor potted plant. I knew this was not made for outdoor plants, but I figured I'd try anyway. That was a useless effort; I came back to find the tank completely dry and the plant dry, too... I guess the tank just evaporates easily in hot weather.Anyway, then I tried it for its intended use. I placed it in a small potted houseplant and it has watered for 7 days-- the soil is nice and moist and the tank is about halfway down, just as the literature says (up to 2 weeks of watering).PROS:-Works as intended-Camouflaged colors-- the green blends in with the plant, so it's not a big, obvious device-You can use it with your own water container, too, if you want something bigger (as long as the hose reaches the bottom)CONS:-Expensive. How many people have just one houseplant they want to save? At this price, you could rack up triple digit expenses just to keep your plants watered.-The top doesn't stay closed. You'd expect there to be a tab or something to keep it \"clicked\" closed, but nope. It just sits there. My cat hasn't knocked it over yet, but it's just a matter of time, I think.-Doesn't fit \"almost all\" containers as advertised. I've tried it on several small containers, and it doesn't stay on them. Not a big deal in my case, though, because my plants are on a countertop and I've just put the tank behind the plant instead of hanging from the side of the pot. Also won't work for hanging plants-- it tipped mine sideways from the weight.Overall: if you have just one or two indoor plants you really want to save while you're away, this could work well.
B000PGOON8 2nd UPDATE:The sensor was empty today. I thought I made a mistake the first time this happened. Since this has happened three times & the two sensors I've been using for years still have water in them, there must be something wrong with the Plant Sitter. I noticed that the Plant Sitter feeding tube is smaller in diameter than the sensors I've used for years. Maybe that's the problem. I don't know for sure, all I know is that the Plant Sitter sensor is not siphoning water like it should be.My rating went from 3 stars to 1 star.UPDATE:After setting this system up using 3 sensors (one that came with the plant sitter & two I previously owned), I thought everything was working normally. After a few days I checked each sensor again to be sure each was full of water. I was surprised that the sensor that came with the Plant Sitter was empty again. The other 2 sensors were full of water - like they're supposed to be. I soaked the empty sensor for 15 minutes then re-filled it with water. I will check in a few days to see if it is empty again. If so, I will update my review & reduce the star rating.~~~~~~~~~~~~~ORIGINAL REVIEWI've used self-watering probesSelf-Watering Probes - Package of 5for indoor & outdoor plants successfully for many years. I use gallon milk containers as the water reservoir.  The CobraCo 6000 Plant Sitter works the same way way as the ceramic probes I used in the past & it comes with its own 1 quart reservoir.To use self-watering ceramic sensors:~Remove cap~SOAK the ceramic cone/probe  10-15 minutes in water (Cobra forgot to add this important step to its product label instructions)~Fill the cone/sensor ALL the way to the top then recap it.~Push the ceramic sensor into the soil. I always make sure the ceramic portion is completely pushed into the soil.~Fill the reservoir with water.  To feed  your plants, add a little liquid fertilizer to the water.~Drop the feeding tube into the water reservoir making  sure it rests on the bottom. (For the Cobra Plant Sitter, drop the end of the tube through the center hole on the reservoir's lid)~Cover the top of the reservoir so that the water won't evaporate & so mosquitoes won't get in if you're using it outside. (The Plant Sitter has a lid, but the lid doesn't snap closed. To keep the lid closed, I put a rubber band around each side of the reservoir. If I was using the Plant Sitter outside, I would cover the center hole & the feeding tube with aluminum foil)~IMPORTANT: Always set your Plant Sitter up a week before you leave to be sure it's working properly. (I noticed that the water level in the reservoir hadn't changed in a week. I pulled the ceramic sensor out, removed the cap & saw the cone was completely empty...that's why it wasn't working. I filled it back up, put the cap back on, pushed the sensor back into the soil; by the end of the day, the reservoir's water level was going down)...see my UPDATEA few tips:~Larger plants will need at least two ceramic probes/sensors.~Depending on type, size & season, a plant will require from 8 ounces to 32 ounces of water weekly. I find that for my plant in a 6\" pot, the Plant Sitter's one quart reservoir will water it for approximately 2 weeks.~If you rely on the Plant Sitter to always water your plants, you should water the plant from the top once a month.~The level of the water in the reservoir should be below the cap on the ceramic sensor. Raising the reservoir increases the flow rate; lowering it reduces the flow.~If the reservoir runs out of water, you need to refill it & you will also need to refill the ceramic sensor.The Plant Sitter's reservoir is a nice translucent color, not flashy or showy, so it won't detract from your plant. It's too tall for some of my smaller indoor plants. So I sit it near the plant instead of hanging it on the pot.I added two more sensors & am using the Plant Sitter to water three plants at a time. The center hole is large enough for me to thread two feeding tubes through it, but I had to put the other tube under the lid; two rubber bands are holding the lid closed. I'm sure the reservoir will need to be filled  often, but the plants have been so thirsty lately that I haven't been watering them enough. I'm expecting happier plants by using the Plant Sitter.Amazon's product description is confusing to me. It mentions both a 1 quart reservoir & a 2 quart reservoir. I received a 1 quart reservoir & one ceramic sensor.Made in ChinaThis is a 4 star product, but I deducted 1 star because an important step was not included on the product's label instructions & the lid doesn't snap closed.~~~~~~~~
B000PGOON8 This device is designed to provide you plants with consistent water over a couple weeks, like when you go on vacation. Now the water reservoir is rather cheaply made. The lid does not close properly, I had to place a rock on it to keep it closed. Now if you look above, you can get the Hydrospikes by themselves and use almost any bottle or jug with them. This model works best when you don't have any place for that jug as it attaches to the side of the flower pot. You can also use multiple hydrospikes to one jug to water multiple plants or one large pot.Now the one thing to keep in mind is that you do need to \"prime the pump\" by soaking the terracotta sensor and pouring water into the hydrospike to get the water flowing. You may also need to do this occasionally if the water stops or runs out for any reason.If you have a lot of flower pots, are forgetful when it comes to watering and especially if you have a tendency to over water your plants, then this is a great tool for keeping your plants healthy and alive.
B000PGOON8 The Plant Sitter Automatic Watering System is really just a simple water siphon consisting of three parts: A curved reservoir that can hang on the side of a pot or stand free, a thin coiled hose, and a pours ceramic cone (they call it a \"sensor\") attached to one end of the hose. Setup is simple: FIll the tank, soak the \"sensor\" in water until well saturated (this takes 10-15 minutes), insert the sensor in the soil, and you're done. The ceramic cone is the key here. From what I can tell, It prevents dirt and particles from being drawn back into the hose, plugging it, and it provides a lot of surface area to help draw water into the pot while preventing the siphon from immediately draining the reservoir.I set up my Plant Sitter in a 12\" pot containing a few ivy cuttings I'm starting. I've placed the pot on my side porch, where it'll get sunlight but will be sheltered from the rain.  Everything appears to be properly configured according to the instructions. We'll see how it looks when I return from my vacation next week.
B000PGOON8 I tried this in my guest room, where I have a few plants that get forgotten. After following the directions, I put this into a pot of Emerald Gem that had been recently divided from the mother plant. It was doing great because I was remembering to water it.This watering system didn't work well. A month after installing, there was still water in the well. The plant was very droopy. I'll try again with a different plant and see if I get better results.
B000PGOON8 I am evaluating this product winter 2013 when indoor environment is extremely dry. The houseplant sits facing Southern window connected with the watering system. Instructions are so easy to follow. I fill the reservoir and ceramic sensor with luke-warm water. The system does the watering for me. In about two weeks, I re-fill the reservoir.One more thing about the watering system is that it may take a while to \"calibrate\" the system. If you notice that the water level in the reservoir does not go down, the system is not properly calibrated. Simply refill the ceramic sensor. Repeat the process if necessary.
B000PGOON8 I was excited for the Plant Sitter to work, but alas, it must have gotten distracted and focused on playing on its cell phone when it should have been tending to the plant. Alas, so hard to find good sitters these days. :)Really, though, it's a good idea, but just didn't work for us. Maybe it was operator error, but the thing really didn't come with a lot of instructions.We placed in to tend a tomato plant that we had in a pot about 14\" in diameter.As we checked on it, it seemed that the water level in the Plant Sitter container was going down, so it seems like it was watering, but it just wasn't watering enough, and the tomato plant really struggled.This may be the type of Sitter that needs a watchful eye, but then, what's the point?It could be used as a backup for watering if you're prone to forget to water everyone once and a while, but as a main source for watering on a long vacation, I'd think twice about, unless you test it really well before you leave and are confident that it provides enough water for the size of planter you have.
B000PGOON8 When I was first offered this product for review, I thought \"What a great concept!\" Since I live in a condo and do container gardening outside, I decided to give this product the ultimate test by using it on the container for one of my tomato plants. It stayed there all summer and into the early fall.First off, you're supposed to soak the ceramic piece that's going to go into the soil in water. I totally didn't see that part of the instructions at the time, so that clearly could have impacted the plant sitter's performance that first week or so.  You then put the ceramic piece into the soil and put the long thin tube that is connected to it down into the plant sitter water well that hangs on the side of your plant's pot. Super simple and quick to install.The first problem I encountered is that the LID of the water well would not stay shut. This may not have been a problem if I'd been using it for an INDOOR plant, but it certainly was a problem with an outdoor plant, because all the bugs, dirt and other detritus that swirls around the parking lot of my condo could go right into the water. Over time, even if I occasionally poured out the old water and put new in, a green gunk grew on the inside bottom of the water well. I can't say exactly how much this impacted the plant sitter's ability to keep my plant watered, but I suspect it clogged up the tube somewhat.The end result was that, when comparing my two tomato plants in exactly the same containers with exactly the same type and amount of soil, the plant with the plant sitter generally needed less watering. HOWEVER, in no way would I have been able to rely on the plant sitter SOLELY to water my tomato plant, so I still watered with the hose when necessary (especially during that part of our summer that was over 100 degrees). I could see a small to medium house plant that didn't have a great need for water being able to survive over the long haul with this plant watering system, but not a large plant and not likely one (like my Spathiphillum) that constantly droops unless it is well and regularly watered.I would definitely get another plant sitter for an indoor house plant IF the company could fix the lid problem. The fact that the lid refused to latch and stay shut was a constant annoyance to me this summer...and trust me, I tried many times to get it to latch. I think I succeeded ONE TIME out of an entire summer of tending to my tomato plants...but it didn't stay closed for long.In summary, this plant sitter is a GREAT concept for those who want to have plants but travel often and don't want to pay someone to water their plants while they're gone. It is easy to set up and easy to use. If it hadn't been for the lid issue, I would have happily given this product 4 stars.
B000PGOON8 Although not a bad concept, and upon seeing it you think, \"Why not?  I'll give it a try,\" this item works better in theory than in practice.You can't really rely on it to keep your plants alive.  I think another review said you had to siphon the thing first.  That kind of takes away the \"automatic\" idea.  Maybe my expectations of the product were a little too high, and my review sounds a bit harsh, but when I see automatic, I want something truly automatic.Not only that, the system is a real eye-sore.Maybe plant sitting technology is still in its infancy and hopefully it will improve in the future.  I'm glad to see other users were able to get something out of the product.  I wish CobraCo the best of luck and hope they can some day live up to my higher expectations.
B000PGOON8 This does work.  It enables you to give your plants access to water when you are not around to water them.  But it's not exactly a needed product, even for dedicated plant lovers, since it none too hard to set up your own wicking system.  That would do the same job, and do it for a lot less money.So: it works.  No problem.  But...needed?  I don't know.
B000PGOON8 The COBRA 6000 PLANT SITTER works OK for what it is, however, the company didnt print the correct instructions for its use. You will NOT get any water moving into the watering stake, unless you syphon the water thru that hose. The instructions only mention filling up the stake with water. So, first fill up the water tank. DO NOT ADD ANY FERTILIZER. (You dont want to get that in your mouth.) Next, twist off the cap over the watering stake, and fill it up with water, RIGHT TO THE BRIM. Then, CAREFULLY put the cap back on. Now, SYPHON the water thru the hose, and when its flowing, then attach the hose to the plant stake. Place the plant stake as close to the roots as you can get it, without damaging them. Lastly, either hang the tank on the side of the planter, or place it ABOVE the plant's soil level, so you get good water flow. The hose's opening should ALWAYS be at the BOTTOM of the tank. The instructions remind you NEVER to let the tank run out of water, or let the water lever fall too low inside the watering stake. If you do, the syphoning suction will break down, and you'll have to initiate the syphoning process again.DOES THE COBRA 6000 WORK? Its OK, tho other self watering systems I've seen, use TWO of these watering stakes per planter. Unless you have a SMALL plant, just one stake wont moisten all the dirt in your planter, to the detriment of some of your roots. Also, the water tank is designed to attach to the side of a planter. However, its TOO BIG for that to work, unless you have at least a one gallon sized planter. It claims to water a plant UP TO 3 WEEKS. I guess they mean a cactus. I found the water tank to run out, after about 7-10 days.BEST METHOD FOR KEEPING YOUR PLANTS WATERED DURING VACATION.1. WATER THE PLANTS THOROUGHLY before you leave.2. COVER THE DIRT WITH WET PAPER TOWELS, or wet rags. Then, cover over the planter with a plastic bag. This will hold a LOT of water inside your planter. For outdoor plants, skip the plastic bag, cos you'll want to get whatever rain you can inside the planter.3. PLACE HUMIDITY TRAYS NEAR THE PLANTERS. Lack of humidity will cause extra evaperation thru the leaves.4. DONT PLACE IN DIRECT SUN. You'll want to get your plant to go almost into hibernation, while you're away.5. USE A WATERING SYSTEM LIKE COBRA 6000. I've seen people take a 1 liter plastic bottle, fill it with water, plug it with a rag, and place it upside down inside the planter. The water will slowly drain thru the dirt. This is good for BIG pots, and plants that like wet feet, like tropicals. The COBRA 6000 is a sophisticated version of that same method of watering, that works well for small planters.Overall, the COBRA 6000 works, but only on a smaller plant. If the plant is too big, the stake cant get water thru the WHOLE root system. Rememeber, to syphon the hose before use, make sure the opening is placed on the bottom of the tank. Also, keep the stake filled with water too. Best results were optained from placing the tank ABOVE the planter's rim, not hooked on the planter's side. If you place the water tank upon the rim, as the drawing on the cardboard container suggests, the weight of the filled tank might tip over the planter. Also, its less likely to work well, as the tank drains.Overall, a cheaper alternative to the more expensive, multi-pot watering systems. However, the vague, incomplete instructions, and the watering tank that's designed too large to hang on the planter's rim, might spoil this product for some.
B000PSFLT2 While I tried to swear off any more awful Chinese plastic hose accessories, favoring far better US brass stuff when available (not often), this was the only configuration that would work for my irrigation system without redoing the whole thing. Cheap and with a lot of optional ways to hook up stuff, and the shut-off valves are very handy.Although plastic threads usually fail after awhile, this device seems well-made with decently formed threads, a brace kit useful for some installations, an upper brass coupling and the valves work smoothly and are big enough to operate fairly easily.I had to take off a star because a somewhat similar, and discontinued, Orbit manifold sprung a leak right in the middle of the body and sometimes guilt by association is hard to deny.
B000PSFLT2 Plastic Manifold has Brass Coupler, 2 plastic End Caps, and 3 plastic Ball Valves for a total of 1 entry and 5 exits to the manifold.Ball Valves work smoothly and shut off completely.Manifold comes with a steel brace, mounting screws,  and instructions.To avoid the extra work of drilling holes in the block wall, I didn't use the enclosed steel brace. Instead, I measured the installed length of the Manifold to the ground at the intersection of the wall -- cut a length of White Schedule 40 PVC to fit, and have an easily-removable brace that's a plenty strong.I mounted a RainBird Pressure Gauge on the center valve -- an Orbit Digital Timer on the right that feeds a RainBird Gear-Drive Sprinkler -- and a 37' hose with a Bel-Aire Nozzle on the 3rd port for durability and versatility.All this behind a Valterra A01-1122VP High Flow, 55-lb Lead-Free Pressure Regulator -- ALL available here at Amazon.My order arrived promptly and in perfect condition. Thanks, Amazon !!
B000PSFLT2 I bought this to hook up a hose and two sprinklers at the same time, so I don't have to constantly switch hoses depending on which item needs use currently. Works great, made it through the first year. Each hose outlet has a on/off control valve which it's good. You probably won't be able to run 3 items at one time unless you have great water pressure in your home - or if they run just fine at low pressure. I definitely recommend bringing it in over the winter so it doesn't crack and leak. I've had two Gilmour two-way splitters before and they only lasted one year before they started leaking, however I didn't bring them in for the winter - so that may be the cause.
B000PSFLT2 I have this set up with two soaker hoses at either end.  Since they are so light, there is no need for me to use the anchor that came with the product.  For my needs, this product is just right!
B000PSFLT2 I have two of these, they are both working very well. I am very pleased with them and will buy more if the need arises.
B000PSFLT2 This is great to use in the garden I currently have two hoses attached to it and this helps me to get all over my property, we have 4 acres. I se it daily and have not had any problems.
B000PSFLT2 This was easy to hook up and is a life-saver now that I am trying my hand at landscaping and have several hoses going all over the yard. My only complaint is that it sometimes leaks, but I'm not sure if that's an error on my part or if it's the product itself. I also think that the hoses sometimes get stretched (as in, pulled slightly away from this product when they're in use), so the seal isn't as tight as it should be. It's easily fixed.Also, sometimes, for the same reason as above--stretching of hoses as they're used--the gold part on the top (that attaches to the main faucet) unscrews a bit and starts leaking. But you just have to twist it back on tight and again, probably only happens because the hose is being stretched.
B000PSFLT2 Kind of a cute little gadget and does serve a purpose. The supporting arm provided was useless so have to invent one of my own.. It sure makes it convenient to have several hoses at the ready and don't have to mess around disconnecting  and re connecting to change hoses
B000PSFLT2 The Orbit 3-way faucet valve is absolutely great so far. One or two reviewers almost scared me off by saying you should get the metal one instead, but I had a metal 2-way faucet valve and hated it. It leaked, it was too hard to turn the dials and it was surprisingly insubstantial for metal.This faucet valve comes with a brace you can attach to the back to bear some of the weight of the hoses, but I didn't attach it and I don't think I need to. Everything is tight and sturdy as can be. Maybe the angle of my faucet coming out of the wall makes it unnecessary to have a brace. After my experience with my last 2-way faucet valve I bought some washers for this one, but I haven't needed them at all. Not a drop of escaped water. I run a hose to one garden, a hose to a second garden in the opposite direction, and a hose across the yard to a dog pen. I had forgotten that sometimes I need water at the faucet for other things as well and was thinking about getting a 4-way faucet, when I realized the end cap screws off and there is your 4th outlet, and even a fifth one on the other side.I love this thing. It has solved so many problems for me. And again, it's sturdy! Nothing moves when I yank on one of the hoses. What a difference from my \"better\" metal one!Update -One month of constant use later: This connector has had a workout. Everything still works smoothly. I guess that is what impresses me most after having struggled with a brass connector. The individual dials turn sooo easily and when they are off, there is no leakage. This whole thing is so well made.Another update -One year later I am having to buy another one. I think the couple of deep freezes we had this winter did it in. But the price makes it painless to replace.
B000Q5S7RM I had an issue with my order that the seller resolved immediately, so I won't detail that.Once my worms arrived I opened them up and gave them some water before placing into the soil.  The box was a lot smaller than I anticipated; I was envisioning 4-6 inch long fat worms in a box the size of a gallon jug or bigger.  The box was about 8\" square, and the worms were TINY- average was an inch, inch and a half long.  But I've no doubt there was 1000 in there.  Once it warms up in SoCal I'll be buying several more boxes for my garden.
B000Q5S7RM It's not every day that a bag full of lively worms land on your doorstep. Several generations of these worms have feasted on our compost pile ever since, leaving everyone happy.
B000Q5S7RM Arrived on time and included a bunch of live red wigglers.  I didn't see any dead worms and my worms have been thriving in my composter.  They also started mating right away... I don't know if that's a sign of adjustment or not but they do seem to be very happy worms.  I would definitely buy from this company again.
B000Q5S7RM Healthy, live, wiggly worms. Put them in my compost bin and hopefully they will do the job. If they migrate out to the rest of the yard thats fine. I will be back for more.
B000Q5S7RM Ordered in March going to Fl. And they arrived quickly and all alive. The worms are happy and thriving in my compost bed. They are already improving the crappy dense non draining pile of fill that I have been putting my household compost in. I noticed the hump in the middle is going down faster and it's getting more like soil rather then muck fill. Still has a long way to go before I can plant but the worms are definitely improving the quality and airation. Gotta have worms and this company was a good choice to get them from!
B000Q5S7RM I bought these because I am having a problem in part of my lawn with compaction.  I have some heavy clay under my soil.  I have aerated my lawn, but it just need some more help.They arrived packed well, and had a cooling pack to keep them from getting too hot.  They also included a sheet of instructions which I highly recommend you read before putting them out.  I did not find any dead worms.  In the instructions and FAQ with this company they stated that the worms may seem a little thin from being dehydrated from shipping, but mine were fat and healthy.I followed the instructions and put them out in one spot and covered them with damp newsprint, after loosening up the soil (I used a pitch fork).  They started wriggling down into the soil right away.  I checked the next day under the newsprint and did not see a one, so I am sure they are happy underground,  and I am looking forward to them helping my lawn.
B000Q5S7RM I'm trying to think of something to say about a bag of worms.  They're worms, right?First of all, there were several dead ones.  Of course I didn't count them, but there were enough to notice the difference between the moving worms and the motionless/limp/lifeless ones.  I guess some perishing in transit might be normal, I don't know.Second, there were some critters other than worms.  Some of them look like miniature centipedes, others are just little wiggly things.  I guess it's inevitable that you'll have supplemental detritus-eaters, but actually I was expecting only worms.Hopefully these are the last worms I'll ever buy.
B000QD7MZ2 This is supposed to be a hummingbird feeder, not a nectar fountain....... It IS big, and once assembled, it looks attractive. It was fairly easy to assemble except for the little yellow centers, which kept popping out and flying onto the floor, but once that was taken care of the unit was impressive, looked very nice.Adding the cylinder, which I had thankfully  filled only 1/3 with sugar syrup, was an unwieldy process, But  I did that over the kitchen sink and once I mastered that and everything was in place, and the feeder was ready to hang on my balcony -- that was when I noticed the syrup dripping out from UNDER the red flowers. Had it been dripping out from under ONE of the flowers I might have been more forgiving but ALL the flowers were leaking. Nuh Uh --  I just installed a new balcony rug and there is NO way I am going to hang that on my balcony.Like some of the other reviewers did, I will disassemble it, and GLUE the flowers on to see if THAT helps. If that doesn't work then this product is  waste of everyone's time.
B000QD7MZ2 PROS- large size, individual perches, easy to hang bailCONS- all plastic, including the nectar bottleThe main advantage of this model is its large size, so if you have lots of hummer activity, you won't run out as fast.  Also, being plastic, it doesn't weigh as much as those with glass bottles, though of course once you fill it with a larger amount of nectar it weighs more.However, I do wonder if some of the plastic from the bottle is getting into the nectar.  We try to avoid plastic packaging in our house, what is this plastic doing to the hummers.  Also, I wonder if the clear plastic bottle will discolor or scuff from cleaning over time, in a way that glass wouldn't.The bail (hanging loop) is larger and easier to manipulate than on other hummingbird feeders I have, but it still gets in the way of standing the bottle up straight when filling it.  If they had made it just a bit larger, or designed the plastic bottle to have some recesses in it for the bail, then the bottle could stand up straight when needed.
B000QD7MZ2 I'm not sure that the hummingbirds around here will be enough to drink up all the nectar before it spoils.  It holds 48 ounces, which of course is a quart and a half.  So be aware of that if you don't get lots of hummers around your area.The base is a little hard to clean, as it doesn't come fully apart.  I usually run it through the dishwasher on the top rack with the heat OFF.  So far, so good.  I wish it had an ant moat like my other feeder, with that one I can fill the top little moat with water and keep the ants from getting to the nectar.The nectar chamber is made of plastic, so it's not as heavy as if it was made of glass and less likely to break.  The base simply twists into place.  It has a large metal bail which is easy to get on and off my hanging hooks.  It has 6 feeding stations with perches, so multiple birds COULD feed at once, but we have a male here who runs off everyone else if he's anywhere around the feeder!If you're looking for a decent, sturdy feeder that holds a LOT of nectar, then this is the one for you.  The box also states it is made in the USA, which was a BIG plus for me.
B000QD7MZ2 I have yet to find the perfect hummingbird feeder, and I've gone through a lot.  This feeder is no exception.While it holds a lot of nectar and has six ports, I find that hummingbirds are too territorial to allow more than one family to feed -- one male, one female, and, eventually, a couple of juveniles.  The huge capacity of nectar is wasted since it must be changed twice a week to avoid bacteria and mold.At first, I absolutely loved that it didn't leak while hanging in its place -- and then I had to change the nectar.  The moment I moved the feeder, nectar poured out of the spouts and over my hands.  It was even messier when I turned it upside down to unlock the base.  I was covered with sugar water. I'm sure the ants had a field day below.The feeder comes unassembled, with no instructions.  It was pretty easy to figure out, although if the flowers aren't all the way in, the feeder will leak right away.  Everything is plastic.  This feeder is much easier to clean than others.I just wish someone would make a bee-proof, non-leaking, easy-to-clean, easy-to-fill feeder.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann
B000QD7MZ2 I do love the size and the 6 ports to feed from but I can already see it is hard to open and fill and get closed right again so it doesn't leak. I don't really expect this to last more than this season. Don't get this size unless you have a lot of hummers coming because you should refill your feeder and clean it once a week so if you fill it full and don't have enough hummers to use it up there will be a lot of waste. If you don't need that much just fill it half full. You can always add more if needed but be sure to clean your feeder every time you put more syrup in it for them to drink.You really need to push firmly on each piece as you put the feeder flowers on and the center parts. If they aren't on right they will just fall off so you'll know if you did it right or not. The stand for the hummer feet are on securely because they have little cut outs for them to fit tightly before screwing them tight onto the feeder. Just take your time putting these features on so you don't break them.UPDATE: The little yellow centers in each flower that are snapped in independently are coming off. The Orioles keep playing with them and they are coming off even though I had them on securely. Now there is an opening large enough for any bird, fly, wasp, etc. to get into the juice. Not a good thing. When this is empty I won't use it again. Spend more and get a nice glass feeder, they are the best.
B000QD7MZ2 Early May is the start of humming bird season around our house so the arrival of the Perky-Pet feeder was very timely. Like clockwork, the little critters came looking for food and my wife was able to put the feeder in the garden in time to satisfy a small flock of these fascinating creatures.The feeder holds a lot nectar and that's both a blessing and a curse. The blessing, when there are a lot of birds feeding, you don't have to refill as often. The curse, the base doesn't come apart and because of its internal corners and seams, it's hard to clean.The tube is easy to clean but the base is somewhat inaccessible making it hard to get spotless - important because around here, mold forms quickly.The small perches are used by the birds, giving us a good long look as they feed.Overall, a good product and recommended if you are a careful and dedicated cleaner. Else, keep shopping.
B000QD7MZ2 This has been a great year for the hummers in our yard.  Have two nests, each with two eggs and a source of pleasure just watching.  The one feeder that we have had just doesn't hold enough and a royal pain to clean.  So glad we were able to get this---it holds plenty of our \"nectar\" and refills a lot less often, very easy to clean.  The really great feature is that this holds 48oz of nectar.....enough to last more than a day!  After years of feeders in our yard I can honestly say this is the cream of the crop----I'm thinking the hummers agree!  A great product for so much entertainment in our outdoor space.**May 17, 2014  This update is an unhappy one! Our huge feeder now has a leak underneath, along the bottom of the base...what a mess!  We had it hanging in a tree and thought that the wind was causing the feeder to sway too much, losing all of the solution.  We decided to place it on a stable post to correct the problem...wrong!  The plastic base piece is open for easy cleaning, but actually consists of two attached pieces that do not make a good seal .  We are totally disappointed with Perky-Pet concerning this flaw in design.  Hopefully, the company will soon address this issue, and figure out a way to make a bottom piece that is solid. but easy to clean.  This also applies to the models that have two separate bottom pieces that Really Leak!  We like Perky-Pet products, and hope that the solution to the leaking problems will be soon!
B000QD7MZ2 Who can resist the tiny delicate hummingbird?  I love seeing them in gardens at flowers such as coral bells, honeysuckle, columbine, delphinium, trumpet vine and other plants that tend to have a bell like blossom.  This feeder when filled with a syrupy liquid will attract the lovely creatures too but it is a bit of a pain to put together and if the user is not very careful spills and leaks are a fact of life.  Holding forty-eight ounces this is the &#34;grand master&#34; of hummingbird feeders but I still prefer the old fashioned method of feeding them with flowers thus receiving the additional benefit of more beauty and color in my yard.
B000QD7MZ2 While it's attractive, it's way too large. I prefer having (several) smaller feeders. Party because hummers are territorial they like having &#34;their own&#34; feeder to go to. And a feeder with 48 oz. of nectar is going to take a long time for the birds to empty. Probably one will never fill it  more than 1/4 full. Nectar liquid goes bad in a few days, especially in hot temperatures.  All the red color on the unit itself is bound to attract, but I prefer glass feeders these days, they hold up better in the hot sun and with time.
B000QD7MZ2 This hummingbird feeder does its job. It's much larger than many others on the market- 48 oz. Its constructed of plastic, but seems relatively sturdy. Other people have had problems with leaks, but I haven't experienced any after 2 months of use; (if any do develop I'll update the review). One thing to keep in mind for first time hummingbird feeder buyers is that you have to buy special food so that the hummingbirds don't starve to death on sugar water. They need nutrients, and it's only fair for you to know that ordering this feeder won't be everything you need to get up and running.It's easy enough to clean, although for people like me who don't like to take the time to disassemble, clean and dry multiple parts it's not fun. I'm not aware of any alternatives, just something to keep in mind because I'll either make the effort to pull apart and hand wash my juicer or the birds', but not both. Only one of us will get our nectar!
B000QD7MZ2 There are many different styles and sizes of hummingbird feeders. The hummingbirds don't seem to care as long as there's fresh nectar (sugar water).This 48 ounce feeder is BIG. Unless the hummingbirds we get would consume 48 ounces within a couple of days, this size is overkill. That's because when the daily temperature hits the 90's, a couple of days is the most we can go before replacing the nectar and cleaning the feeders.I don't know about the store bought nectar because we make our own (3 parts boiling water to 1 part sugar), but it can go cloudy in as quick as a day during the hottest part of summer. Cloudy is bad, as are visible black floating specks. It means contamination.As long as the nectar doesn't get contaminated, cleaning is pretty easy, it's really just a matter of rinsing. However, once there's contamination, a full out washing is the only way to feel it's safe to use again.For me, the best feeders are the ones that are the easiest to use and the easiest to clean. This one fits the bill; it is easy to take apart, fill and clean.On the negative side, I had a knee jerk reaction to the plastic bottle. Only time will tell, but I have had plastic feeder bottles that became brittle and / or cracked in as little as one summer's use. (Probably due to our mountain location where summer temps can hit 90 during the day and drop to the 45 at night.)For my purposes, this feeder is okay. Of all the feeders that we have tried, I like Perky Pet's, but prefer their smaller ones. I start with putting a couple out in April and add as the hummer population grows. By July, when the Rufus' come in, we have a dozen in different places about the deck. These are my favorite:Perky-Pet 8109-2 Antique Glass Bottle Hummingbird Feeder-16-Ounce Capacity, Redand thePerky-Pet 447-12 Round 10-Ounce Glass Hummingbird Feeder.
B000QD7MZ2 While this is one of the larger hummiingbird feeders, it lacks in quality. First, it's all plastic, unlike their other product, the 209B. It also came with the drinknig stations unassembled (though the other model comes assembled). There were also twice as many pieces sent - is this a mistake or intentionally wasteful? So while this feeder is functional, it just isn't nice as a glass one.Please toss away the included food. It contains dyes that can be toxic to birds. It's unconscionable  that Perky-pet is including this nasty stuff with their feeders. Just mix 4 parts water to 1 part sugar and you'll be good to go.
B000QD7MZ2 This is not your typical Perky-Pet hummingbird feeder simply because our hummers avoid it often.  Even after setting out fresh food along with the other Perky-Pet models, they only visit this feeder when the other 4 are busy with birds.It should be the center feeder with all of its features attractive to birds and old geezers.  The birds voted with their feeding habits and have said they are not too interested.  The humans like a large, 48 ounces in this case, feeder; however, unless a large eating population has arrived the 220 (this one) goes stale.  We probably refill more often than necessary, but, I'd rather do that, especially in the beginning of the season, to encourage their eating at our stations.  The 220 has 6 'seats' for the birds and when you watch them, they will sit there, socialize and eat for a short time and then begin a fight with the arrival of the Alpha Hummer.The top has a built in moat and that is a nice feature since it does keep out the ants but not the wasps.  There is nothing that I know of that will eliminate wasps, but do we want to?  The hummers do not seem to care.  They just go to another feeder.  I do not care for the plastic feeding tube.  On the first two refills, it leaked and it was my fault for not tightening the bottom to the tube tightly.  Because it is a light plastic tube, the wind blows it easily and in doing so the food comes out of the holes.If the birds begin enjoying this feeder similar to the other ones, I will edit this and make necessary changes.  Of course, there may be reasons to downgrade it also.
B000QD7MZ2 This just came today in time for hummer season this year. Anxious to see how well it holds the large about of feed that it is rated for. The lid seems a little wonky to screw on, so we shall see. I expect this to last about one season with the critter activity we have here. Went together fairly easily and should provide a lot of feeding stations for the birds.
B000QD7MZ2 This feeder is great.  It is easy to clean.  No more sticking something down inside it try to clean stuff out.  The base does not come apart but there is plenty of room for a dish brush or cloth to get in there and clean.  I was slightly disappointed that the nectar holding part is plastic.  For some reason I thought it would be glass.  We will see how it holds up in the weather but so far so good.
B000QD7MZ2 Perky-Pet 220 The Grand Master 48-Ounce Hummingbird FeederCategory: Accessories...One can never have too many Hummingbird feeders! :)Notes after using the Perky-Pet 220 The Grand Master 48-Ounce Hummingbird Feeder for a couple of weeks:  In the box, one finds 1 Perky-Pet 220 The Grand Master 48-Ounce Hummingbird Feeder, 6 red flower-shaped medallions, 6 yellow (coin sized) inserts with feeding holes for flower-shaped medallions, 6 perches and 3 metal screws -- all in individual (clear) packets.Note, the feeder is not fully assembled (and Mine didn't come with instructions). so, just grab a pair of gardening gloves and press one of the (included) red plastic flower-shaped medallions into each of the 6 holes on the base of the unit -- *snap* -- . Next, press one of the (included) yellow coin-like inserts into each of the red flower-shaped medallions.  The (included) perches will need to be screwed into the underside of the base with a flathead screwdriver (not included). One will find 3 pre-drilled holes, one for each of the perches. When finished, there will be a perch above each of the flower-shaped medallions for the little Hummers to rest on while sipping nectar. Done!The unit is made of a very sturdy, thick, plastic. Cleaning the Perky-Pet 220 The Grand Master 48-Ounce Hummingbird Feeder, for the first time, was quick and easy. A normal sized bottle brush did the job.The nectar reservoir is crystal clear, making it easy to see the nectar level from a distance. The opening is large, making for easy filling or cleaning.  The large base, with six feeding ports, easily screws on, or off, the feeding reservoir for refills or cleaning. One fills the reservoir when the unit is upside down, screws on the base and flips unit right side up, then hangs in designated place via a sturdy metal hanger built into the cap. The red cap -- at the top of the unit -- also screws off, providing a flat surface for filling the unit. Nice!Perky-Pet 220 The Grand Master Hummingbird Feeder has a 48 ounce nectar capacity --  that's 6 whole (8 ounce) cups of nectar. This will make the feeder a bit heavy, so one will need to select a sturdy hook, or tree branch, to hang it from. The large size, and weight (when filled with nectar), of the Hummingbird feeder, keeps the wind from blowing it back and forth. It is also large enough to be seen from a distance, making it a very nice focal point in the garden or on the patio. There is no ant trap/moat on this Feeder....Neighbor-envy... The Hummers flock to my new Perky-Pet 220 The Grand Master 48-Ounce Hummingbird Feeder ..  *smiles, sips espresso*tip:  this is the nectar recipe I've used for years:  add 1/4 cup of pure cane sugar to 1 cup boiling water -- stir till clear -- let cool -- add to Hummingbird feeder. Change out once a week...Does the Perky-Pet 220 The Grand Master 48-Ounce Hummingbird Feeder, sound like what you may be looking for? :)  Highly Recommended!  --Katharena Eiermann, 2014
B000QD7MZ2 As a brand I like Perky-Pet Hummingbird feeders the best this one I have some doubts. It comes in a box and you need to assemble it no instructions included but it is obvious how to do it. My fear was you have to press so hard on the plastic red flowers to snap into the base it would crack, same with the yellow rings. It did go together without cracking. The top that holds the bottle seems to come off too easy I fear if the feeder if full it may fall to the ground. The one thing that really disappointed me is the built in metal hanger is just a tad to long to slide over the shepherds hook without spilling some of the sugar water out onto the ground.Last Summer I read that the red dye is hard on the kidneys of the hummingbirds so I make my own sugar water and they drink it down faster than I can make it. I hope this year adding 2 large feeders it can be a once a week fill and clean. It is early here yet the scout hummers are out as one came to my window 3 times last week where last year I had a window feeder that broke. I do have this one out now but I didn't fill it I do want to make sure my regulars know they can count on food again this year.If the unit does fail I will come back and update my review.
B000QD7MZ2 We have another Hummingbird feeder with small perches, and we've found that Hummingbirdsdo use the perches, and in doing so allows us to watch them longer.This large and roomy Hummingbird feeder is 25\" around the base (7 3/4\" dia) which allows ample roomfor the birds to share six feeding ports, which is nice since Humming birds are rather territorial.It's well made, and the plastic of the six perches are flexible, durable, and are a nice large size (1 1/2\" wide)The feeder doesn't come with instructions how to put it together, however, it's obvious how it belongs.Except for the yellow buttons which took a second glance to understand they snap in rounded side up.The 6 buttons and 6 flowers are quite firm to snap together, but the flowers easily pull out to clean.And the yellow centers punch out easily with a slotted screwdriver.A very nice 48 oz feede
B000QD7MZ2 The hummingbirds and orioles love this feeder.  There is a place for their cute, little feet.  So do I love it.  It is easy to take apart and clean.  I use little brushes.  It holds a lot of liquid so I do not have to fill constantly.  I have a number of feeders going at the same time and have at least 50 hummingbirds humming around all day long in the summer.  I hang these feeders in the shade of a tree.  Would definitely recommend.
B000QD7MZ2 I have three different feeders in my backyard and this seems to be the favorite. Sadly, my hummingbirds fight so, at most, I'll get two hummingbirds carefully spaced. Even so, they don't want to go to one of the other feeders but rather fight over this one.They don't share very well, so it's really kind of big since I change the solution regularly.The one thing that really brings this down to three stars for me is that the diameter of the lip of the top that fits into the base is too big. First, the top needs to be inserted, it goes down about a half-inch, and then it is turned and locked into place. I was having a very difficult (and messy) time getting the top to fit. I finally had to shave off some of the rim around the base with a razor. Happy to say that I still have ten fingers.It is easy to clean and I don't have a problem with the vacuum effect that I've had with other feeders.So, it's a five for the hummingbirds and a three for me -- average is four.06/22/2014: I changed my review to a three today. Even though I've tried to shave away some of the plastic on the base, it's still a tight squeeze. Today while trying to maneuver the container onto the base, the whole thing slipped, spewing sugar water all over my kitchen. Now I should also add, \"the ants give it a five.\"
B0016KV73W Used it numerous times in less than 60 days! My daughter was potty trained the first weekend of November 2013. I took this with us on a trip into my office for a backup plan. She has great bladder control (can last upwards of three hours). We left the office after three hours and put her in the back of my SUV with the potty and me (not a ton of extra room but we managed....wanted to give her some privacy from prying eyes :)) she never saw this thing before. She sat right on it and did her business (#1). This portable solution fits in a large tote or purse. I have used it to attach to a regular toilet on the go (just used it tonight at a friend's house at a child's bday party). Very easy.The liners are good. No leaks. I purchased extra liners too. I haven't tried rigging a regular plastic bag with paper towels yet. Afraid of leaks.With newly potty trained tots, I think you need a convenient solution for an immediate need. Buy it!
B0016KV73W I'll cut to the chase.PROS:Here's the brilliance of this potty seat:1) the \"wings\" (which serve as the base for the seat when in stand-alone potty form) that flip out to put on the adult toilet seat are secure and heavyweight;2) these same wings have rubberized grippy bits on the ends, which keeps them from slipping around on the adult potty seat;3) the base of the flipped-out bits can serve as a grip for the child inclined to grab the (*ack*) public seat.We've used this primarily as a portable potty seat, because we have another portable potty chair in the back of our van.  It fits neatly into its plastic bag, and the plastic bag fits very easily with room to spare into our backpack (which we use instead of a diaper bag). But I can see this working well for that function, too.CON:1) the hole is small, which makes wiping a newbie a little challenging.  (It doesn't bother me, because my child stands to get wiped at this stage.) I suspect some ankle-grabbing would suffice.  It doesn't pose a problem for the function, just, potentially, the cleanup.Overall: win!
B0016KV73W I love this potty! Much easier to use this then hold my 14 month old son over a regular toilet every morning to do his business! We part time EC, and this has been working perfectly, wish I had bought it sooner! He loves it set up on the floor, & has become much more interested in going #1 in the potty as well!To those complaining that it collapses on their little ones, you don't have it set up correctly. You need to push the legs into the potty base till you here each side click. I highly suggest watching YouTube videos on potette plus set up.I purchased the silicone reusable insert for the potty so we don't have to mess with bags... Much greener and cheaper! I bought the potty & liner for $15 bucks, you really can't beat that!
B0016KV73W This is so perfect. We go to the beaches all the time and there are no bathrooms and a child learning to potty can't hold it til we find a toilet somewhere. This works perfect. Small, easy, secure. I love that it also comforts to a toilet seat to put on an adult toilet seat in a public restroom. I use it most though for our beach trips. The liner you can buy for it works great but when I run out and haven't ordered none regular grocery bags work just as well.***edit. Oct. 5th, 2012 I had to order another one since we lost or had our stolen when we were getting some maintenance done on our car and it was in our car :( but soon as i realized it was missing I was online ordering another one because this is the best invention in the world especially for long trips, beach trips, or out anywhere that just doesn't have potties, especially for a little one that can't hold it like adult can, when my 2 year old says I have to potty she has to go and go NOW so its great to have in the car when there just isn't a store or gas station around for her to go potty at. I ordered 3 packs of refills with my original purchase and still have 2 full packs left LOVE LOVE THIS product and so does my daughter she has no problem going on it***
B0016KV73W Pros-Travels easy (it fits in my diaper bag) & it has a travel bagSecures great on the pottyYou can do it as a free standing for out & about emergencies ( they have an insert you can buy)It gives my toddler confidence that he's not going to fall inConsIf you use it as a stand alone the legs have to be locked in & it was a little hard for me to snap into placeI've bought 2 - one for home & one for travel. He loves it, this was the only thing that was worth a darn besides the primo potty
B0016KV73W This seat is such a convenient thing to have! It is small enough to put in a backpack or diaper bag and it comes with a storage bag. It makes sitting on public toilets easier (for kids and parent) and could be its own potty in an emergency. The only reason that I deducted a star is one design \"flaw\" that I'm not sure if they could do anything about. The front bottom is shaped/sized so that if my son's aim isn't down enough, it will actually cause the stream to start splattering. He's usually good about it and it isn't the end of the world to clean up a little, but I think it could be better in that respect. Would definitely recommend.
B0016KV73W This is extremely handy for an outing, especially when potty training a 2 year old. It took me some time to figure out how to lock the legs in place, but it's not a big deal now. My only complaint would be that the legs are so short, so even my two year old's knees end up in his chest. But I guess that's what you get for portable.
B0016KV73W This potty was a total impulse buy for me, before we started potty training my son.  I thought it looked cool, and I was pregnant with my 2nd, so I bought it on a whim.  However, it was SO worth the money!  We are outside a LOT, especially at parks/playgrounds....and I'm not going to lie, I just can't handle the port-a-potty.  I can't do it!  So, this has really saved us from having to pack up and go home early.  We keep it in the back of our car, and just set it up whenever we need it.  We've never really used it as a seat cover, just as a travel potty.  I can fit it in my diaper bag, but it takes up a lot of room.  It would be nice if it were smaller, but for what it does, I highly recommend it!
B0016KV73W My almost 3 year old daughter falls through the opening when sitting on it. She also tells me &#34;it hurts my butt&#34;. It will be in our next yard sale needless to say. I was hoping this would work for her. I even tried putting her foam cushion from her home potty seat on the top and she still refuses to use it. The foam isn't a perfect fit and just makes it clumsy feeling to her. The opening is way too big for a typical child of 2 to 3 years of age in my opinion. My daughter is not petite either.
B0016KV73W My son is in the 97th percentile and about 2 1/2.  This thing was so tiny it was a joke.  I could see how it might be great if it was appropriately sized for your child, but it is definitely not the answer if you have a bigger than average kiddo.
B0016KV73W We initially got this for our petite 2 year old. He was already going potty in a little froggy potty (also bought on Amazon) and was doing so well but it became a problem when we would go out in public because he was terrified to use the large toilets. So we bought this and it solved the problem! So small and extremely easy clean up. He has even gone in the car with this little potty. Needless to say, he didn't end up using it a ton since he eventually got brave enough to use a normal toilet but we still keep it in our truck in it's nice little bag just in case or if we need to use while on the road. Great product!
B0016KV73W The potette is really portable and well-made, but I think I was happier with my ikea potty - it took up a little more space and didn't fold down or convert to a training seat (which is cool) but at least I didn't have to use plastic bags with it (I don't buy the potette liners - they seem pointless. I just use an old plastic bag and a rag or cloth diaper in the bottom, and then wait until I'm somewhere I can offload the poop without having to send another plastic bag to a landfill). I would love to figure out an \"on the go\" solution for the potette that didn't require a plastic bag at all. On the other hand - the potette is thoughtfully made and small enough to fit my one year old, who much prefers to use a potty than a diaper.
B0016KV73W I bought this potty to keep in the car for when we are out and about. In the &#34;potty&#34; position (legs down) it isn't sturdy at all because the legs don't lock in that position. Twice it has collapse under the my baby which has led to epic meltdowns. So in reality it's just a travel toilet reducer. Not very 2-in-1.
B0016KV73W This was the best buy I could have done for the summer vacation on the beach. We went to Europe on vacation and it is usual  there not to have restrooms available on the beach so I was worried about how to handle my 3 year old potty training phase. I bought this product and it has proven to be phantastic!!! Clean and easy to use and comfortable for the kid. Size is also quite reasonable as it fits perfectly in the beach bag. All my friends with kids same age wanted to get it too.
B0016KV73W I bought this because I needed a portable potty for my son. He is fully potty trained but doesnt tell us he needs to go until he is about to pee himself. I was really tired to hovering him over the toilet (thank goodness he is small for his age or else id drop him right in) especially with a bad back and weak arms. I was really looking into the foldup ones for convenience but saw that it was not sturdy and did not fit public toilets. I am so glad i found this. it folds up nicely and is sturdy. I am so happy i read reviews because i found on another review that to use it in a sitting position/potty you have to push it up to lock in place. Anyways the day i got this in the mail my sister took my kids and me to the park and as soon as we got there my son was doing the pee pee dance. I pulled this out, popped the legs in place, popped the baggy in it, put it behind the tree, shimmied down his chones and plopped him on there. He was a bit confused cuz the bag and all but he did his thing and it was all gravy. We also used it on our toilet at home. He loves it. And i love it. =)
B0016KV73W A great little travel potty for early trainers, but the instructions are not complete.Pros:Small size is perfect for babies and young toddlers.Can be used as either a stand-alone potty or on top of a toilet, giving you options.Folds up very compact.You can use standard plastic grocery bags, just put a paper towel or cloth diaper inside.Cons:The legs are wobbly in the stand-alone potty position, making me a little nervous if my baby was too wiggly. EDIT: I figured out why the legs felt wobbly. You need to push them UP towards the seat to fully lock them. The enclosed instructions do not say this, but it's very important!!!The bags that are designed for the potty stink of perfume.
B0016KV73W My 2 1/2 year old was ready for potty training and we love his potty seat at home (which also sits on the toilet but is for all day use), but we are on the go quite a bit so we bought this potty seat.  He loves to use it!  It's compact enough for a diaper bag (or backpack which we use) and it worked great at Disney World.  It's pretty darn sturdy too.  I've even set it up in his carseat for him to go in a compact car.  Yeah, it's not as sturdy as a free standing training potty, but it's not meant to be kept at home on the ground for use all day.  I love that it sits on top of a toilet as well, which made potty training during a hotel visit a piece of cake.  I do NOT recommend buying additional bags.  A plastic grocery bag with a paper towel works just as well.  Just be sure to check the bag for holes first and have them ready to go in the car.
B0016KV73W We were happy our toddler has been successful with potty training with her baby bjorn potty chair, so we decided to get this for on the go.  Unfortunately, she is so scared and doesn't want to sit on the Potette.  =(  We have tried countless times and she refuses to sit on it.Read some amazing reviews and hope we would have the same luck with the Potette.
B0016KV73W let me just say this potty seat is amazing! It's sturdy, little enough to put almost anywhere, folds down great. I bought some extra liners, but in my opinion save your money & buy the reusable liner that goes with this seat. Also wonderful quality, and come on, how hard is it to dump out & wipe with a wet wipe.
B0016KV73W This is the best baby product ever invented!  It's cheap, sturdy & fits in my kid's skip hop bag.  We have had potty training success because of this gem!  She's going on her 3rd week of PT & this weekend we took her to Disney on Ice & a weekend trip to the beach.  The crowds in public restrooms I think intimidate her but I just put this potty on the back seat of the car in the parking lot & wha la! When the crowds are smaller I use the handicap stall & set this potty up on the side & we take a potty break together.  On the beach I set up her potty in a play tent & she had her own little outhouse.  She loves her new potty & so do I!  We no longer have to fear accidents or her holding it too long till she feels comfortable.  The liners are super absorbant so you don't have a messy, leaking bag to deal with.  I won't leave home without it.  Thank you inventers of the potette travel potty.  THANK YOU!
B0016KV73W Seriously, whoever came up with this invention is even better than Henry Ford for inventing cars; hands-down this is the greatest purchase I have made for my 18mo daughter...and we've purchased a LOT!  My daughter said \"potty?\" the other day while in public, and was terrified of me holding her over the big (nasty) public restroom potty and wouldn't go...so in the diaper it was, poor thing. So we purchased this potty on the suggestion of a fellow Mom.I was skeptical, as my daughter is used to a padded seat, that sits on our big toilet (we've gone that route and not a mini-potty...she's done amazing starting at about 16mos~) so I was a bit concerned on whether or not she would understand what this was (when used as a stand-alone potty on the floor/ground):  it came in the mail, I opened it, popped out the legs and locked them in place (**you have to pull them out to standing position, then push them upwards into the seat until you hear them click**) and set it on the floor...she immediately exclaimed \"potty!!!\" and sat down to hang out.  SUCCESS!!  From here on out this new travel potty was my bff.I keep it in it's plastic bag, in our diaper bag 24/7...it paid for itself twice already: having it at my parent's house 3hrs away to pop the legs to the side and put on the big potty, when I didn't think to bring her usual potty seat, and again when we were on the beach and she said \"potty\".  I don't go anywhere without it, ever.It comes with plastic bags that will hook around it, that they pee/poo into when you'er on the go, and inside is a little \"pad\" to soak it all up...don't waste your money on more of these specialty bags...use some plastic grocery store bags, and line them with the thick maxi pads...it's the same exact thing, and a FRACTION of the cost since you can buy cheapo brand pads.BUY THIS ITEM!!!!
B0016KV73W This toilet helped make potty training so easy for us. We brought it to the park, the playground, shopping. I was a little shy using it indoors in public (although would in a pinch so long as I could find a somewhat quiet, uninhabited corner somewhere), but had NO shame whatsoever having my daughter cop a squat at the playground or wherever outdoors. And when we were running errands, I would open the back of my SUV, and have her sit there and go. I would just stand in front of her for safety and to give her a bit of privacy. Also, when I was pregnant, it helped me avoid public restrooms and having to hold my almost three year old over a toilet, big belly and all. I cannot recommend this enough.
B0016KV73W We carry this with us in the car whenever we go out.  It has a little plastic case that comes with it, but we use that to store the bags, and got a separate (washable) bag to carry the potty in.  It's fantastic.  Going out to eat and don't want to balance your toddler on the big toilet seats?  Bring this along, lay it flat and your toddler is comfortable and protected from germs!  On a road trip and don't want to risk a gas station restroom, or your toddler needs to go NOW and you're on a stretch of open road?  No problem!  You click the potette into the \"seat\" position (note that people complain about the seat collapsing, but it won't do that if you just click the \"legs\" into their place.  You MUST click/lock it in to the upright or flat position, otherwise it's not stable), put it in the back of your wagon,  or in the back seat on a relatively flat surface, or on the side of the road even, your toddler sits down and pees/poops, you tie up the bag and knot it (please don't litter - just store the bag in the back of your car, or the trunk until you can toss it in the garbage - if you knot the bag, you don't smell it), and boom, you are on your way!  My daughter loves it - she prefers going on the potty \"in the car\" rather than going into an unfamiliar restroom, and on more than one occasion, it's been a lifesaver pulling over by the side of the road for an emergency pit stop.It's all plastic and is easily wiped down by a disinfectant wipe, and takes up little room when stored flat.  You can buy refill liners for about 50 cents a bag (I got a 30 pack from Wal-Mart for 40 cents a bag), which some might say is costly, but we only use them when we go out, so 30 should last us a long time.  When we ran out of our initial supply that comes with the potty, I did use plastic grocery bags (make sure there are no holes in the bag!) and some left over absorbent pads from my pregnancy kit.  You can save money by going this route, but you either have to carry around a bag of women's panty liners/pads and grocery bags, or do it up in advance and then fold them all flat so they are ready to go.  That seems like a lot of work to me, so we just buy the pre-made ones from Kalencom.The only \"negative\" I can comment on about this potty is that it's not ideal as your primary potty seat for potty training.  I like that it's all plastic for easy clean-up on the go, but we did end up buying a cushioned potty seat for at-home potty training.  When your toddler is sitting for a long time on the potty, cushioning is nice, and our daughter found this seat too uncomfortable when sitting for long periods of time.  However, now that she is fully potty trained, she could use this seat for everyday use at home just fine.Overall, I highly recommend the Potette and it's definitely one of our best purchases for our toddler.
B0016KV73W Great on-the-go potty because the sides fold in and it's easy to stash in a bag. Love that it's both a stand-alone potty and a toilet topper.  if your toilet is oblong shaped like ours, this potty seat will seem too small.  We always have to remind our son to point it down and to close his legs before he starts to pee.  Otherwise, it will almost always splash out of the gap between the potty seat and the toilet seat or over the potty seat - something we do not have a problem with on our Baby Bjorn toilet trainer.
B0016KV73W This potty lives in my car trunk and its great for car trips and has been used more then I thought it would be.  Only minor issue is the seat sometimes wants to close while my kid is sitting on it but I just hold her and for a 30 second potty break it works perfectly.
B0016KV73W This little portable potty chair has been a life safer as we have traveled around with our almost 3 year old
B0016KV73W This travel potty is on my \"baby must-have\" list.  We've used it while traveling on both long trips and short and also while camping.  It's great to use as a booster potty on those icky campground port-a-potties.  We keep it in the car just in case!
B0016KV73W This is one of my top five favorite baby/toddler items to ever purchase.  When my daughter needs to go it isn't an issue finding a clean restroom.  I highly recommend to anyone who is potty training and beyond.
B0016KV73W I really couldn't even tell you how many times this little potty has saved my daughter's outfits, carseat, my van, and my sanity. I don't use it in public restrooms as we have something else we use for those instead. I keep it set up in my van with a bag already lining it (we ran out of those little bags that it comes with, with the absorbent pad to help soak up the liquid, but in a pinch, sassy disposable diaper sacks work wonders!!), and that way when we get the opportunity to pull over there's no wasting time trying to set it up while she does the potty dance. Not sure how it works with boys yet, as my youngest boy has not potty trained yet, but time will tell.Here's what I like:-convenience. I don't have to worry about trying to find someplace with a public restroom to take her in. I can quickly get her on it, take out the used bag, replace it with a new one, and be on the go again in no time.-portability. It doesn't take up much space at all when it is folded up and it fits fairly well in my diaper bag, and j
B0016KV73W We have been so pleased with our &#34;travel potty.&#34;  It is so compact and perfect for traveling.  It fits easily in a backpack or large purse so you can use it anywhere.
B0016KV73W Awesome product.  I travel a fair amount and didn't want to delay or jeopardize potty training my toddler because of my fear of getting stuck somewhere without a toilet.  I used this mostly on top of public toilets for the first few months - and it was GREAT for that.  It reduced the anxiety of my little one trying to go in strange places, especially when he had to sit for a while to, ahem, produce.  We used it on airplane toilets, you name it.  Then one day we were about to get on a subway train in NYC and he announced that he had to go pee... I pulled out the Potette, had it set up in seconds, and he was able to sit and pee in comfort (if not privacy!).  You really do have to push the legs hard to snap them into place so it is sturdy - but if you do that, it is strong enough to hold my 35lb little guy without a problem.  I also love that this is super small, lightweight, and easy to carry around.  Can't say enough good things.
B0016KV73W Like many others here, I had to learn the hard way why the standalone potty won't stay put and the legs kept slipping out from underneath my toddler mid-pottying. It's because each side needs to be pushed to lock in. Then the only caveat is that the legs sometimes pop out of the potty when I pull it back out to unlock it but it's a very minor incovenience compared to having the most accessible potty ever, which is so crucial especially when your toddler is potty training...and especially on vacation...to large parks where restrooms aren't always super accessible (not to mention the lines!)...via a road trip. I can't imagine how we could've survived our last vacation without it. Best invention ever (my husband and I kept saying to one another)! I do agree/have to admit that the seat is very small and very low...but any bigger and it would be a bother to carry around. It's difficult finding the balance between portability and usability when it comes to a portable toilet, but this company certainly made it work.
B0016KV73W I had high hopes for this based on the reviews that I read. Unfortunately, it was a great disappointment. It's really flimsy and quite frankly too small to be of any use for my 2-year-old son. Despite following the directions, it kept tipping over every time we used it. Don't waste your money on this. I recommend the smaller version of the Baby Bjorn potty.  We use that now whenever we go out. The quality of the Bjorn is far superior to the Potette.  That's my .02.
B0016KV73W We have tried so many potty seats that I've lost count.  This one is by far the BEST.  It is compact and fits in my 2 year old's little backpack.  It is very sturdy, and she's comfortable because she does feel like she is falling in.  It cleans up easily, travels well, and is cute.
B0016KV73W Potty training was a terrifying prospect for me, especially being out and about. At the same time, I didn't want to be stuck at home for weeks/months until my toddler was potty trained. We live quite far from &#34;town&#34; and that was another fear of mine. So I bought this more for the &#34;travel potty&#34; use than the &#34;trainer seat&#34; use. However, on our first excursion out with it, we used it both ways, and it is so useful! It's small enough that it fits easily in my 14&#34;x14&#34; wet/dry bag, with extra liners, change of bottoms, wipes, and a cloth diaper for wiping up messes. It's really easy to whip out in the very short amount of time my daughter has between &#34;I have to pee!!&#34; and actually going.Like at least one other reviewer has said, it's important to know that if you're going to use it as a potty, you need to kind of &#34;lock&#34; the legs into place by pushing them up into the seat part. Then, to fold back up, you just need to carefully pull the legs out one notch. To go from folded up to trainer seat, there's no locking into place necessary.The liners that come with it are really amazing. The absorbent pad holds most if not all of the pee my toddler releases at a time (it claims to hold 5oz) so I'm not just carrying around a bag of liquid. At the same time, $10.xx for 30 liners (when my daughter, who is still in the early stages of potty training, can pee 5 times in just a few hours) can get costly. So we've found that the small plastic garbage bags (4 gallon) are much more cost effective. (Our grocery store has a generic pack of 30 for $1.67.) If I'm really concerned about the bag of pee, I can throw some paper towels or even a cloth diaper in it. I still plan to buy the Potette Plus liners from time to time as a luxury item, or maybe if we're going on a trip where we might not be able to dispose of the bags in a timely manner. =)I've read that plastic shopping bags like from the grocery store would work well, and I could see that. But I don't know about you, but most of our plastic bags have holes in them, plus now more and more cities are going bag-less anyway, so it's nice to know the small garbage bags work, too.I've never tried any other 2-in-1 type travel potties like this, but I'm very, very happy with my purchase.
B0016KV73W A friend had referred this product to me when she was potty training her son. It is small enough to take everywhere you go and big enough where the child is comfortable. I have two: one in the car (because who likes using the public restrooms?) and the other in my bathroom (because I have a small bathroom, no extra room for another toilet).
B0016KV73W I cannot rave about this product enough - it has been an absolute lifesaver!  I LOVE that it serves dually as a trainer seat on a large potty OR a stand-alone mini-potty.It folds fairly flat, so it's easy to fit in a diaper bag (or even a large tote-style purse).  It's awesome when on-the-go (whether long car rides when you just need to pull over for a sudden need to potty break, or at a fair/carnival setting when port-o-potties are the only other option - and who wants to put a little kid through that?).  It's also great even for vacations or going to other's houses.  My daughter is very petite, and cannot sit on a regular-sized toilet or she will fall in.  We bring this everywhere with us.1000% worth every penny.  I would recommend this to everyone.
B0016KV73W This is really great and we have gotten lots of use from it! We have used it as a potty seat over toilet and it can also be used to keep in your car in case your child needs to use the potty. This is a great all in one potty seat and we really love it!
B0016KV73W I take this chair everywhere with me! It fits sturdily on every type of toilet seat I have tried it on. It has little rubber strips on the underside of the legs/seat support that hold it in place. It folds up small enough to fit in a side pocket of my diaper bag or a large purse. When my son uses it it puts him in the right position to entirely miss peeing on the seat (mothers of boys know this is important). My only complaint is that the splash guard in front is kinda wide. To allow him to sit comfortably I have to take one leg out of his pants and underwear, which also involves taking off a shoe. I don't mind this so much since he just turned two and is peeing in public places thanks to this potty but might be a bigger deal to other people. I have never used it as a stand alone chair but I know that the legs must be positioned to point down and then clipped into place to be sturdy. I have tried that part and found it to be very sturdy.
B0016KV73W This may be the best baby product I've bought. My daughter was recently potty trained when we had to go on a very long road trip through rural Oregon. We were very concerned that she would regress and bought this potty out of desperation. It worked wonderfully! The legs are very sturdy when locked in place and work well on uneven ground. The bags are super and we have not experienced a single leak. We've used the &#34;mergnancy potty&#34; everywhere from the back of the SUV to the park to the beach to the side of an interstate highway. It's compact enough to fit in my big purse, so it goes everywhere with us.
B0016KV73W A travel potty is an absolute must for potty training, especially in the early days.  It is literally the difference between a breakthrough success and yet another accident.  This travel potty is exactly what we need.  It's lightweight enough to fit in the diaper bag.  When the legs are snapped into place (which took me a few tries to get right), it is extremely sturdy.  My daughter feels very secure sitting on it - it's not wobbly at all.  It's a very smart design to allow it to be placed over a public toilet too, although we mainly use it as a stand-alone potty.  I keep a bag already loaded on so that it's ready to go at a moment's notice.  We have used it everywhere:  in the front seat, back seat, trunk, on the side of the road, in the park, everywhere.  The absorbent inserts in the bags are brilliant.  The bags contain messes perfectly; we've never had a mishap.  This potty seat affords us a LOT of confidence that even if the urge sneaks up on my daughter, we will still be okay.  Every potty training family needs one of these.
B0016KV73W We are loving this potty seat for our 19 month old. He is usually slow to warm up to new things, but took to this potty seat right away and has been going potty in public restrooms with no problems now. It fits conveniently in the diaper bag. Haven't used as a stand-alone potty seat yet, but can see that double duty can come in handy too. I like this item way better than my sister's quad fold dora the explorer seat for her daughter - that one is very flimsy and I think my son is comfortable on this seat b/c even though it is small and portable it is sturdier. Great buy for ten bucks!
B0016KV73W With the reusable liner we have been able to use the 2-in-1 potette plus at home, in the car, and while traveling.  Great product.
B0016KV73W Love it! Easy to transport, fits in a backpack or handbag. So convenient for potty training on the go. Came in very handy when we went camping.
B0016KV73W So happy with this purchase - and I was sceptical.  1-Because it good TOO many good reviews; and 2-My 2 1/2 year old newly potty trained daughter can be a little particular and dramatic about new things. But I was wrong and made a great choice in my purchase.  It even fits in my tote bag.  It comes with 3 pee bags and a plastic storage bag.  The extra bags and silicone seat insert/liner are separate, but well worth the extra purchase.  The potty does sit very low to the ground, and having a tall child made me think maybe she wouldn't like the way that felt but she is fine sitting low, even though her house potty's are higher.  We use the liner/insert at houses we visit because I can easily dump it and wipe; as well as the bags for in the car or at stores so I can just toss.  I prefer to use the Potette brand bags instead of using a garbage bag with paper towels as some suggested - you never know when there is a small leak.  The bags are easy to use and have little turtles in the bottom pad which make it fun for the child to tinkle on.  The pad is genius - nothing sloshes around!  Although when I have used the silicone insert in the car, I just put paper towels in the bottom and that works just as well. My only, very small, con is manuevering the legs/handles of the pot.  It is not easy.  You have to push each end of each leg/handle all the way in to click, to make it a sturdy sit-on-the-floor potty.  Then they snap out again to fold in to store, or to flip outward to use as a toilet seat.  Our babysitter has issues with this aspect so she actually pulls each handle all the way off, and folds them in and THEN snaps them in to store it. Otherwise she can't go from the locked to the fold position.  Even I have trouble.  But the more you use it the easier it is and it works so well otherwise I will deal with that.  This really is one of the best purchases I've made as a mom so far, it makes running errands with a toddler who doesn't like big toilets so much easier!
B0016KV73W Got this just for its dual purpose of being able to use on a regular toilet and on the go.  It is nice that it is small and portable but it is really tiny when you get it on a toilet.  It looks more ring like than seat like.  This is especially true if you have an elongated toilet bowl.  And if you have an elongated bowl the seat actually ends up sitting towards the back making it a little hard for the kid to climb on to.  The worst part for boys is that if you/they are not careful the design tends to allow \"sprayage\" all over the place as there isn't much room between the kids \"junk\" and the front of the bowl.  Have the Bjorn seat in another bathroom that works really well.  Will likely get another for home and keep this one in the care for outings only.
B0016KV73W I got two of these bc we were traveling and boy they were so uncomfortable.  After every time my toddler used it, you can see red marks on both sides of his thighs.We've only used it on top of the regular toilet seat, hadn't try it the other way like we were in the woods or something.
B0016KV73W We are not a fan of this product.  I have the Baby Bjorn ones inside the house which my son loves but he refuses to use this one when we are out and about.  The first time he sat on it it wasn't correctly locked in place and the potty gave way and he fell down.  He's been traumatized every since and now I just bring the Bjorn one along for the ride in the trunk and wasted all of my money on this.
B0016KV73W Great if you travel with a kid in potty training period. It is small enough to be carried around. It can fit even in a larger purse. It is very stable once it is locked in the position. The only problem is unlocking it. I end up with the handles in my hand every time I try to unlock it and I have to put the handles back. I do not know how long the plastic is going to resist to this maneuver.
B0016KV73W This is a great small size and fits comfortably in my bag. I love using this when we are out in public. It folds out nicely where my 2-1/2 year old can hold on to it's handles and not the icky public toilet seat. I love how it folds up very small.  Great product
B0016KV73W This has saved us on road trips on the side of the road and on icky public toilets while out running errands.  Holds up well and I pretty much don't leave the house without it.
B0016KV73W This is a great seat to keep in car for going public places, but not small enough to fit in my purse or anything. It is extremely low to the ground when used as a stand-alone potty, so not very useful for that. Will do in a pinch, but my daughter is 3 and already about to outgrown ability to use it on ground.
B0016KV73W Where do I start? I love love love this toilet seat. During my search for a portable potty for my daughter I looked at many different brands and options. But after reading many reviews for this I decided to give it a try even though I worried that it might be bigger than I wanted. When it arrived I knew then its the perfect size. It is such a life saver in many ways. It helped my baby girl toilet train because the kiddie ones with a bucket that you have to throw out is just a bit too gross for me. I do not leave the house without it. I thank god every time we are out and my daughter needs to go but we're at a super disgusting public toilet. I grab a bunch of the seat covers, layer them up and slap this on top and she's ready to go. We've used it in my car too for times that a public toilet is not around which is such a life saver. This way I'm not driving 100 mph looking for the next restroom stop and panicking that she might go in her pants. It is very sturdy and easy to clean. I would buy this again in a heartbeat.
B0016KV73W My daughter likes her little \"red potty\".  I keep it in the car for emergencies and when she was toilet training I put it in the stroller for walks too.  I like that the legs can fold flat for storage, and that they click into place to sit.  (It might seem obvious if you know it already, but wasn't obvious to grandma who borrowed it while babysitting.)  The bags are great and perfectly sized to smoothly cover the seat for no mess--expensive, but we don't use them that often.  I've also just set the seat out over grass/dirt and used it sans bag (what can I say, I'm cheap like that).  I've tried a grocery bag, but they are so crinkly and slippery, and the ink flakes off...so I prefer the bag made by Potette.  I like that it has bags b/c clean up is SO EASY!!!  I don't have to rinse out a little potty or find somewhere to rinse it or toss the TP/wipe.  That is by far the biggest plus!  Especially since my 2 yr old likes \"privacy\" so she likes it in the back of the SUV rather than on the ground in the parking lot.  It does sit very low to the ground, so it might be less comfortable for bigger toddlers, but that's a sacrifice for convenience and portability.
B0016KV73W During potty training this has been fantastic.  My daughter learned to potty train in a potty chair, but that meant pleading with her to pee before we left the house, and rushing home before the next &#34;potty.&#34;  Once we got this, it was easy to throw in my (large) purse and off we'd go.  She felt much more secure on large public toilets.  Not only that, you have the capability to turn this into an emergency potty chair by folding the legs down instead of out to the side.  It's great for long car trips because we don't have to race to the next exit to find a gas station.  We're able to put this in the hatchback trunk and just let her go there, in the provided liners (you could also use a plastic shopping bag -without holes!).This is great to even just leave in the trunk.
B0016KV73W I really like this product. I was a bit unsure of it at first because it looked so small. But we have used it in the public restrooms and at people's houses and it works great over a toilet. The arms fold out and click into place creating a sturdy seat. The arms also click into place creating a stool like seat for using without a toilet. We have not had the opportunity to try that out yet. As a travel potty it does fit well into a diaper bad. Surprisingly compact.
B0016KV73W This thing is awesome!  We keep it in the back of the car at all times.  My daughter is very afraid of &#34;big potties&#34; and this is our solution.  We buy the refill bags and it's so convenient.  I originally bought it for use on a trip and even brought it on the airplane. We still use it now.  On outings I just ask her if she needs to go (usually while exiting or entering the car) and I open up the back hatch of my car, she hops in and goes.  I keep a little pack of diaper wipes in the bag with it.  Then before walking into a store (or the park) I just tie up the bag and toss it in the garbage on my way in.  Nothing to clean up and I don't have to hunch over a public bathroom telling my daughter over and over to stop touching everything.  Sometimes we'll bring it to parks near us that don't have bathrooms.  We've been using this for about 10 months now and are only on our second pack of refill packs.  Totally worth it.
B0016KV73W Yes, its not the biggest place for a bottom to rest BUT proof is in the usage:My 3 year old didn't miss a beat (or the seat) the first time she used it. We keep it in the back of the car ready to go and she just hops on there when needed.  Its little legs were a little difficult to lock into place (and in-lock) the first couple of times but after that it was a cinch.  Once in place it is very stable.  They bags hold everythign well and its easy to get set up and packed away for next time.  Ideal for travel or a trip to the park when the porta potties are a little more aromatic than desired.
B0016KV73W We used this twice. It seriously was much easier to just hold my daughter over a public potty and wash our hands thoroughly than bring this in and take it with us. It's small, yes but it just wasn't fun to lug something else in and out of restaurants, the mall, etc. Plus I felt like we were just carrying germs around with us from one potty to another. It's sort of an unnecessary purchase unless you are using it for camping, the beach, etc. For public potties just use the potty.
B0016KV73W Only use this is a  toilet seat converter for my kiddos.  For this it works well and is nice & compact.  I have a Ju Ju Be Backpack and it fits inside the back zippered change mat section (after taking out the mat which I no longer need) Don't like it as a sit on potty though.  My daughter won't use it as I think it feels unstable to her.  I keep a Cool Gear Travel Potty  in the car for her to use if we can't find a toilet as it's sets up as a sturdy bench seat, it's also higher off the ground than this potette.  Works with the potette bags (or any plastic bag for that matter) so it's a fast disposal just like the pottette.
B0016KV73W Lifesaver for a potty-training 3 year old who is still mostly resistant. This removes the fear of &#34;falling&#34; into the toilet plus the handles keep his tiny hands away from the germ infested seat.  Works great with the Potty Cover or Potty Topper (provides added layer of protection / barrier).  The portability is also a plus. This is a MUST-HAVE for potty training parents.
B0016KV73W We've owned this for a few weeks now and it's simply THE BEST! Every parent with little ones potty training should get one of these! Our girl has used this potty-style in the back of our SUV, in the backseat of our sedan, on the side of the road, at the neighborhood pool, and seated-style on numerous public restrooms. I purchased the disposable bags with these and once I ran out, found a grocery store bag and 2 papertowels folded over works just as well and is more convenient and cheaper than the bags. This potty is comfortable for my girl, easy to transport (comes with a carrying bag), easy to use, easy to clean, convenient, inexpensive and has been invaluable for keeping in the car and using when the moment strikes! Great product! I might consider this my new go-to gift for new parents...even though they'd have to wait a few years until they can use it...it's that wonderful.
B0016KV73W Works great as a portable potty option.  My son is terrified of large public toilets and this makes him feel safe without me having to lug something large around.  The bag is great for keeping it thrown in my diaper bag.  The front is a little lower than his other one which has led to some unintentional spraying!  I have yet to try it as a travel potty.
B0016KV73W Our son hated kiddie potties.  He just went straight from diapers to the regular toilet.  I'm sure it would come in handy if you camped a lot, or traveled a lot, but it just didn't work for us.
B0016KV73W This potty seat is great! We use it daily in my son's bathroom at home, and it folds easily to take with us out of the house. It has fit every toilet seat we've put it on, with no problems. No touching germy public toilets! I can't say anything about using it as a portable potty since we've never tried it that way. But it was a great purchase, worth every penny!
B0016KV73W I bought this more to use on public toilets, and the ocassional stand along use.  My son isn't comfortable using it on the big toilet AT ALL.  I don't like that it sits on the very back of the toilet.  When his pants are pulled to the ankles, his legs then have to sit out straight, making sitting very awkward.  And I also can't tell whether he is 'pointed down' because his legs are in the way of me seeing.Perhaps this would be better to use in the back of a minivan or something during a long trip.  But I don't have a huge car, and I don't find it very useful for everyday shopping, errands, etc.
B0016KV73W Simply one of the best baby / kid products around. Folds and unfolds easily and works great as a stand-alone potty or an adaptor for a regular toilet. Lightweight and inexpensive, too.
B0016KV73W This is the perfect little potty for our uses: emergencies and on long car trips. I love that it can be used as a seat on a big potty, if you have that option, or on it's own with the bags. I have bought the liners that this company makes to go along with this potty because I like the ease of knowing there won't be spills or leaks if I were to use my own. I also like the ease of not having to carry around both grocery bags and something to put in the bottom of them (although that's a great idea in case I ever find myself without one of Kalencom's liner bags!).We are using this as an emergency potty for our kids ages 9, 6, and 2, although the 9 and 6 year old are able to hold it until we find an actual bathroom better than the 2 year old.
B0016KV73W After a week of potty training at home I knew I had to venture out and have my son sit on a public toilet. The potette fits perfectly on all the public toilets I've tried it on but it does require some getting used to. My son just turned 2 and is small for his age but he fits fine on it but it took a few tries to get him seated properly so he doesn't pee all over the place. I thought I would use the seat as a travel potty for the car as well but I tried sitting my son on it as a toilet and he fell right through to the floor. Since he has been trained on a real toilet with a potty seat he just wasn't used to sitting so low to the ground with nothing to hold on to.While it has been a life saver in public places, it is a pain in the butt to carry around. We rarely use a stroller so it's not an option to throw it in the basket underneath. And I was trying to get away from using a diaper bag anymore since my son is now potty trained. But this potty is just too large to fit in any purse that I own. So it's back to carrying a diaper bag for now and hopefully I can teach my son to pee standing up soon :)
B0016KV73W Pros:-has a raised upper lip so i'm not as scared of my boy peeing all over the place-sturdy ring that does not fold, so no worries about it caving or breaking or pinching-can work both as a potty seat or stand alone potty. we haven't tried the latter feature yet, but basically there are 2 folding legs on each side that fold in when not in use; fold out all the way like wings so that you can place on a toilet seat; & can fold legs 90 degrees to the potty seat itself so that it can be standingCons:-on the smaller side, but works fine for my little guy, who is on the smaller side**It's inevitable that whatever potty set you get, the yucky public toilet will be exposed to your child. So, our system is to bring a travel pack of sanitizing wipes and wipe the toilet seat and anything icky and tempting for toddler to touch (like flusher, sanitary napkin box, etc) and then place potty seat on top. Works great!
B0016KV73W It works as intended. We keep it in the car for our daughter and it can be used in public restrooms. There has been a few emergencies while she's been in the car seat. It's easy to pull over to a private spot, set up the Potette, and let her go. It's definately saved us from car accidents. Some people have complained that the legs fly out from under the seat. I have not found this to be an issue at all. The instructions show that when the legs are pulled out they need to be pushed up to \"click\" into the seat. It's solid when pushed into that position.EDIT: 12/2012 -- We still have this in our car. It's been a long time and still have the original one. It works great. No issues at all. Awesome when you are miles from a toilet and the little one says, \"I gotta go!\"
B0016KV73W This thing is awesome!!! it is great for road side emergency potty breaks, fitting onto the toilets when we're out and about, also for at home when my daughter was potty training. I appreciate that it comes in it's own carrying bag so I don't have to store it in one of my own bags. Easy to clean and the bags that it is sold with are perfect.
B0016KV73W Maybe this will be more useful in traveling when my daughter gets older, but it's not working for a toilet topper. It slides around too much and doesn't stay where it needs to stay. Also, it's so thin, it's not very comfortable for my daughter. I really liked the idea of this product though. I hope we can use it in the future.
B0016KV73W I love this one.  I looked at A LOT of portable potty seats when we got ready for potty training, and all of them seemed either too flimsy or too big.  This is the sturdy and relatively portable (depending on the size of your diaper bag).  I love that it can be used with the bags as a true travel potty as well as just a portable potty seat.
B0016KV73W I purchased this potty to prepare for the next step in potty learning, attempting to go outside sans diaper.We aren't there yet but boy howdy what a multi-functioning potty.During potty learning, I know some folks like to have a mobile potty available in every room for their child.  I wasn't keen on this idea.  Nor was my daughter.  When I took her potty out to clean the bathroom floor, she told me that her potty belongs in the potty next to Mommy and Daddy's potty.  We nixed the idea of moving the potty.Then one evening while she was getting ready for bed and giving the 10th excuse to get out of bed, she stated, \"I need to go potty.\"  I didn't want to stop her if she really needed to and felt telling her to go in her overnight would probably be confusing to her.  I also didn't want her to leave the bedroom.I quickly remembered the portable potty!  I grabbed it and opened it up and told her this was her special to go potty.  She loved it and now we keep it in the bedroom for when she has to go during bedtime.The size is just right for us.  It's not too big or small and is compact enough that we can slip it into our travel bag for trips to see family and friends.I love the bags that come with it.  They seem flimsy but do the job well.  Each bag has this square liner that helps absorb liquid.  It's not as absorbent as a diaper but it does the job.  You wipe, drop the wipes in the bag and just take the handles off the sides and tie it up and trash.  The bags have a light but pleasant scent that isn't too overpowering.The portable potty plus also gives you the option to make it a seat on top of a standard toilet.  I haven't tried this option yet but it seems sturdy enough.  Parts are made of rubber that seem to help with stability and no slip.A few tips that I culled from reading the manual and speaking to other parents:1.  If you open it up to be a portable potty, make sure to snap the legs closed so it doesn't collapse on your child.  The easiest way to do this is flip the legs down and put the potty on the ground.  Put your hands on top of the potty seat and apply pressure until you hear the clicking sound.2.  If you use it as a seat over the toilet, make sure the handle bars are also locked so your child's fingers don't get caught in between the seat and the toilet seat.3.  If you use it as a portable potty, you can leave a maximum of three bags on it.  This saves you from having to re-line it every time and the occasional, 'I'm not done yet!' and plop back onto the seat after you pulled the dirty bag off move.This potty is not for the very young or for those that cannot sit upright for long periods of time.  It is a portable potty so it only has the seat and does not provide any back support.  I only state this as some folks have early potty learners.  We started potty learning early, mainly so that Mommy didn't have to use the bathroom with a baby on her lap.  Because of such, we also have a backed Bjorn potty in the bathroom.  We started using the Bjorn at age 15 months as a chair.  We started using the portable potty at age 2.Hope this helps.
B0016KV73W I was so excited to try this little potty for an upcoming trip!  The only problem is that our little one doesn't like it.  She is a very petite (21 pounds, 32 inches) 19 month old and the ring is too big for her.  She looks very uncomfortable on it like she feels she is going to fall through.  It also sits too low to the ground for her.  We will keep it around and hope that maybe she will grow into it and it will be a our \"go-to\" travel potty.  But for now we will search for something else.
B0016KV73W This is okay.  I thought it would look a little more like a toilet, but it's working for my husband's half attempts at &#34;elimination communication.&#34;  He hates diaper changes and saw this as a way of training a four-month old to pee in a toilet.  I think it will likely be helpful when we really take on toilet training--especially for trips.
B0016KV73W This is a great little travel potty and we have also used it as a portable toilet seat for public restrooms.There are a couple of things that could improve it though.  The legs are so short that even a 34 inch child does not look comfortable sitting on it.  Also, do not allow children to fold the chair back together.  It is easy to pinch your fingers if you are not careful.The Kalencom PLUS works as a toilet seat too for public restrooms and it does the job.  However, I do not like this seat as a portable toilet seat for three reasons. With boys the pee can hit the wrong spot and splatter; the seat is lumpy; and it slips a bit on the toilet.  This product is best used as just a travel potty and it is good for that.  It is nice you can put three of the disposable bags on it in advance and be ready for emergency potty stops.
B0016KV73W This is GREAT for our newly potty training son. Fits great on a regular toilet lid for out and about, and easy to use for stand alone times (saved us at the beach from having to stand in a long line for the restroom for him). I love it and can't say enough great things about it. My only wish (and this is being super nit picky) is that the splash gaurd would be bigger (for boys). But that is just being super pic
B0016KV73W I love this thing. It was well worth the money spent. We use it all the time. It will adjust to fit any toilet and my daughter feels safe and secure using it. I hate using public restrooms, but this thing makes the whole process a little more palatable. I leave it in my car in a small bag (along with a little container of antibacterial wipes) and it goes into the stroller when we are the zoo, mall, church, etc. One of my favorite features---and one that you definitely can't tell from the image shown---is that when it is folded out, there are little handles for the kid to hold onto. My daughter loves that and I love it that she isn't gripping a public toilet. We haven't had to use it in the &#34;stand-alone&#34; position yet. Circumstances just haven't required it. But someone said that you can make your own bags for it by cuttting a sanitary pad in half, sticking it in a plastic grocery sack. The pad absorbs liquid and you just tie it up and toss. Sounds fine to me. I have a couple in my car in a little pouch for the time when that happens. Very happy with this purchase.
B0016KV73W I got this for my 2 year old who we'd just potty trained. I didn't want to get caught short in the car away from the bathroom, but I also didn't want a great big potty in the trunk of the car. This is great, it folds small. To use it as a travel potty, you click the legs, add the bag and away they pee (you can buy 'special bags' but a diaper bag with a bit of paper towel in the bottom would work as well.) I read some reviews that it collapses when the kids are on it, but if you click the legs in properly, it does not.To use on the toilet just extend the legs like the wings on a airplane, pop it on the seat and them on top.It folds small enough for the diaper bag too!
B0016KV73W I can't explain how impressed and happy i am with this product. I bought it for my 2 year old for a camping trip but we had an emergency and we travelled in the philippines. It made our life a lot easier because we don't have to rush and stop somewhere when my daughter needs to potty. We used it when we are out and i don't feel comfortable about my daughter using the public toilets and we even use it inside the car ( i just sit her in the back) .. This product was worth every penny, i highly recommend it if you travel a lot and good for those who are starting potty training
B0016KV73W I bought this product for my twin girls who are almost 2 and a half and we've been using it for almost 2 months now. It's the best travel potty ever! Folds very easily and can fit in a medium-sized bag. Super easy to use. Nice color. We tried another potty before this one and one of my little girls kept saying &#34;it hurts, mommy&#34;. We never had such a problem with this potty. We've traveled with it the whole summer and it's been a lifesaver on so many occasions! I can't imagine traveling without it! I do think that the liners are overpriced but that's not too big an issue -- You can always use this potty with other small plastic bags. Highly recommended.
B0016KV73W My two year old just started potty training and I knew we would need something we could use when we are out of the house. I love that it can be used as a stand alone potty or as a seat on a regular toilet. This potty usually gets used as a stand alone with the bag inserts, which I really like and are biodegradable. We haven't used it for long so I don't know how durable it will be but it does seem to be pretty good quality plastic and will hopefully last through two kids. It's sturdy when the legs are locked in place and pretty small when folded down. Our toddler seems to feel secure on it as it gets used frequently. I'm really glad we bought this and for the price you can't beat it.
B0016KV73W Bought for traveling with twin 2-year-olds.  When placed on a regular toilet, this seat bends a bit at the seams when the kids sit on it.  This makes them feel unsteady.  They rejected it completely at first.  On a second trip, they were a bit more willing to try, but still not as comfortable as the Bjorn seats we use at home.  Very small when in the stand-alone position.  Might work better once they're actually potty trained instead of just starting.
B0016KV73W We kept this in the back of the car and used it several times.  It works great, and is so easy to clean up.  Love it!
B0016KV73W This potty is great for my two year-old.  It's a potty seat when the legs are folded out and a travel potty when the legs are down (and a baggie is inserted).  As a potty seat, I like that it creates a barrier between my daughter and that toilet seat gap most public toilets have.  It's also stable enough (on most toilets) for me to stand back and let her go on her own (per her request) without slipping or sliding about.  We've also had to use it three times as an emergency travel potty and it's been great.  My only complaint is that my daughter likes going on it so much that one of those frantic stops was a total fake; she just wanted sit on it.It fits in my diaper bag and doesn't add that much bulk or weight.  Although it's always with me, I find that I only use it as a potty seat now when the toilet is particularly icky.One last thing -- it comes in a travel bag that is just a thick, white plastic bag with a drawstring top.
B0016KV73W We use this potty often, and although the seat is small it seems to serve its purpose. My son adapted to it easily and never had any issues. My only complaint is buying the bags. They can be costly when you use it as often as we do. And any new child learning to potty train will need to go before entering the store, and when coming out of the store! I also only have 1 store nearby that carries these bags, and once there shelves are empty I am out of luck until they get more in. I have used a shopping bag in a pinch, but be forwarned they are not usually leak proof. I have also used small garbage bags with a maxi pad which served its purpose but can also be a disaster as the bag would stick to my sons bottom as he would stand, and also while out in public it looked ridiculas. Wish they made some type of adapter or someway to use diaper diaposal bags as this would be more cost effective and easier. 
B0016KV73W I was so excited to find this potty. It was exactly what we needed for being on the go, as my son doesn't like to use toilets yet. The major drawback though is that when my son goes pee, the pee goes everywhere since there isn't an effective splash guard. Otherwise, this is great for #2. We haven't yet tried it over the big toilet since my son prefers a potty and is a bit fearful of toilets, even with this over the seat.
B0016KV73W We have loved this potty - it's easily portable and works great at home too.  It's our all around potty for our 2 1/2 yr old.  Some reviewers said the seat was small - we haven't found that to be the case but he does seem less comfortable on it than he is on his little potty that has a foam/rubber ring for comfort (he squirms a little on this seat).  However, now that he's not sitting on the potty just waiting to go, he does just fine on this seat for the length of time it takes him to potty.  I would have given this 5 starts if it seemed a little more comfortable for him.  
B0016KV73W Haven't used it a lot yet but so far this is great.  Has been sturdy and comfortable on toilet.  Haven't used it alone but when snapped in properly seems it will be fine.  Bought another to keep in each car.
B0016KV73W I keep this in the back of my car for those emergency situations where my little one can't get to a potty. So handy to have this! It has saved me several times.
B0016KV73W I have one in each of our cars and one in the stroller. Our nanny hates going to public restroom in the part because a lot of homeless people go there so she will use the potette every day letting our daughter do her business in the park. The bags are a bit expensive but grocery bags so often have holes I'd rather be safe than sorry. I have also used it in restaurants when they have no seat liner and I still put some toilet paper on the toilet seat towards the front that the potette doesn't cover. Many times we have pulled over or exit freeway to find a parking lot where my daughter can go potty. One times she did it inside our car but she bent her leg too high and the pee kinda squirt out of the potette so I make sure she straighten her legs when she as to pee. Overall it is a great product. You do have to make sure the legs snap in place when using as a chair. IMO, even if I only use it once it is totally worth the money so my daughter doesn't have to touch any dirty toilet seat or when she needs to go while we are driving somewhere.
B0016KV73W We do not go anywhere without the potette in our car!  We have been using the same one for about 2 years now and it is fantastic.  It is small enough to fit in your diaper bag (really, smaller and lighter than you would think) and incredibly sturdy.  Those who commented that it is not sturdy are not properly snapping it into place.  I had this problem initially, but once I got the hang of it, it is sturdy enough for even a very desperate adult ;)  We usually don't bother with the bags - we just find a nice patch of grass on the side of the road (we live in the country) and let the pee hit the grass - works like a charm!
B0016KV73W Caution for boys - the splash guard is a little too short to stop spray from coming out under splash guard and back up onto their pants when used on an adult toilet, and if bag liner isn't on just right - and definitely if you try without any liner.  The reusable liner has saved us lots of trouble and made this a good park/travel potty.  Second Caution is that you have to really make sure to click the legs into place just right or it collapses and pinches small fingers when set up as stand-alone travel potty.  Even after reading directions and thinking I was doing it correctly, it took a friend with the same potty to show me how to really get the legs all the way clicked into place before we stopped having trouble.  We now love it for taking out and about as a small potty.
B0016KV73W I keep this thing in my car, and make sure I take it on every trip. Because as you know, as soon as you leave the gas station....somebody has to go potty right there and then!!! I like that the legs fold, it doesn't take up space! and then you tie the bags and you throw them away! Super clean!
B0016KV73W fantastic product! I recently brought it along to our 2 week trip to China. It was so handy I cant say enough good things about it! Product works perfectly and so convenient. In the hotel room it works perfectly as the toilet seat. When we were out, I have had to use the bag a couple of times when my son had to poo and pee. Toilets were hard to find, CLEAN toilets were very rare, so needless to say, it was a lifesaver! It was however kind of short for my 4 year old son. Even when set up, it was quite short and he was a little uncomfortable but he just had to do his thing and he was off. Still a 5 star for me. If they would make it a little more comfy for the little one would be amazing. Highly recommended for parents with toilet going kids!
B0016KV73W This is a great seat to use with the liners and to have in your car. But when put on a toilet it is a very large opening and no splash guard and not very comfortable. Since the opening is wide, it was difficult for my 2year old to sit for any long period of time. We took it on our vacation but probably won't be doing that again. It's going to live in my car and used for roadtrips and emergencies. On vacation I'd still take another more comfy seat that will stay in the hotel or the fold up kind to use in my diaper bag. The liners are great tho!! Nothing else out there like this seat plus liners.
B0016KV73W I wanted to love this potty. I read all of the reviews and was so impressed by how many people raved about it. I think it would work great for a young two year old. However, I bought this when my son had just turned three. My son is very slim at only 50th percentile for weight yet he complains that the potty is too small and uncomfortable to use. He also complains that it is too low to the ground and he feels like he will fall off of it. So, this travel potty is going in storage until my daughter turns two, when I will try it out on her.I do like the design of the potty. It is very compact and folds up nicely to fit in a diaper bag for easy travel. I did find the legs to be a bit tricky to get to pop out (to set up the seat for use) and back in (for storage). I havent used the potty that much though so maybe with increased use I will get better at popping the legs of the potty in and out.I also have to pass on a trick that has worked well for us when we are away from a toilet with my 3 year old son. If you take a large sized zip loc bag and let him pee in there it works rather well. You just seal it up or pour it out and dispose of it. Obviously, this only works well 1) for a boy and 2) for peeing only.So, in sum, because it is so small and low to the ground be mindful of this if you are buying it for a 3 year old or for a larger sized two year old. And even if your child fits on the seat, if they are used to sitting higher up on other potty chairs, such as the bjorn potty, they may feel awkward or like they are going to fall off when they sit on this low to the ground seat and they may refuse to use it. From my experience with this travel potty thus far, I probably wouldn't buy it again, but since I have it I am going to hang onto it and give it another try when my daughter turns two.
B0016KV73W This was a lifesaver at the beach while my daughter was potty training. I highly recommend it. Works great on its own or as a potty seat on an adult toilet. Great purchase.
B0016KV73W Potty training is not an easy process. This 2 in 1 potty/seat helps a lot with the process. I take it everywhere with me. I mostly use it as a seat but there were a few times where I used it as a potty and it worked perfect (During a picnic, in the car once when parked..)The bags are expensive but I bought them anyway. You never know when you will need them. It's been a year and I still plenty of them left just because I use this product as a seat more often then a potty (As a potty in emergencies or places with no restrooms or with really filthy ones!!)Great buy :))
B0016KV73W My 3 year old is very afraid of going to a loud public bathroom. This has come in handy every time we go out. I do t buy the bags and found if I just use a plastic bag (like target thick bags) with some paper towels it works perfectly. I highly recommend this to everyone with a toddler
B0016KV73W We keep one of these in the back of our SUV.  It's a perfect solution to when you LO needs to go and you don't have a toilet to use or for potty training.  It's small enough to fit in a diaper bag, pool bag, beach bag.  Goes everywhere with us!  And the liners are a must have.  They make it super clean and easy!
B0016KV73W we are about a week into potty training and so far this is my son's preferred potty seat.  we also have a little frog potty and a seat that sits on a regular toilet, but I guess this is the one he finds most comfortable.  I bought the reusable liner and I definitely recommend it if you plan on using this seat as more than just a travel toilet.Cons: I haven't tried using this as a travel option yet.  It seems like it would be kind of difficult at first, as it takes a minute to set up, too long for a newly trained child in my opinion.  I'm not thrilled with it as a seat on a regular toilet.  My son kind of sinks into it and the hard plastic leaves red marks.  Also, it doesn't work with a potty hook and we only have one small bathroom so I need something that saves space.Overall, if my son likes it then it's a winner and I like that it has three functions.btw grocery store plastic bags work well too
B0016KV73W This portable toilet is GREAT!! It is easy to set up, thoguh I never use it on adult public toilets, it feels gross. I can set it up in any corner, even at the mall and no one knows. The bags are biodegradable which is also great. They have absorbent pads in them to hold the pee too. It is small and has a bag to carry. Really a must for any one with small kids!
B0016KV73W Legs wont click into place and keeps falling down when my little 25lb daughter sits on it. It squeezed her fingers as it fell down and now my daughter refuses to use it. Its a great idea but if the legs don't stay in place and falls, its useless. This is going right back to amazon. I am disappointed as I really think its a good concept. Hopefully I just got a lemon.
B0016KV73W We keep this in the bottom of the stroller and it has saved us many times.Early on in potty training, it came in quite handy when our toddler had the sudden need to go to the bathroom and there was no restroom.  This quickly opens and solves that problem.We also use it often on public toilets.  Not only is it more hygienic, but also much less scary for our toddler than using some strange new toilet in a strange public restroom.It is a bit frustrating to pay for the extra bags.  They look just like plastic shopping bags with a swatch of paper towel inside.  However, the difference is that these bags never have any holes.  When you are carrying a bag full of urine to the trash can, you'll be happy it is the Kalencom bag that never leaks.
B0016KV73W This portable potty is wonderful -- it fits on every toilet we've tried (very old, small, round toilets can be a bit of an issue, but then you can fit it on the bowl instead of on the seat and it still works just fine), and it works as a portable stand-alone potty as well. It folds up small enough that it isn't annoying to bring it everywhere -- even on airplanes -- and is very sturdy!And with the high weight limit (96lbs), I have no worries about my son (30lbs at 22mos) outgrowing the seat before he's done potty-training.
B0016KV73W My toddler trained early (22 months) and is a little on the short side. Doing our business while we're out and about has been challenging because pulic toilets are so big. AND, I think not having an option for I'm while we're out was sending him mixed messages. I bought this today and we stopped for lunch- he announced he needed to go and he used it right away- no hesitation. In fact, he was even excited because it was just his size. It's small enough to fit in my bag and I'm going to carry it everywhere. I'm not sure how it will be for bigger kids but for my dude it was perfect.
B0016KV73W We always tell my son to &#34;point down&#34; when he pees, but it still will spray out of this. There is a gap between the set cover and the actual seat so I wish it would go down further to prevent sprays. Overall it is a decent product and good for quick trips to the potty, and taking in public.
B0016KV73W My son is on the small side for a twenty month old boy.  I purchased this product after I realized that he would not use the big potty at his sister's swim practice, and he was refusing to wear anything but his big boy pants... They sell this product at a major toy store for very little money so I bought it there.  For putting it on a big potty it works WONDERFUL.  No issues there at all.  The size is great for carrying with you, and the bag that comes with it is a nice touch.  My only issue is that when I set it up as a stand alone potty and my son promplty sat down on it, it collapsed.  I tried it again, same thing (much more reluctant child though).  I was not able to get it to click into place, which is apparently the problem... I do think its worth the money though, especially if you get one that will click into place.  Sure its small, but this is for babies as young as 15 months.. bigger toddlers/pre schoolers will likely need something else.
B0016KV73W This was a potty training piece of awesomeness. Flexible for traveling, and easy for our 20 month old to sit on. During her 3 day potty training weekend we kept this handy, carrying from room to room, for &#34;pit stops.&#34; It saved our floors from a lot of extra scrubbing. I call it our porta-potty as it goes everywhere with us for potty time emergencies (we've used it by the side of the road, in a park, in the back of our SUV...) and also as her toilet ring seat in public restrooms. It folds up and fits in its own carrying bag along with a spare set of training pants and small pack of flushable wipes. That kit in turn fits in my tote bag or beneath the stroller. Regular grocery bags work fine, just make sure they don't have any little holes in them!
B0016KV73W I was skeptical about this one but, as soon as the UPS man delivered it my 2  year old boy wanted to go on it.  I let him go 1 time inside but, told him after that it was an outside only potty.  We have used it at least 6 times in 2 days and I'm mostly very pleased with it.  Setup is very easy (just make sure you hear the click when locking the legs in place) but, the built in deflector is somewhat small.  Until he learns to \"hold it down\" we are going to have to take off his pants and training pants so his legs sit wide enough that \"it\" points down automatically (you Mothers of boys know what I'm talking about).  Also unlocking/folding the legs was a little hard the first couple of times but, it seams to get easier every time.  I looked at a couple different portable potty chairs before deciding on this one.  The other 2 options were both bulky and 1 didn't have a deflector and the other sealed so you had to carry the \"waste\" home and clean it out.  Overall, I am very pleased with this seat.
B0016KV73W This is the best $10 I have ever spent!One week after my son turned 2, he decided that he was going to use the toilet and no more diapers.  While I applauded his desire and determination, I had a feeling the &#34;ability&#34; might take a bit of time to perfect.  So, after seeing the &#34;special potties for using on the go&#34; in one of his potty books, I took to Amazon to find out what these on the go potties are.  For $10, I decided to try the potette plus--and have now purchased 3 potette plus-es!These things are A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! They are little folding 'potties' that can be set up as a small potty OR (bonus!) placed upon a full sized adult toilet seat to make it child sized.  The legs easily snap into place to set the potette up as a potty and easily extend out to use as a child's seat on the adult toilet.  It is the PERFECT size for the &#34;mommy, I have to potty&#34;, as soon as you make your turn onto a busy street--you can easily pull off into the closest parking lot or parking space, set up the potty on the car seat, floor, hatchback, folded down seat, what have you, so that junior can make his pee pee, after telling you for the 5000th time before you left the house 1 minute earlier that he did not have to go.Pros:  Fits perfectly in the diaper bag where we used to keep the changing padEasy to set up and use; for a portable potty, stick in one of the included liners (replacements are available for a reasonable price too--they look like plastic grocery bags with an absorbent pad at the bottom), and prop up the potty for junior to use (we keep it set up in the car--we fold down the front passenger seat and let junior sit on his throne on the folded seat.  It's saved us many a time from an 'unforeseen car seat incident' as grandpa would call it.  Also perfect for bathroom-less parks, the beach, or anyplace else that your little one has to go while &#34;on the go&#34;.  Once junior does his business in the disposable liner, you remove the bag, tie up the handles, toss it in the trash and go about your day.Easy to use on the adult potty.  My little guy was public restroom (or any restroom that was not at home) a-phobic.  He REFUSED to use toilets that were not his own, which made leaving the house while potty training extra fun.  After we got the potette, every toilet seat looks alike! (because the potette is nicely propped on top and that is all the little one sees).The legs/handles keep junior from grabbing those germ infested toilet seats in public restrooms to hold on--he can just hang on to the legs/handles of the potette plus and keep his precious hands free from public toilet yucks.Cons:  We didn't realize that the legs snapped up into the potette to stabilize it when used as a potty.  We learned that after a couple of wobbly attempts.  Make sure that you snap the legs in place when using as a free standing potty.Overall, it has made potty training a breeze.  We never had to spend those long dreaded weekends at home because junior was learning to use the toilet.  We just bring the potette plus with us and he's good to go &#34;on the go&#34;.  We keep 1 in each car and 1 in the diaper bag.  It seems like nothing brings on the urge to potty like getting strapped into the car seat and pulling out of the neighborhood.
B0016KV73W I carried this potty in my purse (it barely fit) while my daughter was potty training. I hardly had to use it, but it was good to have. I carried plastic grocery bags and napkins to put at the bottom of the bag to absorb pee.Negatives:- It takes more than a few seconds to set-up, so if she really needs to go, she might not make it, and you're breaking a sweat.- She has to be okay with sitting down on plastic, because the plastic bag wraps around the seat.- The folding out and collapsing of the legs could improve in designPositives:- portable- pink- can use grocery bags and then throw away immediately
B0016KV73W This is a very good product for girls.  It's easy to use, fits well inside the toilet and my daughter has something to hold on to.
B0016KV73W This seat is perfect.  After looking at all of the travel potty seat options, I chose to buy this seat for my three-year old for our recent road trip.  It couldn't have worked better.  It has fit on every public and home toilet that we have found.  My daughter feels safe on it and really likes it.  She always asks if I have it, even if we are just going out to the park or store.  Plus, she is most comfortable holding on to it while using it, which means her hands stay away from the public potty.We have also used it once in its free-standing mode.  It worked great!  As long as you clip the legs in properly, it is very secure.  Anyone who has had problems with it collapsing must not have had it clicked in right.The only drawback is that you have to buy their bags, if you are going to use it without a toilet.  But their bags are great -- they have a pad for absorbing pee, and are super easy to attach and detach.  When we run out, I will probably try to use regular plastic bags in an attempt to save money, but will probably eventually cave into buying more of their bags because they are so easy and mess-free.  Plus, since it fits on every toilet we've found, I doubt I will use it in its free-standing mode very often.Bottom line -- WELL worth the money.  Great product.
B0016KV73W I love the idea, and while my 3 year is not opposed to using it when we are out it is SO low to the ground.  I have to help him squat down so far and it looks so uncomfortable.  He has missed it comepletely and made huge messes in the back of my car.  I wish the legs could extend somehow.  Great for smaller kids I guess.
B0016KV73W This product is amazing. It gives me piece of mind that my kids (and I!) will always have where to go. Is true that you gotta make sure that the legs of the potty SNAP securely before your child sits on it (I forgot to do this the very first time and the potty collapsed on one side), so make sure it snaps in place. I attached a picture of how the potty looks on a public toilet. It is sturdy for my 2 year old... even tho I still put some toilet paper on the toilet UNDER my potette just in case LOL. Fits my diaper bag, which is normal size... I love this thing.
B0016KV73W Just got it for my potty training daugther, who usually needs to go like now.  We now take it everywhere.  We liked the bags, but ended doing what I read in a review, which is just using regular bags with paper towel on them and it works like a charm (make sure the bag doesn't have any holes like many of them sometimes do).  It has saved us from having to put our daughter to pee under a tree, having to stop and look for a restaurant or something, and things like that.
B0016KV73W Yeah, it's a great idea.  Now, does it work?  Yes!  When it comes down to it, people are talking about two things about this seat.  ONE, there might be a issue for boys because the ring is on the small side; TWO, PUSH IN THE LEGS for the stand alone position.  My daughter wobbled over the first time; so I checked everyones' comments, and now it's great.  Bottom line, great for the occasional emergency.  We all have been there in the dirty gas station thinking we will burn EVERYTHING when we get home.  Great alternative.
B0016KV73W LOVE LOVE LOVE!! My daughter is sort of leery of new things. So I was prepared to fight for her to use this. Boy was I wrong&#8230; She wanted to replace the potty seat we have in the house with this one that I bought for the car :)It is very sturdy. My daughter is 32lbs and not sure of the stat but very tall for her ago (almost 3 years) and she uses it just fine!
B0016KV73W I love this potty seat, it's small and convenient.  My daughter does not hesitate to get up on it in a public restroom.  It fits on the toilet and does not move around, I have found this true on all shapes of toilets.  The rubber handles holds it in place.  I have not used it on the &#34;go&#34; where it stands on his own but it seems sturdy enough if it had to be used that way.  It's small enough that it fits in a small diaper bag.  The rubber handles fold up into the seat to make it smaller.
B0016KV73W After using this for a few months in my house for my 3yr 2mo old granddaughter, I put it away to use only for trips to the park, beach etc. and bought anotherArm & Hammer Secure Comfort Potty Seat, Colors May Varyfor my second bathroom that she uses. Here's why:1. The portability of this product is great for use outside the home. It folds easily and compactly. It also can be used as a standalone toilet when nothing else is available.2. So what's the problem with home use? When the legs are pushed up and locked into place, this just isn't stable on the toilet seat. My granddaughter has complained that sometimes it \"pops up\", which is absolutely true. Unless your child sits perfectly in the center of the seat when sitting down, and also gets up without shifting weight to one side, this seat will indeed pop up. That problem doesn't exist when using this as a standalone potty since the legs are facing down.Bottom line: This is a very handy item for day trips, but not something I recommend as a regular potty seat at home.Update April 28, 2014: I've been taking this along when we go out to different places to eat. It's relatively compact to bring, and since I don't let my granddaughter go into a public bathroom alone (unlike when she uses the bathroom in my house), I just hold it in place so it doesn't pop up when she uses it.
B0016KV73W We keep this potty in the car. My daughter is 2, and she loves it. You can just use a grocery bag and a paper towel, but I would double the plastic bag.
B0016KV73W This doesn't fold up as compactly as some seats, but this isn't only for placing on top of a toilet like most are. My DD absolutely REFUSES to go on public toilets, so this has been a wonderful solution for us. And, when she is finally ready for them, this will give her the comfort of being the same thing she's used to going on. It doesn't fold up very well if you have the reusable liner on it, but the disposable ones let it collapse completely as it should. However, my DD will only use the reusable liner (the crinkly plastic of the disposable ones bug her), so I can say that if you do fold the seat with the reusable liner on it, the liner takes the abuse of the legs folding into it well without damage. (The reusable is so easy to clean that I've yet to use a disposable liner, so I don't know how well those work). Also, in potty chair formation, it is low to the ground, but this makes going &#34;#2&#34; a lot easier for the child and encourages them to make that step of potty training (or it did for my DD who wouldn't until we got this).The folding mechanism takes some getting used to, but is quick once you do. It is very important that you make sure that the legs are fully clicked into the seat before use though or it will be unstable -- properly clicked, it's fine. We've not used it as a seat on top of a toilet, so I can't speak to that much except that it's so wide when in that formation it won't worry me that the seat will shift and fall into the toilet like some seats do (shift, probably, but not fall).
B0016KV73W Took this on a trip to Asia with our 2 1/2 year old daughter and it was a lifesaver when only squat toilets were available.  Was really surprised at the size - it really did fit in my purse (kind of a medium-sized purse); takes up about as much room as the plastic fold-into-quarters potty seat that we use in public in the US.  Bought the liners as didn't want to be figuring out yet one more thing at the moment of truth.  We normally use public facilities at home but will now carry this as a back-up in the event that we aren't near a rest-stop, or that they are dirty.  Very easy to set up and use - little one wanted to try it as soon as I took it out of the box from Amazon.  Would recommend this to anyone who plans long road trips; trips to other countries where facilities are different styles; or who would like another option when regular facilities are just too foul.
B0016KV73W Okay, I realize that I am putting up a review on a potty seat. Never thought I'd do that but here I am.This is an awesome product. My girls (4.5 and 2.5) love using it when we are out and about because it doesn't move around once it's places on a toilet. I had another foldable potty seat that I used to carry around and I have now chucked it. This one is small enough to be carried in my diaper bag and I like that it comes with a pouch. It's easy to wipe clean and has nice handles they can hold on to while they are using it. All in all, very happy with this purchase and I will definitely be recommending it to other friends.
B0016KV73W Bought this product based on all of the positive reviews and it's a life saver.  We used it everywhere.  Great toilet seat minimizer and very sturdy portable potty.  Makes traveling with a little one so much easier but helpful for being out and about too.  I don't buy the special bags, just use the regular grocery bags.
B0016KV73W My child is scared of &#34;big potties&#34;. When we are on the road or out shopping, this is the lifesaver for &#34;I have to pee now daddy!&#34;. We love it.
B0016KV73W I bought it for my two years old girl. We used it in an airplane, in restaurants rest rooms, in a back of our car, on a toilets anywhere we go and it is always with us. Very small and comfortable to care in a bag. I purchased a waterproof diaper bag for this potty so I fill very comfortable to care it around.
B0016KV73W What a great concept and easy to use.  I have a potty training 3-year-old and a long commute each day.  My daughter goes to daycare in my office building, so unfortunately she must endure the 45 minute commute each way.  Sometimes she can't make it until we get to our destination, so having this travel potty stashed in the back of the SUV has been a lifesaver.  Not only does she think it's fun to use, but even if I don't have easy access to a trash can, the liners do an excellent job on containing the urine until I can safely throw the bag away.  Some people have suggested the use of plastic grocery bags instead of buying the liners.  Unfortunately, I find grocery bags often have small unseen holes in them and do not have the wonderful absorbent pad inside.  Spend the few extra dollars to get the liners that are intended to be used with the potty - you will thank me later!  I also like the fact that the potty comes in a nice storage bag - it keeps it clean while sitting in the back of the SUV and is a great place to store the extra liners.  We don't go anywhere without this potty.  No matter how hard you try to get your toddler to use the potty before you leave somewhere that has a toilet, we all know that it will be only 5-10 minutes later when they actually decide they have to go.
B0016KV73W This saved us from having to find a place for our toddler to go potty in the middle of a family friendly Mardi Grass parade! My girl is also scared of public toilets that have seats that are open at the front edge (which is almost every public toilet seat) so we have had a hard time using public toilets until we got this seat :) Super compact, it will fit inside our backpack! and leave plenty of space for the rest of the things my newborn needs! It comes with a plastic bag so I can just wipe it clean and put it in the bag and it won't touch anything else inside the backpack! We also bought the reusable rubber liner and with both of them we are set to go anywhere! We use this for our adventures out and about and it gives me peace of mind knowing that my baby's buns and little hands won't touch any nasty public restroom toilet seat.
B0016KV73W I have twin toddlers and have several potties/seats at my house.  I LOVE this little seat.  It was the last one that I bought, but it is definitely worth the investment!  For portable potties, I also own:Fisher-Price Potty On-the-GoGinsey Dora Folding Travel Potty SeatIf I had to pick one, the Potette 2-in-1 would probably be it - mainly for its versatility.  This potty can stand alone and be used with the bags that come with it, or, you can use shopping/trash bags (I just use a roll of 4 gallon bags purchased at Target or a \"dollar\" store).  You can also use this potty on top of a real potty by opening the legs.  One of my girls is not a fan of public restrooms and will not use a big potty, but, I can offer her her own (potette) potty, and she'll use that one.  Her sister is willing to use the public potty, and I can use this same potty by putting it on the big potty.  This potty is small enough that it will fit in your purse, backpack, or diaper bag.  The \"carry bag\" that comes with it is just a small plastic bag - nothing fancy.  I have girls, but the front/back of the potette seat has higher edges to act as a spray-shield.  The seat can fit either direction.  The only \"negatives\" I have found is that it fits funny on elongated seats (works but sometimes you have to set the seat all the way to the front or back) and sometimes you have to fiddle with the legs to get them to pop in to the right place (when locking or unlocking).  If you lock the legs properly, the seat is stable (at least for my 30 pounders).The Fisher Price potty is very hard to find, but you can find it online if you search (for a reasonable price).  This potty is VERY stable and has a much larger seat.  We take this with us on trips in addition to the potette but leave it in the truck and carry the Potette in our bag.  I use the same 4 gallon bags.  This potty comes with a really nice shoulder carry bag that includes pockets for \"urine pads\" and bags.  The legs are super easy to pop in to place and to close.  The only negative is that it doesn't work on big potties (it wasn't designed to - but just thought I'd mention it in comparison).The Ginsey folding seats are just too flimsey and they slide all over the place.  Sure, it folds up nice and small, but for a few bucks more, I think the Potette is a better investment.I also own:Baby Bjorn Potty Chair,BABYBJ&Ouml;RN Toilet Trainer - White/Black, BRU potty/seat, two seats like these:Ginsey Dora Soft Potty SeatHint - just use nursing pads in the bottom of the bag to soak up the urine.
B0016KV73W My 2 year old Weighs about 30 lbs and can use this easily! Very portable and light weight! He has learned how to pee standing up thanks to his daddy so when we are in public restrooms, I find the lowest toilet seat then use this as a stepping stool for him and he can go. I'm holding on to him the entire time since his pants are down to his knees amd he can't balance well that way but it does the trick. We will be using this for the beach this summer!Another note, the storage bag that it comes in is plastic so I would recommend buying a medium wetbag (the type you use to put wet cloth diapers in) to use as a permanent storage in diaper bag instead.Great and sturdy!
B0016KV73W My 7 month old happily sits on this potty and does his business.  It fits nicely on any regular toilet making clean up a breeze - just flush!
B0016KV73W I bought this to potty train my daughter before she turned two. Because I was able to be consistent even when we were away from home, she was daytime potty trained in 3 weeks. We liked this so much that we keep one in the car at all times, ready to go, for those really inconvenient \"Potty-potty!\" calls on the road. We travel with this one also. Imagine a full restroom in Disneyland and not having to wait for a stall because you have this. If I had to wait for a stall, we would have had a mess to clean up. I just put down some paper towels on the ground in a corner of the restroom, pull out the Potette, let her sit on it to do her thing. There was some mommy-envy from moms in line for a stall. They asked me where I got it. My 21month old son is nearly daytime potty trained after two weeks. I must say that this is best for 18-24month olds because of its height. For boys especially, one has to be very careful to aim downward or a stream of urine could easily arch up & out.Buy this and you will not regret it when your little one is in big kid underwear and you can be fearless about getting to the potty \"in time\"!
B0016KV73W Once my son was potty trained in the house and we started to go on outings without pull-ups, I knew we were going to need to have an easy-access potty in the car  I actually traveled with the bijorn potty a few times (not a great idea.)  One day I saw a mom friend pull out a Potette for her daughter during a stroller workout at the park.  It was so compact and easy, I knew I had to get one.  So far it hasn't failed me (except the first time I used it without reading the instructions first and didn't \"click\" the legs in place and it collapsed as soon as my son sat on it.  Whoops...user error...)We've used this for long road trips, birthday parties hosted at parks where the bathrooms were far away or just plain filthy dirty, going on a hike, and at the beach.  It lives in our car, tucked in it's baggy, and behind a box of Kleenex.  I seriously don't know why anyone with young children wouldn't have one of these!***Seems like a lot of the negative reviews are from those who failed to lock the legs into the seat.  This takes a little finesse:  You need quite a bit of pressure to pop the legs in, and just the right amount of pressure to \"unlock\" and fold back in.  If you pull too hard, the legs just come detached. Best advice is to practice set-up and take-down a few times before needing to use it.***
B0016KV73W You can't beat the price for this Use-it-anywhere product!  Seriously... I am a first-time and one-time Mom to a beautiful little girl.  I also get squeamish/freaked-out with the thought of her using public bathrooms and the porta-john at the local park.  I'm not a full fledged germaphobe, but the thought of her sitting and holding onto these toilets is beyond gross!This product can be used as a potty seat over any toilet we've encountered AND... here's the best part:  this potty seat can also stand alone and be used as a portable potty chair with a fantastic bag-insert with a biodegradable gel pack to absorb urine.  I've used this for sudden announcements from the back seat declaring, &#34;I gotta make potty right now Mommy!&#34;  We pulled off the highway and found a safe spot to park the car (an office park with lots of trees and a few sparsely parked cars), I assembled the potty chair within seconds and Her Nibs was doing her &#34;business&#34; with comfort and a bit of pride (early in potty training).  We've used it as a stand alone, at the park, and the beach.  just set it up and sit her down... a little blanket or towel for privacy is a nice courtesy for everyone involved as well.  When she's finished we do a quick wipe, up with the pull-up, and I simply tie the bag handles in a knot and toss in the trash.  It's that easy.  I am now going to give this potty seat as a baby shower gift in the future (there are neutral colors).BOTTOM LINE:  Best value for the multiple-setting-use and money.  Super Easy to use.  Sturdy and Safe.  Portable:  fits in my back pack and diaper bag and comes with a plastic drawstring storage bag for hygienic storage.  A must-have item for parents and kiddos who are potty training and are on the go.
B0016KV73W I bought the Potette Plus (green seat with blue legs) at my local Babies R Us about 6 months ago.  At first, I didn't think it was that great.  My main complaint being the seat ring was far too big for a little hiney and my daughter's hiney kept falling INTO it.  Another reviewer made the comparison to it being like the rim of a toilet without the seat - fairly accurate description.  I just measured the hole and it's 6 inches wide by 7 inches long.  Compare that to the Fisher Price On the Go Potty (love that too) which has a hole measuring 4 1/2 inches wide by 6 inches long and it makes a huge difference.  I still believe the hole is much too big, especially since the potty is so low to the ground (only 4 inches tall in it's snapped together standing position!), making it a little hard for younger toddlers to position themselves correctly on it.  I am not sure how the kids in the product pictures are sitting on it with their legs out in front of them - my daughter has to straddle it.  I really believe the ring/seat of this potty could have been made a little smaller (even an inch all around would make a difference), and then it would be absolutely perfect and even easier to tote around.  So those are the only two negatives I have found with this seat.On to the good stuff.  It's small and when folded, can easily fit into a large purse or backpack, and it's lightweight enough to hang it (in a bag of some sort) over a stroller handle.  I used to keep the Fisher Price On the Go potty in my van, but now I only have this one in the van since it's so much smaller, lighter, and I can grab it and put it into a large purse for excursions.My daughter doesn't like to sit on the plastic bag that's supposed to go over the seat, so we had to figure out a way to make that work until she gets used to sitting on the plastic bag.  We cut down a 1 gallon ice cream pail so it would fit under the potty and we use the bags in the bucket, then put the potette over that.  Works great.  For now, I just keep the potty in it's standing position in the van and since it's small enough, it's no big deal.  I found that it fits in a drawstring backpack in it's standing position (even with the cut down bucket, lol), so we don't use the plastic carry bag it came with.  4 gallon trash bags work very well too.I've never used it as a toilet reducer, but I did just place it on both of my different toilet seats at home (one is molded wood, the other is plastic and picky when it comes to toilet reducers).  This seat clicks into flat position and is very sturdy.  There are little grippies on the inside of the legs to help it grab the toilet seat a little and it does help slightly.  Sturdy when on both toilet seats - even when pushed on by me.  On the molded wood seat, the potette fit very nicely, almost center on the toilet seat.  On the plastic seat, I had to push the potette back a little further for it to fit the best.  It would still wiggle a bit with a wiggly toddler.  I didn't buy it for this purpose though so I don't anticipate using it in this position, though it is nice to have the option.
B0016KV73W If you want to go anywhere for more than 30 minutes when potty training, you need something like this.  The things I didn't like about this particular device:  it is too low to the ground and the seat is small, the feet don't stay put unless you snap them in which isn't easy to do (my daughter tipped over twice before I realized how to do it), it requires buying refill bags, I'm not sure we're inserting the bags correctly, and it isn't clear which direction the kids should sit.  While small, it is too big for our older model Valco stroller basket so we have to hang it from the handlebar.  I may try another kind of travel potty, but until then we'll continue to take this on walks and in the car.  It gets the job done.
B0016KV73W We were somewhat nervous about how to go about a day with our toddler, as we are on the go quite a bit in busy New York City.This has made the transition to diaper free so easy, especially as I have a phobia of public toilets. I use it with regular plastic bags (the type you get at grocery stores) and it works well.  Folds easily, and we've used it both for travel and on the go. Well made.
B0016KV73W While potty training is one of the least enjoyable experiences of toddlerdom, this potty is a great addition to the process.  We purchased 3 different ones and she uses this one the most.  We use it at home on our regular toilet with a step stool and when we travel.  It's sturdy, light, and obvious portable and works really well.  Out little almost always chooses this one over the other two we have.
B0016KV73W **Edit. I lost it in a public bathroom and I'm more heartbroken than I should be. I loved this toilet. It made life easy. Mess free.I went and purchased some... crappy kushie folding toilet seat cover and... I hate it. It's nothing like this one.I know it's just a potty, but I really miss it.I think it only adds to my review that I miss this thing so much. It fit 99.9% of every toilet I ran into, minus one that it was a tad too big for.. but the rubber grips still held it on there.There isn't another potty out there like this one and the sooner I get a replacement [it's been two months. -sigh.-] The better.-SIIIGH.-**I didn't buy mine from Amazon because I was too cheap to pay shipping so I found mine on Craigslist instead. Why these parents didn't like this seat I have NO clue!! It's amazing. I bought 10 bags from an ebay seller for 9 bucks thinking I was buying the potty seat before I found it on Craigslist. Got an e-mail a few days later saying they'd accidentally sent me 90. Oh no, what is a girl to do? Now I have a ton of lined bags which is GREAT for when we're out. Parks, deserted parts of the mall if we're a long walk away from a bathroom. I just love it. I threaten my mum and my son's father about ever losing it and what I'll do to both of them if either of them leaves it somewhere. x3 so far they've been very careful.I would recommend this for any parent who's starting their child on the road to potty training young. The bonuses of this seat are;1. It folds up VERY small. Perfect for in the stroller or over night bag.2. It assembles very, very quickly. Even when getting the bag on which can be a bit loud/annoying to do depending on where you are or what time it is. [3am, I don't want to hear a crinkley bag and taking my son to the regular toilet wakes him up too much. I'll be buying a potty special for my bedroom quickly. One that doesn't depend on bags to be a free standing potty]3. Great for younger children just starting to potty train. The hole itself iiiis a bit small, I admit. Nothing to little for my 1.5 year old. I started him on the potty at 14 months and found I was never making it to the bathroom in time when we were out. This has helped me calm down and know that even if I can't find a bathroom I can pull this baby out, pop a bag in and not need to worry about changing a diaper.=D \"this is definately a buy.\" - Fruit Gushers review kid.
B0016KV73W This thing is AMAZING. We literally use it every day when we are out. we use it at restaurants, parks, the back of my car.. EVERYWHERE. Highly recommend.
B0016KV73W We have only had this little potty for a short while, and it has been a lifesaver, and so easy to use. You DO have to push the legs up into the seat until it clicks when you have it in \"seat\" position, not seat-topper position, to get it to be sturdy. There are no instructions on the package, so other reviews are the only reason I know this. Once set up, it is very stable, although short. But the shortness is what makes it so compact and easy to travel with, which is just fine with me. Of course, the ring is small, but I have a 2 year old the size of a three year old and she fits great. The vinyl bag it comes in it very handy to keep it contained when not in use. Some people have said they throw in in their purse, but it really is way too big to fit in a normal-sized diaper bag if you want anything else to fit in there. The vinyl bag is large enough to leave extra bags and wipes in there. The potty fits regular sized grocery sacks, so you can just put one of those on with a paper towel in the bottom and save a ton of money on the overpriced refills. I love this little potty- don't hesitate to buy it if you are on the fence about it!!
B0016KZZG2 After months of dry carpet and adventures in the car, I am finally able to rate this product.  It fits our Nestl&eacute; waters and other bottles along the way.  My rough and tumble boy has only stepped on it once to squirt the water, and in all other cases it has not leaked and gave me peace of mind not using the water fountain. No more water logged shirts and scrambles for a clean cup while in public.  I really like this product.  Please note your child will make teeth marks on the nozzle.  My only complaint is that there are 2 nozzles but only one top (as the picture shows).  Why not provide a top for each nozzle?  We make it work though, and it was still worth it.
B0016KZZG2 This item works great, doesn't leak, semi-hard-to-clean, but still ok. The only real problem I have with this is not the product itself, its the fact that my son LOVES to squeeze the water bottle so the water spouts out way up in the air and then all over everything. If your child doesn't do that, I'd say yes, buy it. But beware the squeezer!! Not a good fit with that one! :)
B0016KZZG2 I bought these spouts based on great reviews but got extremely disappointed when I start using them. They leak badly may be because a lot of water bottles were changed for the past year or so. I wish I got other toppers instead.
B0016KZZG2 We purchased this spout for our 2 year old and are wishing we would have purchased it earlier.Pros:- Non leak spout- 2 year old can use it easilyCons:- larger than expected, but doesn't harm its effectiveness.
B0016KZZG2 Works as described!  And it does create a kind of vacuum so the bottle will collapse as you drink, but still-- just pop the cap off and back on again and that solves that problem.
B0016KZZG2 This is a good spill proof top as long as the one using it doesn't squeeze the bottle. It does leak if the bottle is squeezed. I wouldn't recommend for use with anything but water, because water doesn't stain.
B0016KZZG2 Air gets trapped and the bottle caves in. Would not recommend these. Good concept but doesn't really work well.  Waste of money.
B0016KZZG2 These are great for babies and toddlers. My twins love water. So I send them to preschool with mini water bottles & these lids. (plus my one year old can use them too) The teachers send them home with the twins at the end of the day. All my friends love them when they come to visit because their kids won't make a mess in the house when running around with their drink. I would suggest it to anyone.
B0016LVB4Q So worth the buy - super soft, great quality and washes well... get two so you always have one on hand! Again 'Carters rocks'!
B0016LVB4Q Nothing wrong with the product itself, but after purchasing and using for a couple weeks with my newborn, I realized that changing pad covers are NOT worth the trouble (and someone please tell me why I thought brown would be an appropriate color... It hides the poo?). After throwing one away because it simply wasn't salvageable, the second one was neatly folded in a closet where, 10 months later, it remains.
B0016LVB4Q Durable cover--it's held up well with multiple washings so far (3 months) and stains come out well (using Bac-Out and sometimes OxiClean). Currently using it over an IKEA blow-up changing pad, so it's a generous fit; but it fits our other change pad. The cute \"bumps\" on the fabric are going away on the area that gets the most wear--the side where my baby's bottom/back lay while changing--which is disappointing. Doesn't look as nice now, so I give it only 4 stars.
B0016LVB4Q So So So SOFT!!! Love this item so much, i purchased another one! Great quality and my little boy seems to like the softness.
B0016LVB4Q I absolutely love this changing pad cover. It is very, very soft and fit very well and brown is a really good choice for obvious reasons :) It is really cozy and comfortable. I would recommend getting two (in brown) so that you always have one ready while the other is being washed. Definitely worth the money.
B0016LVB4Q I really like this changing pad cover. its very soft and is easy to get on and off the changing pad. only problem is that sometimes while changing my daughter she likes to pee and this doesn't absorb any moisture and it runs off onto the floor.
B0016LVB4Q I bought this for my son's changing pad.  We had some ugly yellow ones we got at a consignment sale so I was ready to get something that went with his decor a little bit more.This is perfect!  It washes up soft and didn't come apart.  The bumps give texture for him to feel while I am changing him.  You really can't go wrong with this cover!
B0016LVB4Q I love how soft this is! The color is great, the bumps really aren't a problem and it is easy to put on and take off.
B0016LVB4Q I love these covers so much that I bought 3 of them - they will get spit up on and peed on so be sure to have at least 1 extra to put on when the other is being washed. I got 3 for this purpose. They are SO soft and add a great touch of texture and color to the room.
B0016LVB4Q So there's really not a lot to say about this pad cover. It's very soft and seems to be well made. We've washed it a couple times now and it's holding up well.I guess the only thing I worry about is that it's a really nice cover for a place we're changing diapers. While we've only had one accident on it so far it does seem likely to get ruined pretty easily and quickly. Especially since our daughter loves to squirm while having her diaper changed and the pad belt doesn't really do the trick when it comes to holding her still. It just keeps her from sitting up.To top it off when we took the cover off to wash it she really didn't seem to notice the difference, which made me think that the cover is more of a novelty than a necessity.I will say that it is really soft and snuggly. If she notices the difference at all (or cares) then it is a nice cover.My wife did point out that without the cover when she did have her accident the changing pad is water resistant so it would've gone everywhere and run off the pad. But since the cover soaked it up... disaster averted.That said I think it was a pretty good buy but I think a regular cotton cover would've been just as effective.As I mentioned, it's a bit over the top but it is nice.UPDATESo it's been awhile since we got this and as I mentioned my biggest concern was it getting ruined.Well it's still in great condition. It's been drawn on with some markers and we've had some accidents, it's been washed more times than I can count and it is still soft and white.We use charlies soap which is pretty gentle on clothes to begin with so that may be part of it but I have to admit I'm pretty impressed with the cover.It's comfortable and durable. The same can be said for most all the Carters brand stuff we've bought for my daughter.
B0016LVB4Q love this changing pad cover. decided to buy the carters brand after purchasing a major retail store brand cover, which was not soft at all. carters is the best for all things baby. love it, baby loves it too. its not rough on her skin, for when she rolls to the side as i change her. i would def. recommend , and would guy again.
B0016LVB4Q We've been using this pad (in Ecru) for nearly a year and it's held up really well. It's soft and the ecru is a nice color that seems to wash pretty well. I always keep it covered with one of theseCarters Keep Me Dry Flannel Bassinet Pad, Ecrupads on top of it. Makes messes very easy to clean up. I also got a similar BOPPY cover in sage. I prefer the Carter's Ecru one though.
B0016LVB4Q This is the best diaper changing cover.  They wash up great as well.  I actually use them over the mini co-sleeper as well - they fit it perfectly.
B0016LVB4Q Changing pad cover is great.  We have 2 so we can wash one and have one on the changing pad.
B0016LVB4Q Love the softness of this cover. Nothing much else to say since it's all in the description, but I'd definitely buy again. And of course I'd buy at amazon a million times over babies-r-us; they are such a rip off. Free shipping with prime and no tax with amazon, you can't beat that!Also, fits mySimmons Kids Contour Dressing Table Pad with Non-Skid Bottomand any other standard changing pad. Just don't buy that changing pad for the non-skid (because there is no non skid!!!!)
B0016LVB4Q I love how soft this changing pad is!  It also holds up well to multiple washings and dryings.  It's very pretty addition to my nursery.
B0016LVB4Q Love the mute color and dots! Super soft and it is going to look great with my crib bedding, neutral and pristine.
B0016LVB4Q The green color is very pretty. Sort of a silvery green. Gender neutral.  The material is soft and silky.  I Love it!! Have washed it 3-4 times with no issues at all. Fits both of my changing pads (standard ones) perfectly.  If it were a bit less expensive I'd buy 5 of them in all different colors!
B0016LVB4Q This fits well over the Summer Infant Contoured Changing Pad that we ordered, and is really nice and soft without being too plush. I haven't washed it a lot, but seems like the quality will hold up through multiple washings. The color was a nice neutral, not too pink or yellow as some Ecrus tend to get. Good product for the price.
B0016LVB4Q We have this in fuschia too.  It's so soft, really nice to put your baby on.  The chocolate is a deep, rich color which has not faded with washing (I was this in cold with our dark clothes).  It looks nice and serves its function.  I'd love one in lime green, Carter's {:-)
B0016LVB4Q So soft and fits the changing pad well, even has cut outs for the changing pad straps. Only wish I would have got more than one.
B0016LVB4Q This changing pad cover is super soft and super cute! I washed the pad cover and kept its softness and fits my chaning pad cover great. I love the light pink color. I would def. order more covers from Carters.
B0016LVB4Q Another quality product from Carter's. These hold up well in the wash, and are super soft. They fit all standard changing pads very well. I would also suggest using a changing pad liner over this cover - so if your baby has a blow-out you are cleaning up, you don't have to change this cover every time!
B0016LVB4Q This changing pad cover is super soft and washes really well.  We have three of these and wash them all the time and after 9 months they still look new and actually seem even softer (and they were soft to begin with).  We have it in off white.
B0016LVB4Q This is the best changing pad ever. It is super soft and durable. Easy to wash and holds up great. Haven't had any problems with it so far.
B0016LVB4Q great quality, great color.  no complaints on this one!  I like the velour type covers for changing table over other stuff.
B0016LVB4Q I really like this changing pad cover; it fits perfectly and snugly, it looks nice, and it is really, really soft (and it's brown, so it does hide stains.  Unfortunately, I would also say that this is one of the least useful baby-related purchases I made - I never use it.  I did use it at first, but it got pooped and peed on constantly and I quickly realized that it was stupid to cover up the plastic, wipe-able changing pad with something I needed to wash every time.
B0016LVB4Q This fit our summer infant changing pad. Very soft cover and easy to put on and take off. Looks sharp in our nursery with the soft dots.
B0016LVB4Q This showed up exactly as I expected and as pictured.  It is soft and durable.  I would definitely reccomend this item to other moms.
B0016LVB4Q Very happy with the cover! It looks great in the room and it is just so darn soft!
B0016LVB4Q This changing pad cover is soft, durable, and fits the changing pad great! If it's anything like Carter's sheets, it's going to hold up for a LONG time as well! Great product. Very happy!
B0016LVB4Q I have no complaints about this cover. It fits well and is soft. There is really nothing special about it. I might like it better if it didn't get soaked so easily.
B0016LVB4Q Its great, baby loves it, contoured sides give secure feeling to squirmy baby. Fits LA Baby 4 sided changing pad 32&#34;. I bought &#34;pink&#34; ;-)
B0016LVB4Q I am pleasantly suprised by this purchase.  The cover is very soft for the baby and (possibly more important) not cheesy looking like many others I've seen.  It blends right in with our decor.
B0016LVB4Q I agree with the other reviewers:  this is a superb cover in terms of softness, fit, quality, etc.  However, if you are on the fence about what kind of changing pad cover to get, hold off.  Ours spends more time in the washing machine because of spit up and other wonders of baby changing, so we end up using receiving blankets and cloth diapers over our changing pad a lot of the time.  If you have the money, get two.  If you would rather save some money, this is one of those items that you can scratch off of your list.  I love this particular cover, just not the impracticality of covers in general.
B0016LVB4Q Super SoftEasy to care forDoesn't shrinkNice Calm sage color (goes well in our nursery)Hasn't changed over time and I've washed mine enough timesI only bought one and it's been fine.
B0016LVB4Q I purchased this cover in Chocolate for a Serta changing pad. It is so soft, my baby loves to be put down on it. She gets all smiley and just loves the feeling. The elasticized edges fit the Serta pad perfectly. I decided to buy a back up cover in Sage and was very pleased at how the cover didn't stain. I was afraid with a lighter color that spit up and accidents might leave stains but my worries were unfounded. Great cover, I'll probably buy another soon!
B0016LVB4Q This changing pad cover is so ridiculously soft, I love it!!!  The chocolate color looks slightly washed out, but I love the way it feels!!!  I am definitely buying a couple more to keep on hand so that I will always have a clean one handy, but decided to go with the baby blue color.  I am thinking that my espresso colored baby furniture may have something to do with my not liking the chocolate color. . . it's all too dark.  I know baby will be so comfy during his diaper changes.  Also fits our infant summer contoured changing pad perfectly.  Couldn't be happier with this product.
B0016LVB4Q We couldn't ask for anything softer. This is an excellent changing pad cover and it holds up very well wash after wash.
B0016LVB4Q I have had these covers for over a year, and I still love them.Pros:They are soft.They match the jungle theme in my baby's nurseryThey do not show a single stain after over a year of useThey wash and dry very well. No pilling and still very soft.They are affordable.Cons:They are not organic.Overall, I am super pleased with this purchase and it is one of the few items I bought for the nursery I would buy again.
B0016LVB4Q This is the perfect changing pad cover. It washes well and is super soft for my babies skin. The cover does not fit too tight so it is easy to take off and put back on my changing pad. Plus the brown color matches my son's room perfectly. Would change nothing about this product.
B0016LVB4Q I bought this cover to use with the  Summer Infant Contoured Changing Pad, also purchased on Amazon.  I was very impressed with both products being decent value and high quality.  This is the softest material changing pad and is soo adorable to add to our nursery.  Glad I found this!
B0016LVB4Q This changing pad cover is super soft and cleans up well.  I recommend getting waterproof lap pads to put under baby's bottom otherwise you may be washing the cover more than you want (especially with newborns who will often continue their diaper destruction with the diaper off!).  We also have the Ecru and are pleased with both colors.  Would buy again.
B0016LVB4Q We have this changing pad cover in 3 colors. It is very soft, and holds up well in the wash: messes come out without special treatment, and after 3 months of being laundered several times a week is still as soft as the first day we used it. It fits our changing pad well, has elastic all the way around (not just the corners), and has slots for the changing pad's safety harness.
B0016LVB4Q I love this changing table cover, it is so soft and comfortable. It has been washed numerous times already and still looks great. It stretches perfectly to fit over the pad and stays snug enough to not move excessively. The color is great too since it doesn't show stains like light colors.
B0016LVB4Q This changing pad cover is so soft, I'm sure my baby will love snuggling into it.  Can't wait for him to use it.
B0016LVB4Q We purchased this to cover the Summer Infant changing pad. It fit perfectly, super soft, easy to wash and still in great shape a year and a half later.
B0016LVB4Q It is a perfect fit, just like people were saying in the other reviews. I actually ordered two so we have an extra.
B0016LVB4Q This changing pad cover is so soft and fits the changing pad perfectly!  I would definitely recommend this product.  I might order an extra one for when this one is being washed.
B0016LVB4Q I love the fabric and how soft it feels, just right for a baby. I haven't had my baby yet so I don't know how will it turn out to be after several washes, although my mom just washed it for the first use and nothing happened to the fabric yet. Hope its a good buy so that I can buy more of these things in future. I think amazon has the best price too, so thanks :)
B0016LVB4Q We used this to cover our summer infant bassinet pad, that we use in our Graco mini pack and play.  These sheets fit perfectly.  We also use them in rotation on our changed pad on the changing table.
B0016LVB4Q Love it! Super soft, looks great and fits changing pad perfectly! I washed it many times on hot/cold and the color seems to hold.
B0016LVB4Q Love these changing pad covers! I had one of these, and one of another brand. I liked this one so much, I went and bought a second, and discarded the other one I had. They're cute, soft, and have held up great so far. We have a contour pad with 3 raised sides, and they fit perfectly. My son is 10 months old, and we've used these covers since birth.
B0016LVB4Q I love the super soft fabric. We use this withLA Baby 4 Sided Changing Pad 32\", Whiteand it fits perfect!
B0016LVB4Q These changing pads are exactly as described.  They are super soft, and wick away moisture easily. I also like the ecru color as it blends easily with any decor.
B0016LVB4Q As it says this product is very soft.  Went on very easily and looks great in the nursery, happy with my purchase.
B0016LVB4Q We've used this cover 6 1/2 months.  So glad we spent the extra few dollars for this nicer-looking cover.  It's color looks like the picture, it's durable--have washed it half a dozen times.  We use a waterproof pad liner on top of it, but it seems it would hold up well regardless.  We have the Diaper Genie changing pad and its wide straps do not fit through the strap holes in this cover.  Also, the holes are so near the cover's edge that the holes are underneath the pad.  And the Diaper Genie straps come out the side of the pad.  So we just ended up not using the holes.  Eventually I'll get around to sewing a new hole where it should be for our pad.
B0016LVB4Q Love this cover...so I bought two more to keep on hand.  It is so soft and fits my pad nicely.  Highly recommend, especially ove regular cotton covers.
B0016LVB4Q This is so soft it is so nice for my baby. It is always warm which is great for the baby. Washes great, washed mine at least 10 times and still looks brand new. Love the color, doesnt show any stains inbetween washes.
B0016LVB4Q Nice changing pad, super soft!  Well, I can tell you with 100% accuracy that this washes very well and it is still super-soft even after all these washings.  Fits well on the changing pad and easy to put on/take off. Glad we have some of these!
B0016LVB4Q These are very soft and durable and fit my contoured changing pad perfectly (I thought all covers would, but that's not true - I bought another one from a big name store that did not work at all!). Unfortunately, I haven't used mine a great deal - my little one likes to mess all over the changing pad the minute we take her diaper off and I got tired of washing the covers all the time! Lol! But when she gets a little bigger and a little more predictable, they will definitely go back on...
B0016LVB4Q We love love this! super soft, easy to wash & come on brown is perfect. Bought 2 but I think I'm going to get a third
B0016LVB4Q This is a great changing pad cover. It's incredibly soft and washes really well. I have bought a lot of Carter's velour stuff and have been happy every time with it! Their velour crib sheets are also amazing.
B0016LVB4Q We are pleased with this product, though it is quite expensive, if I must say so. I think it's going to work out nicely with our changing pad. We got a large, 4-sided changing pad, and it fits pretty well. I mean, it doesn't hug it like a glove, but we are okay with that. It is going to provide the function that it was designed for quite nicely. I would probably not recommend this for smaller changing pads, as it may be too loose on them. I can see a baby grabbing on and pulling it right off in the middle of a changing, which might spell a messy disaster...
B0016LVB4Q This is sooo soft! And it's adorable, washable, and comfy. I highly recommend to anyone to buy this product. It is wonderful
B0016LVB4Q THe cover is soft, easy to clean and has lasted two years and is still going strong with baby number two!
B0016LVB4Q This is a must have (in any color) for a baby nursery.  These covers are soft and comfortable and they hold up to lots of washes!
B0016LVB4Q We own two of this changing pad cover in the \"chocolate\" color.  (My goal was to always have one clean, in case the other got dirty during a changing.)  They are incredibly soft.Despite dozens of washings, they look pretty much new.  No fading, no thinning of the material.Highly recommended.
B0016LVB4Q Super soft and cute!! Seems very durable and color is true to description. I was concerned about it not conforming to the changing pad I have as  it has raised edges but no issues.
B0016LVB4Q These changing pad covers are wonderful.  I currently have two changing pads,Summer Infant 4-Sided Changing PadandSummer Infant Contoured Changing Pad.  This cover fits both perfectly.Before I purchased these, my baby hated to have her diaper changed.  She never complained about having her diaper changed again after I started using the Carters' Super Soft Dot Changing Pad Cover.They are amazingly soft and have not been damaged by the washing machine (on gentle cycle) or the dryer.  I would recommend these changing pad covers to anyone.
B0016LVB4Q Love this, own it in a variety of colors. These are SO soft, look great in the nurery, and still look and feel wonderful after many washes. They fit my long changing pad quite nicely. You can find cheaper pads, but to me this is worth the price, I feel it is very comfortable for my baby and it's holding up nicely.
B0016LVB4Q This comes exactly as shown a bright brown and super soft to the touch. My 4 month old loves to run his hands along the &#34;bumps&#34; in the material!
B0016LVB4Q This changing pad cover fits securely and is very soft. Perfect for the babies room. Very delicate to the touch.
B0016LVB4Q This has held up well over the last year. Washed tons of times and still as soft and cute as ever!
B0016LVB4Q This changing pad cover is fantastic.  It is so soft and feels great to the touch while the raised dots give it just the right amount of texture.  Baby is sure to love it! The pink is a beautiful color that is sure to complement the decor of just about any girl's room.
B0016LVB4Q This cover is great. it is soft and plush. it goes great with the colors of our nursery. its chocolate color that you see in the picture is true to the color that it really is. you should always have 2 covers and i would order two of this cover in a heartbeat.
B0016LVB4Q We love this changing pad cover. We got 2. It is so plush and comfy for baby. Very soft and makes the room look nice. Looks much more expensive than others on the market. I have zero complaints and would absolutely buy this again. I've washed it over and over the last 5 months and no signs of wear.
B0016LVB4Q The pink cover was very close to the color pictured. I has remained baby soft even after repeated washing and air drying. I also purchased the same cover in off white at a local store and they both are holding up extremely well. Extremely pleased with this product!
B0016LVB4Q This changing pad cover is super soft and the size is perfect for fitting over a 16\" x 32\" pad.  Great to have an extra on hand for when one is being washed.
B0016LVB4Q i will not return because its a bit of a hassle, this looks nice its a very pale pink!the fabric feels a bit thin, not sure how long it will last...worth the money tho if u don't want to spend a whole lot
B0016LVB4Q Fits over my summer infant changing pad perfectly even after multiple washes & drys in hot.  It's very soft and the dots add a nice texture.  The brown is a rich deep color.  Looks great with my espresso crib!
B0016LVB4Q We have 3 of these in different colors/styles.  Like some other reviewers, we also use the keep-me-dry lap pads on top of the changing cover to catch accidents.  Have washed these many times and they still look great - very easy to care for and a reasonable price.  They are also super, super soft, which we love for our Little One.
B0016LVB4Q Doesn't soak through, cleans up well, still looks great & fits great even after a handfull of accidents and washes.  Plus it's cute.
B0016LVB4Q Very soft and comfy, better than others out there- buy several as tehy get dirty frequently! a must have for baby
B0016LVB4Q This changing cover is the perfect shade of pale pink for our nursery. I really didn't want anything too bright as we've used all pastel colors. It seems very soft and fits our old changing pad from pottery barn kids. Will be ordering a couple more to have back ups.
B0016LVB4Q My daughter really likes this changing cover. It is soft and warm for her many diaper changes. It washes nicely and doesn't require any special instructions. I think I am going to get it in another color too.
B0016LVB4Q I had hoped that this cover would be nice, and I am not let down. Very soft, and it fits the changing pad mattress perfectly. Thank you!Edit: I ordered the Graco Travel Lite Crib (more like a cross between a small pack n play & bassinet though) for our baby & someone suggested using this Super Soft Dot Cover to cover the Summer Infant Bassinet Pad that I got to go inside it. I was not let down! It not only fits the pad perfectly, it is so super soft against baby's skin too! I love it so much that I ordered another one to switch them out when one is being washed. I now own the chocolate, ecru, and sage colored ones, and am contemplating getting the pink one too. These are so perfect for both changing table pad cover & bassinet pad cover alike!!!!! All of the above mentioned can be found here on Amazon.
B0016LVB4Q My baby loves laying on his changing pad, even when not being changed because this is so soft and comfy! It fits our changing pad just right (elastic around the whole bottom). The color is nice and neutral, but just make sure to wash it with like colors or it will slightly change colors.
B0016LVB4Q I love the \"minky\" fabric that this changing cover is made with. It is super soft, a great soft pink color, and it washes well. I even put it in the dryer and it didn't shrink or change the fabric at all. Very nice cover for the price.
B0016LVB4Q We have 1 sage & 1 pink cover that we've been using for a little over 13 months and they are still in PERFECT condition.We have twin girls which means twice the diaper changes which means twice the chance of these getting soiled & needing washed. Especially when they were newborns they liked to pee all over once we got their diapers off. These have been washed a TON of times, both on delicate & regular cycle & then on regular in the dryer and they show no signs of wear, still look like new, still have the raised dots and are still super soft! They also slip easily over our changing pad.If you have twins or more, I definately recommend getting at least 2 of these, maybe more. Also, you can get the mini water resistant pads(quite a few) and put that under babys bottom when you change them...then if they pee or if they're being really honery and poo, you just have to change the soiled pad & not this cover. You can also buy the water resistant pads meant for a crib and cut them small enough to use for the changing pad.
B0016LVB4Q Soft.  Nice color.  Fits great.  The dots are dots.  Nothing special about them.  What else can I say, it works.
B0016LVB4Q All of my Carter's textiles have done the same exact thing within a year's time.  The elastic gives out.  This changing pad cover does not even have the slightest bit of stretch left, so I have to tuck it under the pad, and it comes off all the time.  I do not wash them abnormally frequently--only when very soiled, with is not often.  I think it averages out to washing each cover once every 6 weeks.I really cannot understand how this gets a 5-star rating.  I would give it 0 stars if I could.  And since I have multiple other Carter bedding items and they have all done the same thing, I know I don't have a \"fluke.\"  My other branded textiles have not done this, as they are still stretchy after 3 years of continual use.Invest in higher quality if you need it to last over a year.  I know this is the only negative review so far, but please know that I am being as honest and accurate as I can.
B0016LVB4Q Love it!  This changing pad cover is so soft and plush feeling.  I have had this for several months now and it has not shrunk and still looks new.  I have espresso finish for the crib set in my babies room and this matches with the furniture so well.  Highly recommend!
B0016LVB4Q Nice color, soft sheets, appears to be a quality product. However, took forever to receive. Got these to match Carson's chocolate velour crib sheets, and its a perfect match.
B0016LVB4Q True color (it's a pale sage green).  Very soft and fit the standard changing pad perfect.  We are very happy with the purchase.
B0016LVB4Q This is a soft cover and I love the texture. It washes well and I dryed on low to avoid shrinkage.
B0016LVB4Q This changing pad cover is super soft!  It's comfortable for the baby and is nice looking.  This pad holds up extremely well in the washing machine.  The material seems to be of high quality and like it will last for some time.  I will say if you get some stains on it get to them quickly because they will set into this pad.
B0016LVB4Q Very soft and fits my changing pad perfectly.  This changing pad also washes well without shrinkage or pilling of fabric.
B0016LVB4Q I bought this to match the crib bumpers. Just like the bumper the fabric is super soft. I do not have a contoured changing pad but rather a flat one and this fits perfectly.
B0016LVB4Q I love these!  I bought two (one for the changing station, and one for her bassinet) They're soft and easy to wash.
B0016LVB4Q Great changing pad cover. It is super soft, easy to wash, pretty, and durable. There is nothing more you can really want from a cover. It has holdes for the straps, which we don't use, but they are there if you need them.My baby loves the texture on them and likes to run her hands over the little soft bumps as I change her. Good to have something else distract her so I have an extra few seconds for the diapers change.Most importantly, it has lasted many many many washes.There are plenty of colors. We have sage and pink and like them both (good tones, not too bright, match with everything we have).
B0016LVB4Q Pros:-Soft... in fact, still as soft as the day we opened it and it has been through the washer/dryer 8 times now!-It does not hold a stain! We bought this in the Ecru, and it has been covered in bright yellow baby poop about 4 times now, and each time it comes out of the washer as clean and stain-less as can be! I was sure we ruined it after the first \"explosive baby poop\" fiasco, but it does not have a SINGLE stain on it.-It still looks brand new and like I said, it has been through the wash 8 times! Normally fuzzy fabrics like this don't hold up in the washer/dryer.
B0016LVB4Q Really like this pad cover for the following reasons:- it's soft and baby likes it- it's easy to wash- lasted for 3+ yrs and 2 kids and it looks/feels exactly the same; also does not shrinkgood buy.
B0016LVB4Q It fits the changing pad well, has slits for the safety straps, and cleans up easily in the washing machine.  No weird smells or itchy bits.
B0016LVB4Q Love the feel of this. Much better than the rough terry fabric seen on most changing pad covers. My baby notices the difference.
B0016LVB4Q this is so soft and they make crib sheets in the same fabric and its so soft. best cover i've found yet.
B0016LVB4Q I love this changing pad it's sooooo soft and comfy. My baby is very comfortable resting when I'm changing her diaper. Would recommend this product especially for winter. I order several because they can be used as bassinet sheets!!!!
B0016LVB4Q Love love love this! I need to buy more so when I wash this one I have another to replace it (hello blowouts). So soft be my baby loves laying on her changer. If I left her there all day I'm sure she'd love it. Ha!
B0016LVB4Q I really like this cover, wish I could buy sheets for the crib just as this one. It looks and feels great.
B0016LVB4Q The fabric is very soft, and I haven't had a problem getting stains out of it. I had bought a rather large changing pad and was afraid this wouldn't fit, but in fact it fits quite well. The photo of the sage color is a little misleading; I would describe it as more of a forest-y green.
B0016LVB4Q These are so wonderfully soft and easy to put on and take off because lord knows you will wash it elevnty billion times before its all said and done.  We liked it so much we bought the same one when we bought another diaper change station.
B0016LVB4Q This cover has worked really well on our changing pad. It's ultra soft (our cat likes to use it as a napping spot) and it soaks up leaks quickly without letting them get all over everything. It also has held up well so far to our washing machine (we've used it for about a month). Plus, the chocolate color is great and the raised dots are cute. It goes on and off our changing pad with ease, and stays on well. I recommend having two pad covers so that you can wash one cover and still have another one to use.
B0016LVB4Q The fabric color and texture is great. Fits my changing table pad perfectly and is easy to remove to clean!
B0016LVB4Q This cover is just what I was looking for, attractive and soft. I would have given it 5 stars, but I have not had it very long and I have no idea how durable it is. So far, so good!
B0016LVB4Q this is not only soft and beautiful but it washes well and holds up well over time.  My baby is now 6 months old and the covers all still look brand new after 6 months of washing and drying
B0016LVB4Q For my first son I only used the terrycloth covers, but decided to try this out for my second son: I love them!  They looks nice after being washed (on hot) and after going through the dryer (on medium heat) and they fit my 4-sided changing pad very well.  Will buy more of these for sure!
B0016LVB4Q This changing pad is super soft but it stained so easily! Every time it got a little bit of diaper cream on it, the spot of diaper cream turned gray in the wash. After a few months it looked so terrible that I threw it out. I bought a yellow one and the same thing happened. My son is 10 months old and very squirmy so it's nearly impossible to prevent diaper cream from getting on the changing pad. I have 2 terry cloth changing pad covers (1 white, 1 blue) that do not get the same gray stains. I definitely recommend terry cloth over this material.ProsGood Size And FitNice PatternSoftConsStains Easily
B0016LVB4Q I did not think I was going to like this and only bought it because it was recommended to go with the changing pad I bought. But I was pleasantly surprised at how soft it is. Looks good and feels well made. Have not washed it as yet but I hope the color does not fade.
B0016LVB4Q I love these- soft, well made, pretty sage color.  I bought two with our first child.  Bought a third with our second.  Two would probably do, as I use the changing table less- and the living room floor more!  But, don't mind, as these are great.  Durable, too, with all the washing, and will be able to pass long to my sister when she has kids.
B0016LVB4Q I own three of these since I'm constantly changing them out. They're very soft and fit my changing pad great. I wish that they had a better selection of colors though.
B0016LVB4Q Easy to wash, and super fluffy. Our 2 month old loves it! I would strongly recommend to anyone in search of a new changing pad cover.
B0016LVB4Q Super soft and has a nice snug fit over the changing pad. If this is your first child, make sure you have three changing pad covers. We started with two, but I quickly found that three made things easier and I didn't feel like I was always having to do a load of laundry because the changing pad covers were dirty.
B0016LVB4Q This changing pad cover is SUPER soft and fits perfectly on my changing pad (Summer Infant Contoured Changing Pad). It even has slits so the buckles can come through. I've used it for a year and washed several times and have had no problems. This is a great quality pad.
B0016LVB4Q I was mostly worried about this shedding in the wash. So far, it has held up amazingly well, even washing in hot water with diapers. When I worked in a daycare, we just used a bare changing pad, and wiped down after every change. While that works in an institutional setting, I wanted something a little cozier for my own baby. This is super soft and works in cold and warm temperature to keep baby comfortable on the changing pad. We do a lot on our changing table besides just diaper changes. Giving vitamins, cleaning ears and nose, washing hands and face, singing songs, learning about body parts, even baby massage. The changing table is a bonding place for me and my baby. So it's worth it to me to have such a nice surface for baby to lay on. On the practical side, it does a decent job of repelling minor &#34;spills&#34; so in the event of an accident, I can get baby off the table and pull the cover off before anything undesirable soaks through to the pad, giving me a bigger mess to clean up. The cover goes right in the laundry, a quick wipedown of the pad, and I'm ready to put a new cover on. In fact, I bought two, so my changing pad never goes &#34;naked&#34; while one is in the wash.
B0016LVB4Q I love this changing pad cover. It's soft and cozy so my daughter doesn't mind lying on it while I change her. It's easy to wash and has held up nicely for me so far.
B0016LVB4Q This is such a soft changing pad cover. I love minky anything and this is no different. It matches the nursery decor perfectly
B0016LVB4Q This was a great product at a great price. I like how it is less bulky than the fleece ones sold at Target so it is easy to store. It is soft and has held up well in the 7 months we've used it.
B0016LVB4Q This is a very nice changing pad cover. It's soft, pretty colored, and thick and luxurious feeling. My only word of advice is to check out the harder-to-find on Amazon Carter's giraffe printed one before buying this one. We got both to have a spare, but really only needed one. The giraffe one is truly awesome.
B0016LVB4Q You cannot go wrong with this brand, the texture is soft, the color is perfect for a little girls room and fits all standard changing pads.
B0016LVB4Q I love this cover!  It adds some softness and warmth to the cold, plastic and waterproof changing pad.  I've washed it many times over the last year and it has held up well.  I love the little slits in the side to thread the safety belt through!  I didn't notice those until a few months ago and thought I'd mention it in case others hadn't noticed either!
B0016LVB4Q The material on this changing pad is SOFT. We've only been using it for a short time but it gets washed frequently. There has been no degradation after all the times it's been through the washer and dryer. I'd highly recommend this over a generic brand, it'll last.
B0016M10C8 I got these so my son wouldn't have his bare back on the cold plastic changing pad when we change him. My changing pad doesn't have a belt, so the slits are useless to me but they don't bother me or get in the way. These are nice and they wash well. We always have one on the pad and if he wets through it then we can quickly swap it out for the second one while the first is washing. I like these much better than the plastic thin Boppy brand ones I got at my baby shower.
B0016M10C8 I washed the changing pad covers according to the directions, and they turned rough and fuzzy.  REALLY fuzzy on the back of it, and kind of fuzzy on the top.  It is also impossible to get poop stains out of it...and with a new baby, poop will be everywhere!  We have just started to lay a hand towel down on the changing table.  It is bigger than these crummy pads and stains come out much better!
B0016M10C8 These pads are of great quality. I gave it 4 stars because its not what i thought it was. i was looking for changing pads only, not changing table pads. I want to put them in my diaper bag to use when we're out and i need to change the  baby. I don't want to use them on the changing table, which is what its intended for.  I will keep them because they are really nice and thick and soft and i can still use them in my diaper bag.
B0016M10C8 These are awful. They do not stay put. They are too small to cover vinyl completely. Should have some sort of slidproofing on back.
B0016M10C8 I thought these changing pad covers would fit the entire changing pad... but they only cover the flat middle part (on our Graco pack'n play it's the part that is tan in the middle) which is ok, but our little guy is getting bigger and bigger everyday and his entire body doesn't even fit on it (he is only 3 months old). I like using the pad covers because they keep him from laying on the cold changing pad, but with these his feet still hang off. He hasn't seemed to mind, so I give the product a 4 instead of something lower, but I was a little dissapointed that they didn't cover the entire changer!
B0016M10C8 I knew before purchasing this item that it was small. I knew that it would only cover the bottom of the pack n play changing pad to offer protection from the hard cold plastic. I have not used them yet as they were a shower gift, but they have washed well and will fit perfectly in the bottom of the changing pad and provide protection which is all I need it to do. My friends who own these say they hold up well and are a must buy.
B0016N3SF4 My daughter loves this in the bath with her.  They are very cute and a fun toy that we also gave as a gift and that child loved as well.
B0016N3SF4 I like this bath set, it was a cute change from yellow ducks. drawback is the plastic rings deflated days later, but the frogs are durable
B0016N3SF4 My son is still too young to play with these but I love them at bathtime.  I use them to distract him (2.5 mo old) while his dad washes him down.  Not sure how long these will keep his attention but they're so cute.  I was concerned about how long the air would last in the rings but after 1 mo in the tub they are still filled and buoyant.
B0016N3SF4 super cute and just love the floaties.  great price, made a perfect baby shower gift, gender neutral makes it an easy pick
B0016N3SF4 I play with it as much as a baby does. Very nicely done. Idea of floating rings with frogs on them is just unbelievable. Would recommend for any age.
B0016N3SF4 We used this as a diaper cake topper for my sisters baby shower. Her theme obviously rubber duckies. Perfect decor and baby bath toy after. Very happy.
B0016N3SF4 Looks very elegant. The classic rubber duck!  Baby loves it and it just beautifies he bath. Good material - seems durable. Lovely colors.
B0016N3SF4 From the moment I saw these froggies on my friends baby's pictures I fell in love with them. I ordered this toy, and loved it even more after seeing it in person. My 9 months old daughter loves to play with baby frogs, and to chew on the floaties. She even snuck one of the floaties to her crib a couple of times. A very cute, well-made, functional toy.
B0016N7IJ6 I am a huge fan of these placemats.  They are not smelly and plasticky and do the job.  They seem to hold up well with lots of food smeared all over them.  I would love the stickem to be a bit more tacky but we make it work.  They are also biodegradeable and affordable.
B0013OX9NC I can't give this 5 stars yet. I'm waiting to see if I can SEE the four stars without the benefit of my glasses and hopefully, these Lutein supplements will help me do so.I like that they're easy to swallow and don't \"come back up.\"  Lutein is a great way to guard against macular degeneration so I'm looking forward (literally) to seeing the results.I will update this review soon to share the results.
B0013OX9NC Lutein is a chemical found in healthy eyes. There is some evidence that adding a lutein supplement to your diet will protect your vision and perhaps improve it. Some reviewers here claim better vision. So far I can't claim that my vision has improved (but I have only been taking Lutein for about a week). The single-compound food supplement market has been growing over the last few years. Chronditin and other joint-preserving compounds have attracted serious fans. In this case, Lutein is definitely needed (as evidenced that it is found in the retina)by the eye. What isn't clear (yet) is whether or not ingesting Lutein actually makes it from the digestive system to the retina.It comes down to personal preference. For the relatively low price of this supplement, I think it is worth investing in something that appears to be helping people maintain and improve their vision. Are they really helped or just enjoying the placebo effect? I don't know. Jarrow is a reputable brand and I trust that I am getting the indicated dosage. I figure it's worth $12 (approx.) a month to try to insure eye health. If you are also inclined to try Lutein, then this product is a very good choice; the dosage is within the range that eye professionals suggest, the company has a good reputation, and the price is reasonable.I'll report back if/when I feel any direct benefits. For now, I have added it to my daily supplements.One Month ReportNo detectable changes in vision. I am going to continue using this for another 3 months. If I can't find any noticeable changes/improvements, I will discontinue. Stay tuned....
B0013OX9NC My son reviewed this product since he has a retinal/visual impairment.  The product was palatable, and easy to take as directed.  He was unable to notice any difference after three weeks in visual acuity or color differentiation.  As with many supplements and even conventional medication, it is difficult to ascertain an alteration in your body's status without objective forms of measurement before and after.It would be ideal to not only trial this product for a minimum of 3 months, but to also be able to perform visual acuity and color perception assessments along the way.
B0013OX9NC Carotenoids are a family of plant pigments found in fruits and vegetables. They are red in color, but some appear pink or yellow.Salmon, lobster, and shrimp contain the carotenoid called astaxanthin. Carotenoids are powerful anti-aging antioxidants, which protect human body cells from free radicals, which disturb the body's molecular structure. Vitamin C, vitamin E, and lipoic acid are network antioxidants.Jarrow Formulas Lutein( in 60 softgels) contains these revolutionary ingredients that will protect your health(and fight body aging). Lutein and zeaxanthin are found in dark, green, leafy vegatables. And in this little bottle. The average American absorbs about 2 mg of lutein per day. Don't be average. Kick up your health trajectory. Jarrow Formulas.
B0013OX9NC The Jarrow name is the reason I ordered this product.  I always know that Jarrow ships only the best and I was not disappointed.
B0013OX9NC I have an aunt with macular degeneration and she was advised to take Lutein so I decided to try this brand which has been around since 1977. Before I buy from a company I always checkout who owns it. So many of the companies these days have been bought by mega corporations. It seems that Jarrow, though incorporated in 1988 is still run by Jarrow L. Rogovin from their base in Los Angeles. Other than that, the company has a message on the bottom of its page that says it supports US/Isreal relations. The Lutein comes in the form of a medium sized orange football shaped softgel which is easy to swallow. I've taken Lutein for some time so I can't attest to this brand being better or worse than others. It contains 20mg of Leutin from Marigold Petal Extract and 1mg of Zeaxanthin from the same source.
B0013OX9NC Supposedly lutein is great for your eyes and is found in eggs.  So if you have cholesterol issues or egg allergies, this is an option.  They are easy to swallow and no noticeable after taste or smell.But I cannot measure if it's working or not (can't do that with eggs either).  So if you need lutein, this is an option.
B0013OX9NC I haven't noticed any improvement in vision thus far.  Also, I have a cataract in my left eye and no improvement there either, and there have been suggestions that Lutein can improve the vision and/or slow the progression of cataracts.Despite this, I know that Jarrow makes an excellent product and the price seems very reasonable.  4 stars based on that.  Should I begin to notice improvement in any way, I'll update this review and share my findings with anyone who might be interested.
B0013OX9NC In my opinion, Jarrow makes the most high quality supplements.  Their Lutein is no different.  Lutein was recommended to me improve my vision, particularly night vision.  I believe this supplement helps with vision and keeps eyes healthy.  This supplement helps prevent macula degeneration and also helps with focus and color differentiation.  Highly recommended.  Excellent product.
B0013OX9NC I have a dry eye problem at night and thought I would try this (as a Vine Reviewer). I've been taking it for a couple weeks, but I haven't notice any difference. I had been using Fish OilNew Chapter Wholemega, 1000 Mg, 180-Countthat my Optometrist recommended, so I will probably go back to that regime along with this stuff.After doing some research on-line, I discovered that the ingredients in this product (Lutein and Zeaxanthin) are compounds called Xanthophylls, which are naturally-occuring yellow pigments (from Marigolds) and are anti-oxidants. Xanthophylls belong to a class of organic compounds called carotenoids. These compounds might reduce your risk for macular degeneration and cataracts. I am concerned about my eye health especially since I work on a computer and do close-up work throughout the day.The dosage is one and it is a very small soft-gel and easy to swallow.
B0013OX9NC My son has recurring anterior uveitis.  Which I have tried to control as holistically as possible.  He takes circumin and quercitin everyday as antiinflammatory compounds. To protect the eye, they suggest carotenoids found in leafy greens.  Well, that goes only so far...it is always a battle.  So we have been supplementing with this pill that helps protect the eye and gives him the carotenoids that I obsess about him getting.His eye has been clear, with the exception of one short flare up, for almost two years.  Yay!  The original diagnosis was pretty grim and a lifetime on crappy steroids scared me for him on so many levels.  I am happy to be controlling it this way.
B0013OX9NC I have been taking this supplement for about a month. I have noticed that my eyes feel stronger and more powerful. I am also supplementing with Beta Carotene. I plan to order more of this &#34;LUTEIN&#34; supplement when this finishes. It appears to me that it is a very effective product!!!
B0013OX9NC I began taking Lutein when I became concerned about my genes...I've never had great ideas but watching my mother slowly and permanently lose her vision is scary and heartbreaking. But that's not to say only those who see their parents in this position need it: After all, my grandparents (my mom's parents) never even needed GLASSES!Simply put, this is insurance for one's eyes, especially in this time when we we are making them do far more work than generations ever before in front of glaring computer screens, e-readers, and far more TV daily.  Who knows what ill effects our generations may see that we have no idea about now as we are the first to enter the digital age?While it's hard to say the improvements on our eyes from a few months of lutein, it does appear that the Jarrow formula has a good quantity and is in pure form, and a good supplement that many doctors say we really should be taking but it's not always found in supplements. (icaps supplements add lutein because of the movement saying we all need it now.)If your vitamin supplement doesn't yet contain lutein, don't forget one of your most important organs as you nourish the rest. I was blind for a year after lasik surgery went wrong, and I can personally tell you living without your eyes is noplace you EVER want to be.  it's affordable insurance against a common issue: eye degeneration.
B0013OX9NC Jarrow's Lutein 20mg I have not noticed anything positive or negative. I am in my 40's and do quite a bit of reading both on the computer and in print. I don't wear glasses and would like to prevent over stressing my eyes and if it helps taking a product like this to try and keep my eyes in good health. However, I can't say one way or the other if this product helps. It isn't hurting or bothered my eyes since I have taken it. It also hasn't created anything adverse to my normal routine or created any unpleasant side effects for me either.
B0013OX9NC My ophthalmologist recommended that I start taking lutein and recommended that I take Preservision. This has 10 more milligrams than Preservision and in the stores is about $20 less a month and is recommended by the staff at Sprouts. Then I found it at Amazon. The price at Sprouts in $19, and I saved almost $13 by having it auto-shipped, and there is no shipping cost. I am very please, especially as it is necessary to my vision that I take this. This pill itself is a gel-tab and is fairly small and easy to take.
B0013OX9NC I take one every other day due to the high dose. Little larger than expected so people with small pathways may not like these. I'm a guy that will toss up to four different pills on my tongue and swallow them all together so I have no problem taking these.
B0013OX9NC These Jarrow Lutein 20mg Softgels are marketed as being good for the eyes and, as I am concerned about my failing vision due to diabetes, decided to give these a try. A little on-line research show strong support for Lutein being good for the eyes and my optometrist sells similar supplements, so feel comfortable taking these in the dosage provided. The pills are not too big and seem to be good quality. The results can take quite awhile to manifest so it is hard to quantify that these are making any difference after two week of taking them, but hopefully they are doing what they are purported to do.Recommended!CFH
B0013OX9NC After reaching my 40's, I had noticed a change in the sharpness of my eyesight.  With a lifetime of up to that point 20/20 vision, it was pretty frustrating.  A friend and fellow herbalist recommend that I started taking Lutien and the Jarrow formulas was just the right number of milligrams that I needed at a very good price.Since taking them, my eyesight seems to be improving, though I am very certain that this is a slow process and will much likely be more pronounced over a longer period of time. So while I still do use a set of reading glasses from time to time, I do notice that it is less often.Jarrow Formulas always seems to put out excellent, very reasonably priced supplements. I have yet to be disappointed in anything that I have gotten from Jarrow through Amazon.
B0013OX9NC I've been taking these for a month now and I can't say I've noticed any difference in my vision, but there have been no side effects either. I really wouldn't expect a noticeable improvement in vision, but would take them to help prevent further degradation. These are easily swallowed, brown, ovoid capsules. I've been happy with all four Jarrow products that I've tried.
B0013OX9NC The more you lose eyesight, the more you appreciate it.  This product is supposed to help the eyes against the damaging effects of the type of UV blue light that strikes the retina.I get fewer floaters at night using Lutein.
B0013OX9NC This is a product I have been taking for about 3 months now.THIS brand is a new one to me but all in all it appears tobe the same product and the price is much lower than my last'brand name'.  I am taking this primarily because my Motherhas taken it for about 1 yr. and had her eyes tested and hervision actually got 2% better.  I have hopes of just protectingmy vision...if my vision gets better that is just a bonus!
B0013OX9NC I have been using the Jarrow Formula Lutein for about 3 weeks, during this time I have gained the ability to see through most substances (except oddly.... lead). I have also gained the ability to shoot heat rays from eyes. The only drawback.... I now have this weakness when exposed kryptonite. Crazy stuff....Ok, so Jarrow Formula Lutein has not given me the ability to see through walls, and the ability to shoot heat rays, but it does seem to have helped 
B0013OX9NC It's hard to review supplements accurately but I can give you a glimpse of my experience plus a little research. I have a delicate stomach so I sometimes get heartburn from supplements, but this one did not seem to cause that. I did not notice a benefit either but that can take a long time to show up.According to WebMD, lutein and zeaxanthin are \"linked to lower risk of macular degeneration and cataracts.\"  These compounds are found in various green vegetables such as spinach. But many of us get concerned about vision problems as we get older, so a supplement seems like good insurance.  A consumer-oriented website gave Jarrow Formulas Lutein an \"approved\" rating. They mention that the dose is one that should be helpful yet the cost is reasonable.The source of the lutein and zeaxanthin in this supplement is marigold petals! Some people are likely to be allergic because marigolds are related to chrysanthemums and ragweed. The product also contain soy, one of the top 10 food allergens. Personally I feel that the top 10 food allergens should never be used in supplements, but I suppose manufacturers like to use cheap ingredients.Proceed with caution.
B0013OX9NC Before taking these I asked my ophthalmologist while I was getting my annual exam if it would be helpful. He cautioned against expecting any improvement in my sight, but said it was not a bad idea for long-term ocular health.After taking them for a couple of weeks I have not experienced any improvement in my sight, but it seems to have helped cut down on the close-focus blurries and strain. Granted, it could just be coincidence or my imagination, but I'm pleased enough with the results that I'm willing to pick up another bottle and continue to use it.Zero side effects from usage. The capsules are somewhat large, but remain easy to swallow since they are the gel-type caps (sort of similar to vitamin E caps). They do have a bit of a musty, early smell when you sniff the bottle, but it does not translate to any negative effects, such as bad breath or gastric problems.Definitely worth trying if you're concerned about eye health.
B0013OX9NC I've been taking this for about 3 weeks now and have doubled up on the dosage.  I was experiencing a lot of bad eye strain effects, and at my age that's bothersome.  Watching way too many late movies and Netflix shows.  Plus a recent subscription to Crunchyroll had me watching more anime than usual.  My right eye has weakened more than my left and I think there is a problem when working both together with eye strain on the left.  It's hard to say because I cut back a bit on the TV, but I've not experienced any blurry vision in the last week, and that's even after a long session with reading anime subtitles.The formula itself seems to be well tolerated.  I take medication for thyroid, edema, and cholesterol, and I didn't notice any effect with any of the medications.  I did not notice any issues with any of my other supplements, although once I did get a slightly upset stomach.  I think it was more that I took this stuff without eating much.  I've been on a juicing diet for about 60 days and occasionally, it will give me some stomach trouble.  This usually goes away eating some steamed broccoli and carrots.  It went away like usual, so I can't blame the supplement.  This seems effective enough that I'll continue it and, maybe buy some if the effect lasts till the end of the bottle, I have about half left.  Recommended, but as with any supplement try and see if it has any effect and it may take a month or two to find out.  Stop immediately if it reacts to you or any medications you're on!
B0013OX9NC My doc recommended this additive to replace Lutein loss. Your eyes have Lutein when you are born, but it isn't reproduced by the body. Lutein filters the ultra violet light that eyes are exposed to. I've been taking this for 5 months and the best way that I can determine if it is working is that my eyes don't seem as light sensitive. I still wear sunglasses when I am outdoors, but the effects of this product is most obvious indoors when the sunglasses are gone.
B0013OX9NC So in my experience, Jarrow is an excellent brand and I have noticed a difference in taking their products (versus other brands).  But I had never taken Lutein before.  I have poor vision made worse by some damage from an eye surgery many years ago, so I thought I'd see if this would help.  There could be more long term effect or maybe I just didn't need this herb, but I didn't notice any effect whatsoever (used 1 full bottle, one pill a day).  If you are interested in Lutein, I would try this brand.
B0013OX9NC I've been trying to take this so I can give an honest review, but it smells like something you'd step in in the barnyard.  It's bad enough getting it down, but then when I burp I smell it all over again.  And, it seems like it makes me burp more often, or maybe I just notice it more because of the stench.  I would have to say it just doesn't agree with me.  I'm still trying to take it, but yuck.  My cousin's doctor recommended this to her because she has macular degeneration and she swears by it.  I wanted to try it because I'm nearing fifty and have noticed that my eyesight is not as good as it used to be.
B0013OX9NC My Mother has a rare form of macular degeneration and has been told to let her family members know so they can be checked for the same disease.  Once checked, the optomerist told me to take lutein for my eye health and I did not have macular degeneration as of now.  This lutein formula is just what I was looking for to keep eyes healthy.  Jarrow Formula Lutein is one of the best on the market and mine came from Amazon.  If you are concerned about your eyes' health please check out this product and I think you will be pleased..Jarrow Formulas Lutein 20mg, 60 Softgels
B0013OX9NC I don't know if it's natural or what but the ones I received kind of smelled and like to stick together.
B0013OX9NC I got this product because  I was concerned with my eyes. I used to go tanning at the salon and I didn't always use the eye protection. And over the past few months I have noticed that when i am driving at night the lights of on coming cars seem ridiculously bright. I bought this product in hopes that it would help my eyes to heal. I have read other reviews on this product and they rave on how awesome it is, so i hope it works for me.
B0013OX9NC This is a good source of lutein and it's liquid, so it absorbs quickly. I always try to avoid tablets for supplements, as your body doesn't assimilate them as well as gels or capsules.I would also suggest anyone who is looking to improve eyesight engage in eating better and exercising. You can do this by eating produces high in lutein (like kale and spinach - organic is much, much better). Get a juicer and mix these with organic carrot and organic apples for maximum benefit and to improve the flavor.For eye exercises, the book Eye Yoga is FANTASTIC.So get your lutein supplement and supplement it with a little extra effort and you'll be happy with the results.
B0013OX9NC I have some health related issues with my eyes so I wanted to see if Lutein made a noticeable difference. I've heard lots of positive things about it. Honestly it's hard after just one bottle with this supplement to tell if it's make a difference. It was easy to take and didn't give me any adverse side effects like some can do.
B0013OX9NC I have no way to actually measure the direct effect this has had on me in the month I've been taking it. Nothing bad at least. What I can say is that, unlike other supplements, this one does not have a funky taste (it actually has no taste at all). The pills are small and easy to swallow. I've read a lot about Lutein, which is why I decided to give it a try. You should definitely do your own research before deciding to take any supplements (and check with your doctor). If you decide to go with Lutein, then this one seems fine to me!
B0013OX9NC I had Lasik surgery about 5 years ago and I try to maintain my vision as best I can.  I have been taking Lutein supplements for a short time and health magazines always recommend it for better vision.  These small pills last 2 months if taken daily and they are the size of a peanut M&M.  They are coated and are easy to swallow.  If you are looking for a Lutein supplement, this is a good buy.  I highly recommend it.
B0013OX9NC The pills are small, about the size of a pea. Or an edamame bean. They are soft and super easy to swallow. No stickiness, no smell, nothing negative. Seen no side-effects, and will wait to see if it helps my eyesight. Right on the 20/40 border for near vision, and my doctor said to try this and lets see (ha ha) what happens. Lutein was found to help prevent eyesight in a study cited by the normally very skeptical Center for Science in the Public Interest, so I've subscribed to this product now.
B0013OX9NC Daverat's Wife speaking (pls be kind RE: Typos; I have arthritis) I'm starting to experience some minor focusing issues that all people usually find they suffer in the mid 30s through their 40s and I also have a concern about Age-Related Macular Degeneration in my family, also known as: AMD.  So, I began looking at Lutein supplements and other \"Vision Vitamins'.  Specifically, I brought this bottle of plain Jarrow Lutein supplement and their jazzier soundingJarrow Formulas Vision Optimizer, 90 Capsulesinto my doctor's office for his opinion.  He's a GP who is quite open to vitamins and food supplements for both treatment and prevention as long as he knows what's in them and can look up any potential problems they might cause.  He cleared me to take this Lutein supplement for prevention without any problems.  I showed him the other bottle and after he put HIS reading glasses on to check the ingredients out in his side effects App on his computer, he began to frown.  Long story short, he told me to toss the other ones and take THIS Jarrow Lutein for AS LONG AS I COULD AFFORD TO since it is a PREVENTATIVE and not a miracle supplement that gives you results in 30 days.  He felt everyone over 35 should adding Preventative doses of Lutein to their supplements.I like Jarrow products for price and simplicity  As long as you CHECK the formulations and ingredients dosages, they can be very effective and economical.  I regularly order theirJarrow Formulas Whey Protein, French Vanilla, 2 Poundwith my monthly Subscribe & Save items.  It's the one of the best Whey Proteins my husband and I have ever used and at such a good price.  Likewise I'm impressed with this Lutein because it contains 20 Mgs of Lutein plus the added ingredient of 1 mg of Zeaxanthin.  My doctor told me that people used to say all you needed was 6 Mgs of Lutein for protection against AMD but that was the bare minimum to see any benefit at all.  He was the one who told me that 20 mgs was the current thinking and that Lutein without any Zeaxanthin is pretty much useless.  Apparently Zeaxanthin is the material that makes up the Macula of your retina and having the 2 together is the best protection.  This Jarrow Lutein has the 1 mg of Zeaxanthin in addition to the 20 Mgs of Lutein.  the two together form 1 preventative supplement to help  prevent the onset of AMD as you get older.Taking a  Daily Lutein and Zeaxanthin supplement is largely a protection against Age-Related Macular Degneration.  I have Aunts who suffer from this and I wanted the protective benefits that taking a daily supplement can provide.  The people rating this based on improved vision seem to misunderstand what the purpose of such a supplement is.  You will NOT LIKELY see short term results.  This is a Supplement you take for THE LONG HAUL from mid life til you die in the hopes that it affords you some significant protection from Macular Degeneration due to age.  Studies have indicated that this dosage and formulation can have a positive effect on your risk but that's it.  Lutein is no magic pill against middle-aged myopia.  You will still need your reading glasses, I'm afraid.I am pleased that the dosage & formulation are correct, the price is economical and there are no added on, unnecessary ingredients with potentional side effects on medications such as other \"pumped up\" vision supplements have.  In fact, the major source of the Lutein in the Jarrow formulation is Marigold Petal Extract, an old herbalists remedy dating back thousands of years.  As far as we were able to see, neither my doctor nor I could find any potential interactions.  Vegans, however, be aware that there is beeswax and gelatin in the softgels.  There is also Soybean oil if that is of a concern to some. I will be adding this to my monthly delivery schedule and I'm so glad Jarrow makes basic supplements in addition to their more \"out there\" supplements for the adventurous self-helpers.Remember, taking your Lutein is like eating your carrots - you may not notice the difference for years to come but hoo-boy you'll be glad you did it one day.
B0013OX9NC This product contains Lutein and Zeaxanthin, two plant pigments that are also present in the human eye. Because of this, research suggests both are helpful in preventing eye problems. Some research also suggests Lutein may be helpful in improving skin health, taken orally, or applied directly. I make a cream out of Lutein (and other pigments like Lycopene) that I apply at night. Just be warned Lutein is a dark red dye, and a little goes a long way when mixed with creams.This is a good Lutein product, with some oil and mixed tocopherols (a form of Vitamin E, included to keep the product fresh). This is the best way to take Lutein, because it needs some fat to be absorbed properly. The price of this product, when discounted, is pretty good.My eyes are pretty good, and I had LASIK surgery ten years ago. Since I have started taking Lutein, my vision seems even crisper, but it is hard to tell if this is Lutein-related, since I take other supplements. I take this product knowing it is helping to prevent future eye problems.Overall, this is a solid product for a good price.
B0013OX9NC I've been using Jarrow products for a long time and have never been disappointed.  This is no exception.  I'm convinced that Lutein helps protect the eyes and vision protection supplements now often include Zeaxanthin.  I've read that the optimum ratio might be 5 to 1.  This product is 20 to 1, so it might be a bit light on the Zeaxanthin.  The price seems to be fair.  You can get similar warehouse brand products for a bit less and you can pay much more for name brand.  I think it's good value and good insurance for your eye sight.
B0013OX9NC Lutein is found in many dark green leafy vegetables such as kale, spinach, turnip greens, and collard greens, etc., and is good for maintaining good vision and prevent macular degeneration.  The macula is a small area of the retina responsible for central vision.  Lutein accumulates more in the peripheral areas of the retina while zeaxanthin accumulates more in the macula region.  Both lutein and zeaxanthin are believed to have anti-oxidative properties and protect the retina/macula from harmful blue light.  My family and I try to maintain a well balanced nutrition but it's helpful to supplement regular leafy green vegetable intake with Lutein supplements.What's good about Jarrow Formulas (JF) Lutein:>Each softgel contains 20mg of lutein (esters) and 1mg of zeaxanthin.>My family's eyes tend to be less strained and our annual eye exams indicate no vision health problems.What's questionable about Lutein supplements in general:>20mg of lutein esters usually yields approx. 10mg of free lutein.  The amount of free lutein absorbed by the retina/macula is unknown.>We've taken the JF brand of 20mg lutein supplements since 2010 and there are no noticeable differences compared to other brands' 20mg geltabs.>There's no DV or Daily (recommended) Value for lutein or zeaxanthin.  Possible side effects of excessive lutein intake.>Each geltab contains mostly soybean oil and the softgel ingredients of gelatin, glycerin, and water.Overall:Taking lutein geltab supplements is helpful but it's more important to maintain a balanced, healthy diet with plenty of leafy green vegetables, wear blue light blocking sunglasses, and don't overstrain one's eyes, etc., to maintain good vision and retinal/macular health.
B0013OX9NC I'm giving it 5 stars because it is a small, very easy to swallow pill. Still not sure if it is permanently useful for my eyes because I've only used it a few weeks but haven't noticed eye strain as much as I used to have when I'm on the computer too long,like 14 hours at a time, so it must be helping with that because I'm not using any other product that helps that. So I could assume Lutein is good and hope that this is working. I'll keep using it and see if it gets rid of all my eye strain problems. Since the Vine program is now requiring a review of every product before you can get more and new ones come out every 3rd Thursday of the month and the next just a week later, I will not have time to try anything for long before the review has to be written. Also will have to write reviews for products as I understand them to work for items that haven't even been delivered before the 4th Thursdays of each month comes out and will just have to update them after they come and I can actually have time to try them.UPDATE: I've been using this for sometime now and NO MORE eye strain. Feels good to be able to watch TV or be on the computer as much as I want and no eye strain and no ruptured blood vessels. I sleep better too because I don't have eye burn when I close my eyes to sleep. Great stuff....
B0013OX9NC I have been using Lutein for years as macular degeneration runs in my family. When I saw the Jarrow formula I was thrilled as I know that Jarrow makes good products. I was not disappointed. The gel was small and easy to swallow, and these pills will be replacing my previous Luteins in my daily vitamin routine.
B0013OX9NC It is common to avoid taking care of your eyes. Since taking Lutein, my eyes feel younger. I can feel the difference.
B0013OX9NC My eye doctor recommended that I use Lutein and I started using these about two weeks ago. I don't see a lot of vision improvement, but am using it more as a preventative for macular degeneration. So far after two years use, no macular degeneration!I really like these particular softgels. They go down easy, don't upset my stomach and seem to be more organic than the last brand that I purchased. I will continue to use these.
B0013OX9NC I've always had exceptional eyesight (20/10), but as I've grown older I've been noticing a decline in my vision. After doing some research I decided to start taking a Lutein supplement. I wanted a supplement that contained at least 20mg of Lutein at a reasonable price. This Jarrow Formulas product fit the bill, so I ordered a bottle. I've got about a week's worth left and I can definitely say my vision has improved. I can't say it's solely from the Lutein because I also quit drinking soda/pop after finding out that Aspartame is bad for eyes. Additionally, I started taking a Bilberry supplement around the same time I began taking this Lutein. Regardless, I know my vision is improving so I will continue to take Lutein and Bilberry supplements. Thanks for reading.
B0013OX9NC My DH has terrible trouble with his eyes getting inflamed, his sight floating so his new glasses don't work that well, and just eye strain in general. He's been to any number of opthamologists and regular doctors, none of whom have been able to tell him what is wrong. All they can recommend is eye drops to keep his eyes from being too dry. I do know his father had macular degeneration, so we're going to try this formula to see if it will help him. The lutein, as I understand it, concentrates in the macula of the eye and helps with focus. The pills themselves are soft and not too large, kind of like a roundish Vitamin E capsule but a little larger, so I hope he'll take them.
B0013OX9NC I figure these would at best help with an ongoing macular issue and at worst do nothing. The seem to have done nothing whatsoever in 2 weeks. The softgels are easy to swallow - not as large as a typical vitamin and that's a good thing. They did not cause any digestive upset or issues - some supplements can have unforseen & unfortunate stomach consequences. However, there was no change any sort noted with regard to actual eye care. Oh well... at least they did no harm.
B0013OX9NC An important thing to know about Lutein is that It is best absorbed with a high fat meal.  If you are taking this and are on a low fat diet, perhaps take this with your Omegas or with some type of healthy fat. Otherwise, you are losing effectiveness of the supplement .  For those not seeing benefits, please try taking them with a high fat meal and see if it makes a difference.My diet is already pretty high in Lutein.  One bottle lasted me for two months.  During the two months that I took the supplement, I did notice an improvement in my vision.  So, although I had an adequate intake of Lutein, the extra oomph did make a difference.I would recommend giving this a try if vision health is a concern.  I learned that I could add a cup of cooked spinach to my diet each day and get the same amount of lutein.  I do think the supplements have value and Jarrow is a company that I trust. I would recommend them.
B0013OX9NC I have been using it for over 7 days...I have noted a better feel to my skin...I do not have bad eyes, but at 47 years old I do note an improvement...well worth the money
B0013OX9NC Easy on the digestive tract and if they help postpone cataract surgery then they are worth it as I am not looking forward to that.
B0013OX9NC The label tells me what it DOESN'T have ie gluten, wheat etc but fails to tell me that the SOYBEAN OIL is GMO! Over 86% of the CORN and SOY in the USA IS a GMO ingredient.  I will no longer buy this product and will search for a NON GMO product.
B0013OX9NC I'll be staying on this product for 1 year.  In the last 4 years I have developed 'floaters' in my eyes and luckily no macular degeneration.  I also had cateracts removed in 2011.I can't say I have noticed any change in vision in the last 2 months but the proof will be when I see my eye doctor in 10 months and she can tell me if my eyes have changed for the worse. If not, I will stay on the product. $60 a year for a chance to safeguard good eye health is worth it.
B0013OX9NC Lutein seems to be one of those supplements that actually has a solid backing of research to back it up.Basically it helps your eyes, and can help some conditions that effect the eyes, such as macular degeneration, cataracts, among others.The 'pill' (gel pack) is quite small, easy to swallow.  If you have eye conditions (or don't want to), this may be an easy decision.
B0013OX9NC What I like about this product mostly, is its affordable price. For someone who has been using mostly Occuvite, and Bausch and Lomb Vision Eye Vitamin, and paying a nice amount of change to keep it going, this product I was hoping, more like praying actually, could be a viable substitute for the more expensive options. I know that in the Lutein department it certainly delivers, but since I am no expert on the subject, I ask myself over and over: \"is this Jarrow Lutein as good as Occuvite, per say?\". The answer is not immediately answered because as we all know, this kind of product must be used with regularity, month after month, in order to accurately decide if its doing what is supposed to do. So, what is the product supposed to do? For one, make my eyes stronger, provide much needed nutrition to avoid serious eye loss, or diseases related to the eyes. Like any part of the body the eyes have to be provided with all the help they need, and Lutein, I keep reading, is quite a healthy boost for their performance.The price in which these soft gels are sold make them very affordable to use month after month. Also the fact that only one a day is the recommended daily use makes a bottle of 60 last two months. Yes! I can see myself being able and happy to provide this much needed nutrient to my eyes, versus more costly options. At the same time I wonder if the more expensive offerings provide a more complete package, sort of speak.Either way, it is highly appreciated that I had the chance to use Jarrow Formulas Lutein, 20mg, 60 count, and I have Amazon to thank for that. It is a great alternative to the higher priced products out there. On the other hand, is very hard to make a determination on just 30 days of using a new product, for we all know it takes regular use to fully appreciate its virtues and setbacks, but those are the rules of the game, and I was expected to render a verdict within 30 days. I could have waited a few more days, but I am sure I will like them the same when the time comes. 60 soft gels for under $10? What is there not to like? Perhaps Jarrow is the one company who thinks about the prize being more affordable, and if that is their mentality of business then I praise them, just as long as their products are as good as they certainly sound. 4 Stars for now.
B0013OX9NC Jarrow Formulas' \"Lutein\" is a dietary suppliment for support of visual function and protection of the macula. The bottle contains 60 softgels which while big can be easily swallowed. There is 20 mg of Lutein and 1 mg of Zeaxanthin in each softgel.Since there is history of eye deterioration I thought this would be a product to try. I have been taking 1 softgel per day as directed on the package for a little over a week now, but it is difficult to almostimpossible to determine the effectiveness of the product. Some doctors prescribe lutein for their senior patients, others say that it will not harm or help your eyes. I have taken other brands of lutein in the past without any side effects. I have found that even with taking this \"Lutein\" with food as directed on the package that about an hour or 2 hours after taking the softgel I experience some stomach and/or lower G.I pain which last several hours. It is not severe pain but is discomforting. Perhaps it is a coincidental that I take the softgel and then experience pain but it has been 9 days in a row. I don't think I have ever had zeaxanthin in the other lutein I have taken and wonder if that may be the cause of the discomfort.
B0013OX9NC Love all the Jarrow vitamin supplements. Jarrow has done it again with the amazing Lutein formula for increased eye support. My 80+ father in law who had macular degeneration swears by this.
B0013OX9NC I've reached that age where it seems every printed page is getting smaller, every attempt to focus my eyes requires concentration and a few seconds, and every morning and night is a new experiment in decreasing degrees of visual acuity, which is to say, I need reading glasses more and more and I'm about to give up entirely on trying to focus on anything less than three feet away whenever I am tired (early in the morning or late at night). I mentioned this problem to a gentleman even older than I am, and he recommended a vitamin that contained lutein. Since I already take a regular multivitamin, I figured adding lutein to my current regimen might help me out just as well.What I have read about lutein is that it will not help you regain visual ability or better focus or anything like that. What it will do is prevent your macula and lens from experiencing as much of the degeneration that comes naturally with aging (maybe). The good news is, these soft gels are relatively small, about the size of a 400 i.u. vitamin E, and just as easy to take. The bad news is, well, there is no bad news other than, I cannot tell if these are helping my eyes are not. I'm prepared to say that I will err on the side of caution and maybe take this product on a regular basis if I feel my eyes are getting \"worser and worser\" than they would normally, but short of that, I don't think this is something I need to take on regular basis. At least, I can't see (sorry) taking it every day just yet.
B0013OX9NC About five years ago, I found that I needed to start using glasses for reading.  Recently someone recommended this product to help decrease my reliance on the glasses, and I have to say that so far it seems to work.  Don't get me wrong!  I haven't been able to toss out my glasses, but the fact is that my mid range and distance vision have both improved a bit since I started taking Jarrow's Lutien tablets.  I've been using two tablets a day, and where I've noticed the most improvement is in seeing with dim light.  In a dark room, before the lutien, I had difficulty reading my watch without glasses on - since beginning to take the Jarrow product, I find I can read it without the extra lenses.  Not a miracle cure by any means, but its good to have a product which produces such easily measurable results!The tablets are easy to swallow, and so far I haven't seen any notable side effects beyond the vision improvements.
B0013OX9NC I just turned 48 years young a few days ago and I have enjoyed many years of good vision.  However, I just started using reading glasses prescribed by my doctor with just the faintest magnification.  I have only been taking these a month, but many studies (and my doctor) recommend adding this supplement to your daily routine.  The Jarrow brand is one that I trust and these are easy to take.  I will be continuing to order these from Amazon.
B0013OX9NC Jarrow Formulas Lutein 20mg, 60 softgels is an excellent product.They are very easy to swallow and if you are over fifty I think you should try them,They really help aging eyes. My husband had an eye problem a few months ago when he saw the eye doctor he said it could be the start of a detached retina. Taking lutein has really improved his condition. I take it as a preventative. A bottle lasts us a month. I will not stop taking it. I would recommend you try it.
B0013OX9NC Don't let anybody tell you that they can see just as well at 70 as they did at 30. It's a smoke screen. Everybody's sight begins to diminish with age. If I can get something into my system to assist in staving off the detrimental effects of age, I'm going for it. Jarrow Lutein is specially formulated to aid vision and comes in easy-to-swallow softgels. It gives me a feeling of insurance against macular degeneration, and I'm sure it helps. Anything you can do for your eyes is a good thing.
B0013OX9NC For those with a Lutein deficiency, this is a pricey, but useful product. I wouldn't buy it unless you're convinced that you need this supplement. Eat lots of veggies instead. :)
B0013OX9NC I've been taking Lutein supplements for a couple of decades with the hope it would prevent or delay cataracts - but it appears that strategy didn't work. I am in the mid phase of cataracts anyway - age 69. According to one web site, researchers found that Lutein and Zeaxanthin reduce the probability of cataracts by about 19% for men and 22% for women, which I agree is statistically significant.  However, 19% certainly isn't anywhere close to 100%. It appears I am in the 81% category. Maybe it would have been worse or occurred earlier if I had not taken Lutein all these years. The minimum amount of Lutein necessary for good results is cited to be 6 to 10 mg per day. So 20 mg in this product should be more than minimally sufficient.
B0013OX9NC There's 20 mg of Lutein per capsule, which is more than most of the eye-oriented multivitamins on the market. Doing some research on Lutein, it is naturally found in many greens such as kale, collard, and spinach. There's no conclusive data that indicates a lutein supplement/diet would help reduce macular degeneration or prevent it, and there's no data that indicates the supplement would actually improve your vision. Preventing blue light from damaging the eye is definitely important, and that is why we have sunglasses and special optics that filter out harmful UV A/B/C radiation.I haven't noticed any side effects from taking the Jarrow lutein supplement, but I also haven't noticed any significant improvement in my vision. I did note that it contains twice the dosage per capsule of Lutein versus the Bausch and Lomb Ocuvite brand supplement.Overall: 5/5 stars
B0013OX9NC There haven't been a huge number of authoritative studies on lutein supplementation, so it's hard to know whether the benefits outweigh the risks. A quick internet search turned up one study showing that by the end of 12 months, people suffering from age-related macular degeneration who were given lutein showed vision improvement, while the placebo group did not.The Harvard School of Public Health also published a study on the benefits of dietary lutein and zeaxanthin on cataracts for men and women ages 45 to 75. They found that people who had the largest dietary intake of foods containing these carotenoids have about a 20% lower risk of developing cataracts than the people who had the lowest dietary intake.However, though these carotenoids are probably beneficial for the eyes, they are not without risks. In a study conducted by the National Eye Institute over a six-year period, researchers found that beta-carotene, another carotenoid, increased the risk of lung cancer in smokers. This raises enough of a concern  about carotenoids in general that I personally would avoid taking lutein in supplement format unless I had a very specific reason to do so, and was testing my vision to check to see whether or not I had reached those benchmarks.Now, about these pills specifically: when you open the bottle, it smells really disgusting. To me personally, it smells like old shrimp, but my partner thought it smelled like old cleaning supplies stored in a cabinet in the garage. In any case, poor reviews all around on the smell. Unfortunately, when I broke open the pills, they taste exactly like they smell. I'd recommend taking the pills prior to a meal, so that you don't burp up any of that odor.When I broke the pills open, I found that it was a clear gelcap housing a thick, pasty orange oil which stained my hands yellow. If you want to take lutein in and oil form, this is a good bet. The primary ingredient is marigold petals, which you may not know is used to color the egg yolks of commercially raised chickens so that consumers are fooled into thinking the chickens have a healthier diet than they do. The gel caps themselves are smaller than the average vitamin pill.
B0013OX9NC This formula of Lutein is exactly what my opthamologist recommended I take for vision support - one a day is plenty, too, which makes this a two month supply if taken daily, but I was told three days a week, or every other day was enough, so I do the every other day.
B0013OX9NC It's hard to evaluate supplements, but at least I can say I have not experienced any ill effects :)I'll report back after a couple more weeks. The pills are easy to take.
B0013OX9NC Safe and effective luctein supplement for those who need it.  The pill is small and easy to swallow as well.  There is a lot of research to suggest these have a lot of benefits for eye health especially.  Jarrow always puts out quality products.  Never once had any issue with their supplements.
B0013OX9NC I am taking Lutein to prevent macular degeneration as it has hit members of my family. So since I am taking it in a preventative capacity, it is hard to tell if it works. But this is cheaper than the Lutein than the grocery store brand. I have really liked Jarrow's products and would not hesitate to recommend them. These pills are easy to swallow and don't have any after taste. They did not upset my stomach.Lutein is important to preserve and protect vision and this is a high quality low cost way to get it.
B0013OX9NC I take a series of supplements as part of my diet and I've recently started to take this lutein for my eyesight. The pill is not too large and easy to swallow. You may not be able to stop macular degeneration from hitting you, but these supplements suppossedly help eye health and I'm willing to try them out. These softgels contain nearly the same ingredients that other eye health supplements have. I have felt no side effects since starting to take these and hopefully they are protecting my eyes!
B0013OX9NC I know many people swear by Lutein, but it has done nothing for my vision that I actually notice. Everyone's different I guess.
B0013OX9NC I started taking Lutein after doing some research into some intermittent eye problems I was having. I noticed an improvement within several weeks, continuing through to a few months.  I have also recommended this to a family member who has macular degeneration.  I'm not sure how well this works on simply \"aging eyes\" but there is growing positive research on the effects on degenerative conditions.  I would even say that my night vision has improved.  As for the basics, I found these capsules easy to swallow, with no gastric upset or noticeable ill effects. I also have a good opinion about Jarrow in general, so I was happy to find this product at a relatively good price and with the subscribe and save option and additional discount.
B0013OX9NC Lutein is something of a wonder product for your eyes and believed to help decelerate horrific age-related disorders such as macular degeneration. I've always had a bad eyesight and after a health scare a couple of years ago I've been very careful about what I eat. There are a range of studies showing the benefits of lutein and although you can find it in dark leafy vegetables, eating spinach and kale every day can get tedious. These tablets are a reasonable alternative and although you won't notice any benefits immediately, I've noticed that when combined with diet there is a gradual but noticeable difference. The soft gels are easy to swallow and incorporate into any morning routine.As an aside, if you want to look after your eyes, you can't go wrong with a daily dose of kale, spinach, carrots and broccoli - the combination seems to eliminate floaters and improve general eye health. Although my experience is only anecdotal, I'd highly recommend increasing your lutein intake if you're having any sorts of eye health issues.
B0013OX9NC I have taken other Jarrow vitamins, and I find them to actually contain the amount they say they contain (unlike some other brands), so I am confident that these Jarrow Lutein softgels have the Lutein they claim to have. If you are looking for a lutein supplement, the Jarrow brand is a brand you can trust at an affordable price.
B0013OX9NC I've had my glasses since fourth grade, I'm 33 now, and every year my vision gets a little bit worse. My optometrist told me at some point I will have to take pressure drops daily for my eyes as they decline worse with each visit, and I dread getting glaucoma or going blind some day, it's one of my biggest fears as it's a realistic one and I simply love to read and write and watch movies and want to watch my kids grow up. I get twitches in my eyes sometimes and some of the meds I'm on make my vision blurry at times. Enter this supplement, I've been taking it daily and it's been helping a lot, counter acting the blurry vision from my side effects and also I haven't experienced any eye twitching lately, which is great and surprising to me as it's been happening for years. Highly recommended! I'm going to continue using these even after my sample vitamins are gone, hopefully they will keep my eyes healthy for years to come.
B0013OX9NC I am not sure if it is the lutein rather than placebo effect or a combination of the two. I am highly suggestible. In the last ten days since I started taking these daily I have been enrolled in an online seminar intensive and having to spend 10-12 hours a day online looking at screens and reading reading reading.Usually in such a situation my eyes would be killing me but I have not had much discomfort beyond some dryness. I think they are helping. I have not noticed any increased clarity or color perception.I am dead frightened of macular degeneration and I am taking these prophylacticly for that.Web MD says it may be effective for preventing macular degeneration but the only thing is is effective for, for sure, is lutein deficiency... ha!Here is a short quote from that site so you can get some idea as to your relative danger of lutein deficiency:\"Lutein is called a carotenoid vitamin. It is related to beta-carotene and vitamin A. Foods rich in lutein include broccoli, spinach, kale, corn, orange pepper, kiwi fruit, grapes, orange juice, zucchini, and squash. Lutein is absorbed best when it is taken with a high-fat meal.\"Here is the link to the site in case you want to read further. [...]
B0013OX9NC Haven't quite finished 1st bottle and not sure if I've really noticed much difference - will know more once in finish the 2nd bottle.  No complaints at all.
B0013OX9NC I will definitely be ordering Jarrow Formulas Lutein again. As a woman of \"a certain age,\" I have been becoming aware of subtle changes of my vision. I decided to take lutein because of stories I've read in the news, and this product more than filled the bill. My eyes have become dry and irritated. Of course, there are multiple reasons for this to begin, however, noticing a decline in that irritation coincides with my beginning to take this product. Of course, I have no scientific evidence to offer, however, I know what I feel -- and I do feel better. Recommended!
B0013OX9NC Lutein is vitamin good for the eyes, this Jarrow vitaimin is extracted from marigold pedals, laong w/ soybean oil, beeswax and  mixed tocopherols.The softgel consists of  gelatin, glycerinm, nad waterThe recommended dosage is one soft gel per day.
B0013OX9NC My spouse has a degenerative eye disease and was prescribed supplements to help slow down the formation of secondary cataracts as well as assist in general eye health. Of course, like many physicians, he has his own line of supplement products for sale that tend to cost a fortune.However, unlike many physicians pushing supplements, he also provides the full follow-up testing to show whether or not it was actually working...and it was as evidence by the amount of plaque build-up and impact on the lens. So far so good. Of course, the cost still left a lot to be desired.When this came up for review, we opted to give it a try as it contains many of the same active ingredients in roughly the same doses. The Lutein combined with other eye enhancing supplements all in one formula for about 1/4 the cost of what was being prescribed in-house. Now, the physician formula contained other vitamins etc but many were of an inferior quality; for example, B12 in the form of cyanocobalmin rather than the better absorbed and higher quality methylcobalmin. Given the need for B12 in the eye, this was a serious consideration for us; why spend money on something that is inferior. So, we've opted to duplicate the primary substances in the physician formula with better quality supplements available online. This provide a critical piece of the puzzle and have noticed NO difference whatsoever in outcome.It does require taking a few more pills but 
B0013OX9NC I have been a fan of Jarrow Formulas Lutein for the past month. I'm in my late 30s and very near sighted.  I discovered that my eyes were not focusing correctly on objects or books at close distance.  Imagine my horror and surprise!  Of course, I knew these focussing issues were a sign of getting older, and I didn't want to just give into that truth so quickly. That is, I thought I may as well try to help my eyes out.  So I ordered Jarrow's Lutein, 20mg.  In addition, I also started a course of Bilberry supplements. I take one pill of each at dinner time.  So it's been about a month since my freak out moment of aging and my start on Lutein.  Honestly, my issues with focussing on close objects have lessened. I will continue taking Lutein, since I do think it's helping. And with the Bilberry supplement, I think I might be able to stave off bifocal lenses for a few more years.  Of course, all of my good results could just be the placebo effect, but I value my eyesight, and so I'll take it if it is. I think for the price you are paying for Jarrow Lutein, it's quite a value. Always be sure to talk to your PCP about your supplements regimen.
B0013OX9NC I'm approaching seventy years old, which is about the age that both my mom and her brother began to go blind from macular degeneration. Also, extreme nearsightedness runs in both of my parents' families, which explains why my eyesight has never been better than 20/450. I'm also diabetic (type 2, controlled), and to top it off, I'm only a year or so away from needing cataract surgery. So I take care of my eyes and see my ophthalmologist every year. Since I don't eat very much green, leafy vegetables or eggs - two natural sources of lutein and zeaxanthin - I asked my ophthalmologist about taking supplemental lutein/zeaxanthin at my most recent eye exam. He was fairly noncommittal, but he didn't reject the idea either, so I started taking an older men's multivitamin. The vitamin has only 250mcg of lutein, however, so I started looking for more potent sources. I've read a good bit on the subject, and the Jarrow formula with 20mg dosage is in line with recommendations that I've seen. The instructions on the bottle recommend taking one softgel per day with food, and that's the amount that I'm taking. I've also read that the only known side effect of excess lutein consumption is a harmless bronzing of the skin known as carotenaemia.I haven't taken the Jarrow lutein long enough to notice any obvious benefits, but I've used other Jarrow products enough to trust the brand. Being at great risk of macular degeneration and eventual blindness is a big motivator, and I feel more confident now that I'm taking the lutein/zeaxanthin supplement.
B0013OX9NC Lutein and Zeaxanthin are carotenoid antioxidants that are known to help protect the eyes against oxidative stress, thus helping prevent macular degeneration and other vision problems. These compounds are found to concentrate in the eyes as well as skin, breast, and cervical tissues. These compounds are normally obtained in the diet through green leafy vegetables, which most people don't consume much of. For supplements, marigold petal extract is used to get the concentrated doses of these antioxidants. Jarrow's softgels include soybean oil, beeswax, and mixed tocopherols inside the capsule of gelatin, glycerin, and water. The drawback here is that this isn't suitable for those seeking to avoid soy and the gelatin capsule makes it unsuitable for strict vegetarians. A vegetable-based capsule would make this vegan friendly, and I don't see why Jarrow doesn't implement that since they do have a good number of supplements that are suitable for vegans. I find this supplement to be a valuable one and the softgels are easy to consume, though I prefer to break it open to ingest what is inside without swallowing the gelatin. I'm next going to try Jarrow's Vision Optimizer formula and see if that is better - that one uses regular capsules with a variety of antioxidants and herbal compounds (Lutein and Zeanxathin plus much more) without any soybean oil.
B0013OX9NC Supplements are tricky. They are not regulated like traditional drugs and can make all sorts of claims. Take Lutein for example. It is supposed to be important for eye health and result in improved vision. But is this truly the case? And then there is the matter of psychosomatics. You think that the supplement has improved things when, in reality, it may be just your perception that things have improved. Sometimes it is our imagination that, in itself, caused the improvement. Please keep this in mind as you read my review of Jarrow Formulas Lutein.Having offered my disclosure, I can now say that I noticed an immediate improvement in my eyesight after taking Jarrow Formulas Lutein 20 mg. Not eventually, not over time, not after-a-while. Immediately.Things were fuzzy in the morning for me. I had trouble reading small fonts when I first awoke. It took my eyes several minutes, perhaps a half hour, before the haze passed out of my eyes. That was before taking Jarrow Formulas Lutein. Now I see clearly as soon as I awake.This is a truly amazing result from taking any supplement. Is it real or is it Memorex? I can't say. The improvement was rather dramatic and rather fast. I will leave it up to you to decide if this is a figment of my imagination or a real improvement due to taking Jarrow Formulas Lutein. All I can say is that the improvement was noticeable and real to me. Of course, your results may vary.
B0013OX9NC LUTEINI received my Jarrow Formulas Lutein from the Amazon Vine Program. I spend the better part of a day staring at a computer screen topped off with reading in the evening. Recently I noticed that when I would look up I wasn't able to see clearly. Also, I found that reading small type was impossible with out assistance. It was as though my field of vision was pixelating. I do wear glasses as I have astigmatism in both eyes, but even my glasses were not helping.When I saw Jarrow Formulas Lutein, I wanted to give it a try. The soft gels are football shaped and go down easily. There is no unpleasant after taste. With 60 softgels a bottle, I feel it's a good value.At first I didn't notice any change at all. In the meantime, I shifted to less computer time. After only a few weeks, my eyes do not fatigue as easily, and I can read the small type on this bottles label without much effort. If you suffer from eyestrain you may want to check into this product. I certainly appreciate the difference it made for me.
B0013OX9NC Lutein and Zeaxanthin are tiny but powerful anti-oxidants derived from the petals of marigold flowers. We have taken supplements containing these anti-oxidants over the years - my vision is sharper and more in focus today than it was in my youth.  Jarrow Formulas provides a good quality product in an easy to swallow pill in an economical formula - that's a winner in my book.Serving Size: 1 softgel daily, with food.Lutein 20mgZeaxanthin 1mgOther Ingredients: soybean oil, beeswax, mixed tocopherols (natural preservative)Softgel consists of gelatin, glycerin, water.No wheat, no gluten, no dairy, no egg, no fish/shellfish, no peanuts/tree nuts.
B0013OX9NC Do you appreciate your eyes?  Do you want to keep them healthy and maintain good vision for life?What are your options?Eat Kale every day.  Try it, you'll like it. eheheh.  It only takes about 3 hours to steam a big pot until its tender enough to eat.  Add 3 oz. of olive oil and some Season All and it's not all that bad.Take Ocuvite.  It's an expensive supplement for eye health made by Bausch & Lomb.  Check out the vitamin formulation of mainly Lutein & Zeaxanthin.I like spending less time and money and achieving the same results.Most health conscious folks take multi-vitamins and consume foods and supplements rich in Omega 3, antioxidants and perhaps A, C, E and Zinc along with soluble B vitamins.If you are so inclined, all that's necessary is to add a Lutein supplement.  Many companies sell Lutein supplements.I am not a scientist with a complete lab so I have to find a brand at a reasonable price that I trust and hope that it is not made in China and filled with lead paint.For now, I trust Jarrow Formulas, at least until I discover a reason not to.
B0013OX9NC I've taken other lutein supplements, but Jarrow Formulas is more reasonably priced than most.  The pills go down easy and contain 20mg of lutein each vs. 10-40mg for other supplements.  I honestly can't say how well it works, but supposedly it's effective in maintaining healthy eyes.  Leafy greens like kale and spinach are high in lutein.  I think you'd have to eat about half a pound of spinach to get 20mg of lutein though.
B0013OX9NC I've never taken supplements before except for occasional multi-vitamins and am not a fan of them in general, preferring instead to simply eat a healthy diet.  But as a voracious reader, I had lately noticed my eyes feeling tired and decided to give this product a try.Lutein is a chemical which is concentrated in the area of the retina which is responsible for our vision.  Some studies have shown that lutein supplementation increases the pigmentation in the macula, and may help decrease the risk of age-related eye diseases such as macular degeneration and cataracts.  Most research studies have been associated with the elderly and not supplementation among the general population, but there also do not seem to be any harmful side effects to taking it.  (The only side effect I could find to taking too much was possible bronzing of the skin, but that's probably something I could use after a long winter and with an upcoming vacation at the beach!)Lutein is found naturally in leafy green vegetables such as spinach and kale as well as the yolks of eggs, and although we generally eat pretty healthy at our house I'd have to admit it could be a little better sometimes.  The Jarrow softgels, which are just over half an inch long, get their lutein from an extract from marigold petals (one of my favorite flowers) and contain 20mg.  Other ingredients are \"soybean oil, beeswax and mixed tocopherols.\"  The recommendation is for one a day and they seemed to go better when taken with a meal.  I hesitate to mention it but it did seem my eyes felt a little less tired when I started taking these, although I honestly may have only imagined it.
B0013OX9NC I started taking \"eye vitamins\" when my mother's sight began fading due to age-related macular degeneration (abbreviated AREDS).  The key ingredient I look for is lutein.  Unfortunately, the typical eye vitamin is sized like a horse pill, and I have trouble swallowing big pills.  These are not only sized smaller, they are softgels, which means they go down easy!  I am glad I found these.
B0013OX9NC I intend to enjoy active health and my physical senses well into my later years. So I take a lot of supplements (with my doctor's okay), in recommended dosages. Lutein is one for the eyeballs. It is purported to protect vision in the macula and lens.Recommended daily amount is one softgel per day with food. The source for this pill is marigold petals, and there is 20 mg of lutein per serving. There is also Vitamin E as an oil-based carrier, which is nice.
B0013OX9NC Each serving Jarrow Lutein combines 20 mg. lutein with 1 mg. zeacanthin. In a 2007 article in JAMA (Journal of the American Medical Associatoin) Opthamology, Dr. John Paul SanGiovanni of the National Eye Institute, Maryland and colleagues discuss a six-year study that led to the conclusion that \"Study participants reporting the highest dietary intake of lutein/zeaxanthin were statistically less likely to have advanced AMD\" (Age-related Macular Degeneration, which basically means age-related blindness). In a Q&A; on AMD, Dr. Burt Dubow of Insight Eye Care in St. Cloud. MN says, \"There are eye supplements available that contain the essential elements found in dark green leafy vegetables -- primarily lutein and zeaxanthin. Taking these supplements as directed may help forestall the effects of macular degeneration.\"This is one of a number of supplements I take in hopes it will do me some good without expecting undeniable immediate effects (like when I take melatonin or valerian, for example). I get a tiny amount of lutein but no zeaxanthin in the daily \"adults 50+\" vitamin I take, so I think/hope I do well for my eyes by taking Jarrow Lutein.Jarrow Formulas is held in high regard in the natural food industry. Jarrow has won many awards from a number of journals and magazines geared toward natural food, nutrition and vitamin industry insiders. Based on my experience in the industry (I operated natural food co-ops and for-profit stores from the mid-70's into the early 90's) and my familiarity with Jarrow brand supplements (I've used and continue to use quite a few), I rank Jarrow highly among supplement brands in terms of quality and fair pricing.
B0013OX9NC Marketed to promoted eye health , Lutein softgels claim to promote macula health. My mother suffers from degradation of the macula , and this product was recommende by her eye doctor.The effects and impact won't be known for a while , but hopefully this product will stave off the deteriorization for a while.
B0013OX9NC How important is ones eyesight?  About as important as it can be!  I want my eyes to be as healthy as I can make them. Lutein helps to keep the eye healthy.  I was happy that the Amazon Vine Program had  Lutein as an option.  I will continue to buy Jarrow Lutein to help keep my eyes healthy.
B0013OX9NC On the advice of my ophthalmologist I have been using 20 mg of Lutein daily for about four years now.  This product is recommended for macula and lens health.  The bottle contains a 60 day supply of the softgel, easy to swallow capsules.  The ingredient list is:  Lutein (as esters) 20 mg, Zeaxanthin (as esters) 1 mg, soybean oil, beeswax and mixed tocopherols.  Softgel consists of gelatin, glycerin and water.  The label also notes there is no:  wheat, gluten, dairy, eggs, fish/shellfish, peanuts/tree nuts.  Notice that this product does contain soy.The only reason for the rating of four stars over five is because the product I've been using for many years does not include the soy.  Other than that the two brands appear identical.  On the other hand, the price for this product is quite a bit less than the one I'm using now.  When this 60 day supply is about to run out I will have to decide which factor will carry the most weight for re-ordering.
B0013OX9NC Many multivitamins have lutein, but I'd like to be sure I'm getting enough of this nutrient, which is believed to contribute to eye health. We have all kinds of eye issues in our family, and I'd love to avoid getting them. I have one minor issue, and will update the review after using this supplement after a while, after my next eye exam. Meanwhile, this is an easy-to-swallow softgel caplet with 20mgs of lutein per cap.
B0013OX9NC These Lutein pills literally smell like horse manure. The size of the pill is small but I have not been able to get past the smell to regularly take it. I am not a great pill taker and easily gag. Per other reviews they do seem to work.
B0013OX9NC Lutein is one of the most essential nutrients for eye health, especially as we get older. A carotenoid, it works as an antioxidant in the retina by scavenging the free radicals produced by blue light. most of us probably don't get enough lutein in our diet, so the Jarrow Formulas version is a great supplement at a great price.I've been using this product daily for over a month. I'm not really sure if I can tell that it's protecting my vision. I do honestly think that it has been helping with my night vision when I biking, but I have no way to prove that. Hopefully it'll keep improving.
B0013OX9NC My ophthalmologist recommended lutein years ago when I developed a macular problem. Although I have never taken the Jarrow lutein, I have taken others as a supplement. I find theJarrow Formulas Lutein 20mg, 60 Softgelsto be an easy to swallow capsule with no aftertaste and it is available at a reasonable price. I will continue to purchase. The only negative for me is the gelatin capsule, but I'm willing to swallow that minor complaint for the benefits.
B0013OX9NC Lutein is an important pigment (carotenoid) that is important for visual health. There are studies showing that it is important to lower the risk of cataracts and age related macular degeneration.This supplement contains both lutein and zeaxanthin, a related antioxidant.Each capsule contains 20mg of lutein and 1mg of zeaxanthin from marigold. The capsules are small and easy to swallow. To those who can't get enough lutein and zeaxanthin from dietary sources or merely need more, this is a good supplement. I like the Jarrow brand and it's sold at a good price, therefore I highly recommend this.
B0013OX9NC This is a high quality Lutein supplement for a company I trust. I would highly recommend it for anyone who takes Lutein.
B0013OX9NC Don't we all want to be healthy?  Shouldn't we want to have products available to help us maintain or improve our health?  That is what we have here.
B0013OX9NC I have to admit I had never heard of Lutein before receiving this.  That wouldn't surprise many I suppose, but I am someone that is a strong believer in healthy supplements keeping us feeling better, and keeping the doctor away much better than the proverbial apple.  But I am so glad I decided to try it, for it has helped greatly with an odd problem I had with focusing my eyes in the morning.  I work from home and stay up very late.  An early riser and greeter of the sparkling dawn I am not.  Waking up late especially over the last 6 months has seen me having this odd, focusing problem where for the first half hour or so I seem to have a blurry type of double vision.  Very subtle and not all that alarming but definitely there.  A look online at the symptom just leaves one scared to death of it possibly being a brain tumor or diabetes.  But this is not something that lasts long or fits the various other symptoms of those frightening categories at all. It always clears up after a short time and doesn't return until the next morning. (The closet I came to it being something benign is dryness of the eyes after a nights sleep.  Eye drops upon awakening helped, but not all that much)...Enter Lutein, something I came across with excellent reviews that I decided to try, feeling I had nothing to lose anyway...  Well it has been about two weeks taking this now and I already have seen a very noticeable improvement in my morning vision.  I can't really find any info online that backs up my theory that this supplement is totally responsible for the success.  But I can tell you that since starting to take this once a day I have not changed my bedtime, continued the eye drops, or done anything else that would justify my morning vision seeing such an improvement.  And the problem really has gotten much better.  In fact it has gotten too where I don't remember every morning, or are really taking much notice of my focus being blurry upon awakening now since it has all but disappeared.  As for the brand, Jarrow products are one that I am no stranger too and take other of their supplements already.  They are always delivered fresh, quickly, and are reasonably priced.  I know this Lutein is advertised as protecting the macula and makes no mention of my particular problem.  But the many favorable reviews on this stuff does add convincing testimony to Lutein being very effective for a number of vision problems.  All I know is I am one of them now, and I highly recommend Jarrow's Lutein... : )
B0013OX9NC Jarrow Formulas Lutein (20mg) is a duo of Lutein from marigold petal extract and Zeaxanthin, also from marigold petal extract.  Though Lutein and Zeaxanthin are considered minor carotenoids, they provide benefits beyond beta-carotene.  Specifically, they \"support visual function and to protect the health of eye tissues as we age.\"  Like many supplements, there is overlapping benefit in the form of potential cardiovascular support.I took this supplement for 30 days.  Overall, I did notice some benefit to my vision but it is hard to describe.  I guess the closest thing would be \"everything seems clearer.\"  I did not notice any change in eye moisture - my eyes are still generally kind of dry, but that is mostly because I stare at a computer screen all day without blinking as much as I should.  At any rate, this looks like one of those supplements that I will continue to take / add to my daily regimen.  I currently use several Jarrow Formulas supplements and I have had consistently good results with them.  I consider them a trusted brand.
B0013OX9NC Some year back I had a scare when during a routine eye exam for glasses, my optometrist said that he saw evidence that I may be going through the onset of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). He suggested a second opinion from another specialist, so I did it immediately. The second OD did an extensive in-depth exam, and said that it was not conclusive, but among the things that he suggested was that I start taking lutein on a daily basis. I followed his advice.ThisJarrow Formulas Lutein 20mg, 60 Softgelscontains 20 mg lutein and 1 mg zeaxanthin, which is a bit more potent than the Ocuvite Eye Vitamin & Mineral Supplement that I've been taking (with 6 mg lutein and 150 mg of omega-3), and is a bit more cost effective, especially since I'm already taking omega-3 on a daily basis. The small amount of zeaxanthin in the Jarrow Formulas product is found naturally in foods such as spinach, romaine lettuce, broccoli, zucchini, and various greens, and is said to help a bit with AMD, especially with those exposed to heavy smokers.Macular degeneration is nothing to mess with, especially for one who photography is an important part of my life. At the time of my initial inconclusive diagnosis, I was a smoker, and the fear of AMD made me quit.There are enough studies and clinical trials out there that have shown that there's evidence of a relationship between low plasma concentrations of lutein and zeaxanthin, and an increased risk of developing age-related macular degeneration. Some of these studies support the view that supplemental lutein and/or zeaxanthin will help protect against AMD, and that's enough for me.So does this product work? Have I seen any miraculous changes in my vision? No I have not, but I use it for maintenance, and since I quit smoking a few years ago, the combination may be why my eye health has not degraded. The small softgels are easy to swallow, and I like the idea that this is in a stronger concentration than the original that I was taking at the suggestion of my optometrist.On a personal basis, I can only suggest that you discuss it with your eye care professional first, as your results may vary.TheJarrow Formulas Lutein 20mgis a cost-effective product in a softgel form. At the one per day suggested dosage, you have a two month supply compounded to replenish the vital nutrients your eyes can lose as you age. It's a good way to help with proper retinal function and supp
B0013OX9NC Lutein is a substance found in many vegetables, but especially leafy ones like spinach and kale. It's known for its contribution to eye health, since it can be found as a pigment in the human eye. It is believed to act as a light filter, protecting the eye from damage. However, lutein has also been linked (less conclusively) to cancer and heart disease prevention.While lutein is typically found in multivitamins these days, the amount is often very small. Fortunately, Jarrow Formulas provides a larger source of lutein, at 20mg (from marigold petal extract). This is the amount consumed in the diets of some non-American population groups. The formula also includes 1mg of zeaxanthin, which is similar in structure and function to lutein.Jarrow Formulas has a good reputation and adheres to the FDA's Good Manufacturing Practices. Since supplements are unregulated, it's good to know that Jarrow takes the quality and potency of its supplements very seriously. I feel confident I'm getting what is on the label of the bottle.The pills are peanut sized softgels that are easy to swallow. In addition, the price is very reasonable. Since lutein is fat soluble, the recommendation of one softgel a day may be a little unnecessary. One every two to three days would be more economical. But, since it dissolves in fat, it's important to take with food.Overall, I'm impressed by Jarrow's lutein formula. I take a lot of supplements daily (including other lutein formulas) and am very impressed by the quality of the product.
B0013OX9NC Jarrow Formulas Lutein soft gels are a necessary supplement for your eyes.  I really enjoy Jarrow Formulas products and this one is no exception.  The lutein comes in easy-to-swallow soft gels.  Be sure to take them with a small glass of water because dry swallowing them will give back a funny after taste.  I am starting to feel the effects of lutein after taking them for a couple of weeks.  If you are looking for a lutein supplement for your daily help then you'll want to pick up a bottle today.
B0013OX9NC Jarrow Formulas Lutein 20mg, 60 SoftgelsI've been taking the Lutein for the better part of a month. So far I absolutely have noticed a difference and in a good way. I was noticing a \"darkening\" of the vision in my left eye, which I haven't dealt with, with my doctor yet. I take a lot of vitamins and added the Lutein. There is a definite brightening of my left eye vision. Yes I need to get my eyes examined anyway but in the meantime it is amazing to see a difference. I will be reporting this to my doctor and see what else is needed. Sometimes you take a supplement and notice nothing, in this case I did and it's good. There have been no adverse reactions so I'll be continuing to take this formula with the zeaxanthin.
B0013OX9NC These soft gel capsules are small and easy to swallow. I experience no undesirable flavor when consuming the pill.The capsules consist of marigold petal extract; each tablet provides 20mg of lutein and 1mg of zeaxanthin. The other ingredients consist of soybean oil, beeswax and mixed tocopherols. The gel capsule is made from gelatin, glycerin and water.I am unable to determine whether or not my eye health has improved, but if these extracts contribute to macular protection and visual function, as the product claims, this supplement is a welcome addition to my diet.
B0013OX9NC Got these as a substitute for the Preservision that my husband takes. These are the same shape, different color and less expensive by a lot. I expect that they will be just as helpful. Easy to swallow.
B0013OX9NC I spend all day at the computer and have sensitive eyes, so I'm open to trying almost anything to protect my eyes and improve my general eye health. After using this supplement for almost a month, I have noticed no discernible improvement in eye health. I don't expect a supplement to improve my vision. But this didn't do anything at all. No reduction in eye strain. No reduction in light sensitivity. Nothing.
B0013OX9NC I had the opportunity via the Amazon Vine Program to sample, Jarrow Formulas Lutein for eye health.  I've had severe nearsightedness since early childhood. I have to have specialty contacts ordered because no retail store carries my strength in contacts.  My worst vision was 20/875 and 20/825.  After, a six month mega dose regimen of Maritime Prime Pycnogenol in the late 90's, my eyesight improved at least 100 points in both eyes -as testified to by my eye doctor.  I have had issues which include diabetes, eye infections, corneal abrasions (imagine your eyes being rubbed with rocky sand), recent diagnosis of onset cataracts and other eye conditions of which I do not recall (though very scary).I have taken the softgels and noticed none of the negative side effects reported by some other reviewers such as distasteful odor, taste or repeating.  I have a very sensitive stomach, so if it bothered me, I would notice and report it.I do not see any improvement with my vision from taking this product.  That said, I do take a lot of prescription medication which may impact this product's ability to heal or repair the eyes.  Several of my medications impact the level of fluids in my eyes, nasal passages and create dry mouth.  Since drug manufacturers are much more inclined to report the positives and not the negatives - just look at the number of class action suits against pharmaceutical and medical device companies - then I can't truly ascertain the benefits of this product.I like the Jarrow Formulas line and I may consider continuing this regime for a longer time.
B0013OX9NC Lutein is supposed to be good for the eyes. I'm hoping this will help with some seasonal allergy symptoms  that can cause fuzzy vision and mucus. But this is yet another softgel by Jarrow that downright smells bad! We just got half a dozen different softgel supplements from Jarrow, and virtually ALL of them have a very distinct and unpleasant smell. Yuck! It doesn't encourage me to want to keep taking them or buy again. Clearly it's something in their manufacturing process. Guess I'll just plug my nose and keep downing these smelly things. Do they work? Who knows? I can never tell if supplements are worthwhile. It's been said that Americans have the most expensive urine in the world, from all the over used supplements.  Not sure which side I fall on that, but I do know I'll probably never get smelly softgels made by Jarrow again. Just my 2cents.UPDATE: just found a better quality alternative:Trunature Lutein (25mg) and Zeaxanthin (5mg) Softgels, 120 Count
B0013OX9NC My mom just had cataract surgery on both her eyes and her doctor suggested to her to take Lutein to help maintain good eye health for her.  Before the surgery she couldn't see well past her nose, and after surgery her vision jumped to 20/30 vision.  She's been taking the Lutein and mentioned that the pills are easy to swallow, don't seem to have any side effects, and she's happily enjoying her good vision.  Hopefully these pills will help maintain her good sight - she's enjoying seeing things clearly again!
B0013OX9NC I wanted my boyfriend to try this supplement because he has the dry form of macular degeneration and his eye doctor suggested he take PreserVision (the one he buys does not contain Lutein) and Lutein to ward off any further eye damage.  He's taken PreserVision for 3-4 years but has only been a few weeks on this.  So far he has no side effects from either product.There's Lutein 20mg and Zeaxanthin 1 mg in each softgel. Other ingredients are soybean oil, beeswax and mixed tocopherols.  Each softgel consists of gelatin, glycerin, and water. The softgels contain soy but do not contain, wheat, gluten, dairy, eggs, fish or shellfish, or peanuts or tree nuts. The bottle claims to support visual function and protect the macula. Dosage is one softgel per day with food. From the research I found on WebMD it appears Lutein is absorbed better with a higher fat meal.Being that my boyfriend has had no side effects and this softgel has a decent dosage of Lutein, his doctor recommends Lutein along with PreserVision and studies say that Lutein works, I consider this five stars. Of course, according to WebMD: \"There is 44 mg of lutein per cup of cooked kale, 26 mg/cup of cooked spinach, and 3 mg/cup of broccoli.\"  Therefore, if you ate a cup of kale per day you would get double the dose of what's in one Softgel here.From my perspective, any Lutein supplement that does not cause side effects and has a sufficient dosage I would rate five stars because studies have suggested it is suppose to work.
B0013OX9NC I used to buy from Puritan Pride found these gave them a try work just as good and cheaper will buy again
B0013OX9NC Jarrow's Lutein seems to be an excellent choice for vision benefits. I've taken it for several months, and while the changes are subtle, they're definitely there.My vision seems to be sharper and clearer, and by some miracle, I didn't need a change in my eyeglass prescription for the first time since I got reading glasses.Definitely worth a few bucks to give your vision a boost.
B0013OX9NC I must admit that I like products from this company, because I have had good luck with them. This is another that I would recommend if you are looking to looking to protect or improve your eyesight. I offer that this is has been a good addition to my health regimen that over time has made a slight, but noticeable improvement.
B0013OX9NC I am a 57 year old female and have worn glasses for about 20 years. I am a real estate title examiner and spend a lot of time reading legal documents on top of loving to read a wide variety of books.  In spite of recently getting new glasses I began noticing that I was having trouble focusing on specific words or letters. I guess this is due to me being near sighted in one eye and far sighted in the other eye, but to me it seemed like my eyes were constantly jumping around. Driving at night was also becoming a problem with the glare from headlights. After taking the Lutein for about two weeks I was driving home after dark and was amazed at how clear everything looked and the headlights didn't bother me at all. When I got home I found something to read an noticed that my eyes could now focus on individual letters. I am definitely happy with this product and will continue to purchase it.
B0013OX9NC This is yet another Jarrow product which I have in the house and use everyday. But I don't use it for myself, I use it for my dog. Lutein is an antioxidant which helps the eyes perform well, and keeps them from slowly degrading. Lutein is found in the macula and the lens of the eye as well as breast, cervical and skin tissue. It is naturally found in dark green, leafy vegetables like spinach, collard greens and salad greens, etc. Since these greens are not really a big part of the canine diet, many dogs succumb to an eye disease called Pannus. To help keep my dog's eyes healthy, I give her one softgel a day, along with a few other supplements. It helps a great deal and I'll never stop giving her the best.I'm on a plant based diet so I do get plenty of Lutein from organic fresh foods but if I miss a day of dark green, leafy vegetables, I will use this supplement. Lutein has been known to decrease macular degeneration & cataracts and guard against too much UV radiation sunlight. Lutein and zeaxantin also use their antioxidant abilities to keep us free from free radicals, and may help protect against atherosclerosis (fatty deposits in arteries), which can lead to heart attacks. I like the Jarrow brand and I feel these supplements do wonders. I can highly recommend them for yourselves or your pets.
B0013OX9NC The thing about preventative supplements is that you really won't necessarily see the benefit in terms of a dramatic improvement.  I didn't start on Lutein expecting it to have any noticeable short-term impact on my farsighted/nearsightedness, or those \"floaters\" that are an early indicator for cataracts -- and it hasn't.  The question is more whether a lutein supplements, for me, can forstall or prevent macular degeneration, or whether this little pill is just doing its bit towards making my country's sewage the Most Nutritionally Supplemented Sludge on the Planet.I don't know where I stand on all that, but after reading some study literature, I am having a relative with eye issues ask the doctor about lutein on her next visit.  As for me...I don't have a family history of macular degeneration, so maybe I don't need it, but I have seen some noticeable improvement in my (aging) skin over recent weeks, particularly around the eyes - weird, considering no change in other products I use, and guess what?  A web search on \"Lutein and skin\" uncovers a fair amount of research strongly supporting the notion that Lutein improves skin hydration and elasticity.Obviously this is just personal/anecdotal and I'd be skeptical, too, except for my own experience.  I do have to remember to take this with food, as either it orJarrow Formulas Magmind Nutritional Supplement, 90 Count(which I started at the same time last month) is causing minor nausea on an empty stomach.What I might not have continued for the sake of my eyes, I may end up keeping for the sake of my vanity!
B0013OX9NC Okay, I'm not talking about goggles here I'm talking about softgels.  Very small, easy to swallow, tasteless softgels.I was taking VISION OPTIMIZER BY Jarrow which was helping with my dry, tired eyes but stopped to try this instead.  Jarrow's Lutein formula has 20mg of Lutein, twice the amount found in VISION OPTIMIZER but not much else, as in, 1mg of Zeaxanthin, and that's it.  Now, I've read that Lutein is important for eye health but I don't know how much you need.  Maybe 10mg is enough?  Or, maybe you need 20mg or why else bother.  I don't know.  What I do know is that the extra added ingredients in the VISION OPTIMIZER formula seemed to relieve my dry, tired eyes better than the plain Lutein formula did.That doesn't mean I'm going to stop taking this.  I might end up taking both just to make sure I'm getting enough Lutein to protect my macula and lens.  I'll have to talk to my doctor first.  I just know I want to do everything necessary to protect my vision.
B0013OX9NC These pills aren't too big and should be easy for most folks to swallow. Supplements can be hit or miss, but I've found the Jarrow brand to exhibit quality and be effective for what they are supposed to be used for. My eyes are starting to not work quite as well as they used to, and I feel that taking this Lutein supplement does help or ever reverses that condition. This is all subjective of course, but it has been my experience. Jarrow appears to be a quality brand and I will continue using it.~ Kort
B0013OX9NC I use the Mayo Clinic website to get information about supplements and their effectiveness in treating medical conditions. They say \"lutein and zeaxanthin may...reduce the risk of macular degeneration.\"I also like the Jarrow Formulas brand, and at the current price ($9.09), it's a great deal, especially if you have Amazon Prime. Unlike drugs, supplements generally have little or no side effects. It's always worth giving them a try to see if they help you.
B0013OX9NC Been taking for a month now, once capsule a day. No reactions taken with food or on a empty stomach. I have horrible allergy eyes and I swear these have made a difference. I haven't had a itchy eye attack for over two weeks and with the pets and my allergies I have to believe these are making a difference. In front of a computer 10 hours a day my eyes don't feel as tired either- I will re-order, having great results
B0013OX9NC These are fairly normal sized brown softgel tabs.  They are not shaped like capsules but more like elongated pills, like maybe a small berry - and they are easy to take.  They go down well without dissolving before they get there.  They don't have any bad taste and no aftertaste at all.  It's very easy to take them, and forget them.I noticed recently that I'm having a very hard time seeing smaller and smaller print, and I know that smaller than usual optic nerves anyway, so I thought this would be something I could do to try to preserve my vision.  Lutein is cited in several studies as being a helpful nutrient for the eyes.I've taken it about 3 weeks but can't tell any difference, but also I can't tell that my vision is any worse, which could mean it's working.Amazon has a good price on this compared with other sites I looked at, and Jarrow is a very good brand that I trust and have a lot of positive experiences with.
B0013OX9NC I was diagnosed with early age-related macular degeneration. Of course, I was shocked & horrified. How helpful the optometrist was to sell me a lutein product that would &#34;improve&#34; my AMD and supposedly it did. Because of the high dollar cost of their product, I researched on Amazon for an alternative Lutein product. This product has done an even better job of preserving my eyesight.
B0013OX9NC Jarrow Formulas Lutein Softgels promise health to skin, cervical membranes, eyes.  As I age, I've got 2+ shoe boxes of supplements in my daily regimen.  I have eye problems, bone problems, and cholesterol problems.  I've learned recently that supplements besides the popular ones like calcium, Red Yeast Rice, and Fish Oil can be helpful, and give support as well.  I have a doctor who has recommended that I take less of some of the popular ones, and give others a try.I rarely eat carrots, or leafy, dark vegetables, so these are good.More from Amazon:Amazon.com Product DescriptionLutein is an antioxidant carotenoid that occurs in nature with zeaxanthin; a closely related carotenoid. Lutein and zeaxanthin concentrate in the eye's macula and lens; as well as in the skin; breast and cervical tissues.* Both lutein and zeaxanthin protect the macula from degradation normally associated with aging and oxidative stress.* The macula is responsible for focus and color differentiation. Lutein and zeaxanthin are found in dark green; leafy vegetables. While the average American intake of lutein is only 2 mg per day; other population groups consume up to 20 to 25 mg per day.* Jarrow FORMULAS Lutein is extracted from marigold petals. Each softgel contains 20 mg elemental lutein from lutein esters; which are naturally occurring; more stable and are well absorbed. Keep out of the reach of children.At a Glance:Provides effective levels of the important eye-protecting nutrients lutein and zeaxanthin that must come from dietary intake*Better stability and absorption with naturally occurring lutein estersFor adults of all ages who are concerned about maintaining healthy vision*Provides effective levels of the important eye-protecting nutrients lutein and zeaxanthin.Better stability and absorption with naturally occurring lutein esters.View larger.Two \"Minor\" Carotenoids Provide Major ProtectionJarrow Formulas Lutein is a blend of lutein and zeaxanthin extracted from marigold petals and then purified into crystalline form. These carotenoids (a family of brightly colored pigments in plant foods) are less common than their better-known relative, beta-carotene, but they appear to offer more and greater benefits to the body. In particular, lutein and zeaxanthin have been shown clinically to support visual function and to protect the health of eye tissues as we age.* In addition, preliminary research suggests that lutein and zeaxanthin may support the cardiovascular system and help to maintain normal cell differentiation in the tissues of the breast, cervix, colon and skin.*Healthy VisionScientists believe that lutein and zeaxanthin contribute to the density of macular pigment--the component of the eye which typically absorbs and filters out 40 to 60 percent of damaging near-ultraviolet blue light (near-UV blue light) which strikes the retina. The denser the pigment, the more the inner retina is protected from light-induced damage. Lutein/zeaxanthin also helps limit blue light damage to the inner retina by protecting against lipid peroxidation and by neutralizing free radicals.*Considerable evidence shows the importance of lutein and zeaxanthin in supporting the health of the eye lens as we age.
B0013OX9NC After nearly a half century of better than perfect vision, I finally started having difficulty reading very small script on some bottles (like this one!) last year. It's a very minor thing, but I've always been very grateful for my vision, and as an art and nature lover I sure appreciate the minutiae they constantly reveal, thus I've been trying various foods and supplements to see if they can help. Lutein is among the most common suggestions, so I gave it a try.While I've noticed only a tiny improvement in the astigmatism, I certainly have found that my color perception is stronger. Hues are more complex and there seems to be a little more definition between shades. Blues and reds are also deeper. Is this due to the lutein? Impossible to say 100% yes, as I'm also doing more oil pulling (look it up, very simple, cheap and useful for many health issues) and taking other supplements, so it may be a combinatory effect, but I feel safe in saying that this lutein is making at least some difference in my eyesight. If your eyes are less than perfect, it couldn't hurt to give lutein a try for a month and see what you think, and think about what you see.
B0013OX9NC I've been taking Jarrow Lutein for a couple of weeks, and it seems to be helping some of my vision issues. My vision has been getting blurry, especially early in the morning, and I get eyestrain easily. Since I've been taking this product both conditions seem to be improving. I'll keep taking it for a while to see if things continue to improve, or whether I'm experiencing the \"Hawthorne Effect\" (thinking things are better simply because I'm doing something different).
B0013OX9NC I guess I get enough Lutein in my diet because after a month of using this per the directions I have not noticed any difference in my eye sight.  I need reading glasses and this dietary supplement has not changed that.  I also haven't had any negative effects, just no effects at all.  Maybe I need to use it for a longer period of time, I don't really know.  If you need this type of supplement, then this should be a good choice.  Jarrow is known for quality supplements, these are easy to swallow as the pill is not large at all.
B0013OX9NC I have never had good eyesight, and I have noticed increasing problems as I've aged. I'm concerned enough to take this supplement. Like beta-carotene, lutein (in the form of Marigold petal extract) helps counteract the effects of aging on vision. Furthermore, lutein is an antioxidant and aids in cell growth and repair.One capsule a day makes it possible to get the necessary amount of lutein. The capsules are easy to take and have no aftertaste.
B0013OX9NC I'm still taking this supplement so I don't know the long term results, but my eyes seem a little less tired and sore, after being on the computer all day.
B0013OX9NC I use Lutein for my vision.  It seems to help w
B0013OX9NC The softgel capsules are small and easy to swallow. I have been taking them for over a month now with no adverse effect. Occasionally the fillers in supplements can cause me to experience stomach irritation; no problem with the Jarrows Formula. Another plus, they are reasonably priced and delivered to your door.I have not see any change in my vision, but I was not having any problems to begin with. On the advice of my physician, I have started taking Lutein along with Vitamin A to help prevent the development of macular degeneration. My mom suffers from this disease and it is known to run in families.
B0013OX9NC I've notice a decrease in my vision over the last year. I think it has a lot do with regular aging and looking at the computer screen more often.  For the last month I've started using Jarrow Lutein andHerbal Eyebright Extract - 1 oz - Liquideye wash.  The eye wash worked immediately to clear up my vision.  It felt like it removed a film that was covering my eyes (perhaps the increased blood flow).  And I think that the Lutein is helping to build up my eye health at a deeper level.  I've seen my improved vision stick around these last weeks and I feel that my eyes will only get healthier.
B0013OX9NC I started taking this when I first received it. But after a doctors appointment, my physician instructed me to stop taking them. As a diabetic, she wants me to get my sugar numbers under control first. This is why I'm having trouble with my vision. So until then, to be continued . . . .
B0013OX9NC I have vision issues related to an autoimmune disease.  As of now there is nothing the various specialists I've been to can do for me.All three of the various vision-related doctors I've been to have recommended lutein and/or lutein w/zeaxanthin to help slow my vision loss.I've been trying various brands for the past year and the vision deterioration slowed, but hasn't ceased or gotten better.I tried the Jarrow formulas lutein because I've had good luck with this brand in other supplements.  The softgel is easy to swallow, they smell unpleasant, but aren't intolerable.  I haven't noticed any difference after 30 days with this brand of lutein compared to the others I've tried.  As I haven't had negative side effects I will continue to take this supplement until my doctor says to do otherwise.I've gone back to juicing greens as that has proved to be the best thing I've done for my vision and results are noticeable fairly quickly.
B0013OX9NC What can I say about a supplement?  It works to quiet the flashers in my eyes and the caps are easy to swallow.  I have Amazon ship them to me every 2 months so I don't run out.
B0013OX9NC Jarrow Formulas' lutein is packaged in easy to take 20mg softgels. The science around lutein's value when taken as a supplement to help prevent AMD remains inconclusive, but there are no warnings about side effects when taken in reasonable amounts over long periods. The packaging and promotional script certainly lead one to think that lutein may be a sort of magic bullet, but I remain skeptical after taking it for a week.I would agree that a week in not a sufficient time to see what effect, if any, this supplement will have, so I am remaining neutral regarding any benefits for me at this time. I plan to continue with the remainder of these capsules and will revisit this summary at that time to update any improvements I might experience.I cannot think that anyone with AMD will see any real, rapid improvement, but if this supplement at least conveys some degree of protection, it would be worth integrating into one's regimen as it is not expensive and Jarrow seems to have a good reputation regarding the integrity of its products.Update: It's now been 2 weeks, and so far, no changes in the way my eyes feel or in my vision.Update 2: Well, after a few more weeks of taking this supplement, I can report that nothing has changed. My eyes are no better, there are still tired after a day's work, and this product may have long-term benefits but, for me, there is nothing else to note.
B0013OX9NC This is good product. Getting what you need and what you asked for. Not combined in a multi-supplements where you also get a lot of unnecessary and potentially harmful agents as well.
B0013OX9NC It's easy to swallow.  I cannot tell if it has helped my vision or any of the other physical enhancements the makers say it might do.  I've taken a lot of supplements over the years for various things, but as I can recall, I've never noticed any improvement or extra anything.  But, if doctors are telling their patients to take a Lutein supplement to help macular degeneration or other disorder, then I suspect it will help.
B0013OX9NC I'm getting older, so this seems like a good supplement to help my rapidly declining eyesight.  I like Jarrow products in general, the bottles are not impossible to open, and the capsules and soft gels always arrive intact.  These are easy to swallow, cause no indigestion or other stomach problems, and although I can't say for sure they are improving my eyesight, I feel confident that this antioxidant is  good for my health in general.
B0013OX9NC My eyes were intermittently dry, and getting more so, more frequently. My doctor suggested taking a lutein supplement as a solution. After taking one of the the Jarrow Formulas Lutein 20mg every morning with breakfast, I noticed the problem going away. There was definite improvement after just a few days, and it's so long in between noticing any dryness of my eyes, that I'm sure it will eventually be gone entirely. While it continues to improve I continue taking the Lutein daily as insurance to make sure my body has enough of this to complete its healing process. I am very happy with this product.
B0013OX9NC Over-the-counter supplements don't always contain the amounts  stated on their labels, so I usually check the relevant ConsumerLab report (available online by subscription) before I begin using a new supplement.  CL tests confirm that JARROW LUTEIN does in fact contain the promised 20mg of Lutein and 1mg of Zeaxanthin.  CL also found this Jarrow supplement to be among the lowest-priced (for 10mg of Lutein) of its tested brands.Lutein and Zeaxanthin are thought to reduce the risk of macular degeneration and cataracts, both of which occur more commonly in older people.  Both conditions are treatable, but macular degeneration causes irreversible loss of vision in the central part of a person's field of vision.  If you eat a lot of green leafy vegetables, you probably don't need a Lutein supplement; however most U.S. adults get about 2mg a day from their diet, while adults in other countries get about 20mg.  There isn't any standard \"daily requirement\", but the 20mg in this Jarrow supplement seems to be an average recommended amount.I particularly like supplements sold as softgels, because softgels are easier for me to swallow than compacted pills (or even capsules).  This Jarrow Lutein softgel is rather large (3/8\" wide by 5/8\" long), but it's still easy to swallow.  How well it works, I cannot say, because it's basically a preventive supplement that scientists are still studying.  However, if you want to take a Lutein supplement, this Jarrow product is a good, economical choice.
B0013OX9NC I rely on my eyes for my photography work, so it's a no brainerto take out some extra insurance and keep my vision just as healthyas possible.  Sure, I need glasses, but I've never had problems seeingor driving at night and I want to keep it that way.I believe in the old saying, \"An ounce of prevention is worth a pound ofCure.\"  Especially in this day and age where drugs have so manyside effects.  It's important to keep your health and well being in yourown hands.Great product and I've been using Jarrow for several decades.
B0013OX9NC Started taking Lutein when various problems made getting dark, green, leafy vegetables difficult. The recalls of spinach, romaine lettuce and bagged salads along with the Texas drought had me searching for other sources. This nutrient is essential to avoid the vision stealing macular degeneration that runs in my family. I along with many people need their vision to be independent and taking this supplement helps when the actual sources aren't readily available.
B0013OX9NC I was advised by my eye doctor to take one of these daily when I was diagnosed with macula degeneration in one eye. I bought my first bottle, 30 pills, at Walmart but then discovered that I could actually get twice the amount for the same price at Amazon. I firmly believe that they help my vision (along with the professional treatments I receive). These are NOT a prescription but help with general eye health. Though they are not very expensive it is always nice to find a cheaper price. Who says Walmart can't be beat? Just go and check out Amazon.
B0013OX9NC As you probably know, antioxidants have a variety of benefits (fight free radicals which are the primary cause of cancer, promote cellular health, promote cardiovascular health, etc etc). So the more you get, the better.This Jarrow formula contains a spectrum of antioxidants. And the price is right - at only $4.50 per month (60 softgels for $9). I'm taking it primarily for cardiovascular health, but the extra antioxidants are a great long term \"insurance policy\" to protect against free radicals and other potential problems. I'm definitely adding this to my daily vitamin regiment.
B0013OX9NC I didn't have much hope for this Jarrow Formulas Lutein, because I had a severe allergic reaction to the last vision supplement I took,Jarrow Formulas Vision Optimizer, 90 Capsules(which actually made my eyesight worse).  Thankfully, I never experience any negative reaction to the JF Lutein, and my eyesight started improving after only two weeks.  It wasn't a drastic improvement -- but where I usually have to zoom in when I'm browsing the web four times, I'm now only having to zoom in three times with my browser.  That is something I really didn't expect.  To say the least, I'm thrilled!
B0013OX9NC Lutein and zeaxanthin are carotenoids, important to the functioning of the macular area of the retina of the eye and found especially in green leafy vegetables such as kale. The source for Jarrow Formulas lutein-zeaxanthin supplement is marigold petals; carotenoids are what give these flowers, carrots, and egg yolks their yellow and orange colors. Other ingredients include mixed tocopherols (vitamin E) which are used in various body processes.This supplement seems to be of good quality and the bottle I received has an expiration date of 09/14 which is 20 months from now. It contains 60 opaque gelatin capsules each with 20 mg of lutein and 1 mg of zeaxanthin.  It also contains soybean oil.
B0013OX9NC Sometimes descriptions for products such as Lutein sound too good to be true. I was delighted to find the claims for this product were factual and true beyond my expectations. The label says it \"Supports Visual Function and Protects the Macula.\" Dry and itching eyes have been a problem for me for some time. When the supply arrived, I took the capsule per day as directed. On the third day it occurred to me that I had not had to use eye drops or had any itching at all. It is wonderful to have my eyes feel so good. I shall continue to take the Lutein from now on. I don't know if others will have the same results, but I am extremely pleased with the improvements I have noted to the condition of my eyes. I have already ordered additional supply, and I intend to tell my eye doctor what good results I have had with Lutein..
B0013OX9NC I noticed my vision getting worse in the past few years so when I saw that lutein might help I was eager to try a bottle.  This formula offered by Jarrow contains 20mg of lutein and 1mg of zeaxanthin which may protect the macula from degradation associated with aging.  If you already have dark green, leafy vegetables such as kale in your diet then you may already be getting enough of these two nutrients.  However, the bottle states that the average American intake of lutein is only 2 mg per day and I know that I fall into that category more often than I would like.  I have not experienced any side effects from this formula and I have already felt some improvement in my vision.  I only have to take 1 softgel per day and it is not a large capsule so I am able to get it down easily.
B0013OX9NC Jarrow Formulas Lutein 20mg, 60 Softgelsis a quality supplement.  I generally have the most trouble taking soft-gels.  But these are reasonable in size, about 1/3 the size of larger \"horse pills\" common for fish oil and Omega-3 capsules.  And while the long term effects of taking these is yet to be determined, so far I have had a good experience taking these.I am in my 3rd week of using the product at one capsule per day.  For the first week I took this, I only took it every other day.  After easing it into my diet I have taken one daily with dinner.There are a number of claims associated with this product, as with any supplement or vitamin.  This substance is reported to support visual functioning and protect the macula.  I cannot verify those claims.  In fact, they may not be verifiable.  How does one prove it is not protecting your vision?What I can say is that the pills had a strong odor, almost that of fertile soil.  I was worried that they might be extant, but I have been taking them anyway with no negative consequences.CONCLUSIONJarrow generally makes quality products.  While I can't verify the advertised benefits, I can say that it hasn't done me any harm.  So if you are looking to take a Lutein supplement, this one is well worth considering.  I will update this after longer term use.Enjoy.
B0013OX9NC I am a fan of Jarrow and after reading reviews of their various products I see that others are as well. I like to read and surf online for hours a day. Lately after a few hours the words are blurred and its frustrating. Also this causes me watery and sometimes dry eyes and I googled my symptoms and found that Lutein is helpful with eye site. I found Jarrow Formulas Lutein 20mg, 60 Softgels on Amazon and after using it a month I seldom have blurred vision at the end of the day. This product claims to help several vision problems but it is not Laser surgery and it doesn't claim to be. I am near sided and haven't yet noticed improvement on seeing far away.I can tell you that it does help with my symptoms, tired and blurry vision late in the afternoon/night. I am seldom frustrated with blurry, watery, sometimes dry eyes at the end of the day. I am a believer in natural rememidies and Lutein is made from the marigold flower. I found this quote interesting &#34;Lutein is an antioxidant carotenoid that occurs in nature with zeaxanthin; a closely related carotenoid. Lutein and zeaxanthin concentrate in the eye's macula and lens.....Both lutein and zeaxanthin protect the macula from degradation normally associated with aging and oxidative stress.* The macula is responsible for focus and color differentiation.&#34;I don't usually use quotes in my review, but I found this the best method of describing what I'm trying to say. THIS IS NOT A SNAKEOIL type remedy. I highly recommend Jarrow Formulas Lutein 20 mg if you have any of these symptoms.
B0013OX9NC If one is going to use this combination of supplements to enhance \"eye health\", with the concurrence of an eye care professional, this is an easy product to implement into one's regimen.  They are not too large--the size of typical vitamin E caplets, and covered with the same plasticky coating.  I personally have no problem swallowing them, since they are about one half the size of the usual fish oil 1000 mg. bubble.  While they do cling to the plastic compartment of my pill dish, they do not adhere to the other pills in the dish, nor leak.  I have noticed no aftertaste, and have no idea if they are going to enhance
B0013OX9NC I just finished the bottle today.  I took this twice a day with my eye vitamin for a month.  I didn't notice a difference.I'm going to stick to just the eye vitamin since it was basically the same.  I'm glad I tried extra Lutein.  I was hoping it would make a big difference but it didn't.  It probably is still a good thing to take.
B0013OX9NC I started taking these Lutein softgels after my eye doctor advised me to start taking them. Now, it's not really possible to review the long-term effect of taking them - I'm told that in the long run, these may help your eyesight What I can review: the softgel itself.These softgels aren't overly large - good size, but not massive. They are the size of the average vitamin, but don't have any of the sharp angles that some vitamins have that make them hard to swallow. Instead, these softgels are super smooth and slightly rounded. Finally, there is no unpleasant taste to the coating on the exterior of these softgels.
B0013OX9NC This is a nicely priced Luetin supplement compared to other brands.  I will be buying this item when out of it.
B0013OX9NC Jarrow is a company that I seem to trust. The seemingly high quality of ingredients and wide variety of supplements they produce indicate to me that they are serious about the supplements they produce.I've been taking the Lutein supplement for 30 days and cannot say that my vision has improved in any way that I can discern. However I am confident that the Lutein is beneficial over the longer term for my vision and will help somewhat in slowing or helping to prevent macular degeneration. At least that's my hope.I'm had no ill effects taking this Lutein and it is now part of my daily vitamin ritual.
B0013OX9NC OK I admit I don't eat enough vegetables, but I am allergic to tomatoes, onions make me gassy and greens just taste horribly bitter to me. I decided to try these to supplement my diet and I have to say since I started I have been fealing much better.The eysight benefits would be a bonus, my vision is 20/10 in one eye and 20/80 in the other, so any help would be good.Overall, I think I will keep taking this one.
B0013OX9NC The Jarrow brand, if you are unfamiliar, is well respected in the natural food community. e.g., it's sold at my local organic food co-op. These lutein and zeaxanthin antioxidants may be of particular interest if you are concerned about macular degeneration, and the like.Luteins are no joke. Macular carotenoid researchers are actively exploring up-to-date and evidence-based hypotheses and the supporting research data into the role of the macular carotenoids in age-related macular degeneration (AMD), vision, and cognitive function. You can search on the web for macular carotenoids.
B0013OX9NC I was disappointed for not seeing USP on the label, because this would give me some sense of knowing what is in each supplement. There are too many products that say they are the greatest since slice bread was invented, but they don't have what is listed on the label. I did a test by soaking one softgel in a glass of water for 30 minutes, and I found that the softgel did not dissolve after 30 minutes. I would not recommend this product.
B0013OX9NC I've been using supplements for many years, and am quite familiar with this product space. I have my favorites, based on results.Jarrow lutein is the first lutein supplement I've tried. According to Wikipediea, this particular supplement is \"one of 600 known naturally occurring carotenoids.\" You can get it only from plants.Carotenoids are micronutrients that have implications for eye health and cancer prevention. Some foods that contain them are sweet potatoes (which I consume nearly every day), carrots, and kale (which I consume every day). It's also found in egg yolks, and I consume 5 to 8 dozen eggs (non-factory type) a week (I never engage in the stupidity of discarding the yolk). The rest of my diet is almost completely fruits and vegetables (I do consume brown rice and raw oats).While I've never had my lutein level checked, it is almost certain I don't have a deficiency. Given this, what can I possibly offer regarding my experience with this supplement? I will show you in a moment.First, let's note that the typical American diet is woefully deficient in carotenoids. Look in the typical grocery cart, and this becomes sadly obvious.If you are on a grain-based, rather than green-based, diet you probably have a lutein deficiency (along with other problems, including low testosterone). Supplementing with lutein for a couple of months while you get your diet in order will definitely help your body recover from the effects of the lutein deficiency it's been through.You may not notice any difference, but that doesn't mean there isn't one. Adequate lutein is mostly a preventive thing, as far as I can tell. So the effect you will have by supplementing with lutein is you'll stop ongoing damage in its tracks. The cancer cells that were staying alive longer and longer in your body will die quicker and quicker, rather than morphing into a tumor. Your retinas will stop, and probably reverse, decline that was going on due to lutein deficiency. To protect the precious macula of the eye, you need lutein. Taking this supplemente provides that protection. So, good news there.Since my diet already provides me with more than enough lutein, what can I possibly tell you from trying this supplement from Jarrow? Several things:Product packaging. I lean toward simply returning something that requires the Jaws of Life to open. I do not buy something with the goal of never opening the package it comes in. Jarrow does properly seal the bottle for consumer safety, but they do this intelligently under the assumption the customer might actually want to consume the supplement contained therein.Capsule quality. I've seen capsules that fall apart. This is bad. So I shook the heck out of the Jarrow container. No capsule failure, there. I've also seen capsules so thick that they don't look like they'll ever dissolve. I can pinch these and tell they aren't going to last long in my stomach's acid bath. Interestingly, these are a one-piece capsule rather than a two-piece. I don't know the implications of that for delivery; if you're interested ask a licensed pharmacist.Nausea effect. My major test was to try this with and without food, to see if it made me feel nauseated. Nope. I feel just fine, no matter when I take this.Dosage. If you look on Wikipedia, you'll see a chart showing how much lutein is in certain foods. I regularly eat almost everything on that list, including (in the summer), dandelion leaves (which I pick myself from my own yard). Raw kale (how I eat my kale) gives you 40 mg per 100 gms of kale. That's about 3.5 ounces of kale, which is about what I eat in a day. This supplement provides 20 mg. So, it's a safe dosage.If you are on the typical American diet, you need to replace grain with green. This is a foundational step in personal health care. During the transition phase, while your body is detoxing and nutrient absorption is probably encumbered, add a lutein supplement to your program. This looks like a good one, to me.
B0013OX9NC I love marigolds, they are so sturdy, cheap, easy to grow, and look fantastic in my garden. Despite this I have no intention of eating them!!!! I'm glad Jarrow researchers have done the work for me to extract lutein from the marigolds and package it in a stable formula softgel. I've been taking Lutein for years, and other than slight astigmatism which is caused by an irregularly shaped cornea, my eyes are perfect and bright. This is now my formula of choice to keep my eyes healthy as I get older.
B0013OX9NC I am 55 years old & my eyesight is rapidly deteriorating, so much so That my Dr. recommended this supplement. It is recommended for good eye health by most ophthalmologists. This dosage was a better value that most name brands I've been researching so I figured I would give it a try, although the initial bottle was offered to me from Amazon Vine. I wanted to be sure I selected a brand that I could afford to continue with if it proved effective in a noticeable way.I think my ability to focus has improved a bit, enough so that I'm willing to give it a few more months of use before giving up. I am testing it by seeing what font size I can read without having to use my reading glasses & squint like crazy! I will update in  a few months.There were no negative side effects that I've noticed with this supplement. I take it with food & a large glass of fluids with lunch.
B0013OX9NC These small gel caplets are easy to take and had no bad aftertaste. I only took it a few weeks, but I honestly thing it helped with my eye strain, which had been severe. I'll continue to take it and update this review if I have other benefits from it.
B0013OX9NC I have taken the entire bottle as directed and have found not even the slightest improvement in my vision. Of course, I do not feel that my vision has gotten worse. What is interesting is that a few days after I finished the bottle, I got a terrible headache (for 4 days).....I do not get headaches. I cannot remember when I last had a headache. I can only think that somehow, it was associated with stopping the supplement. Perhaps I should have slowed down when I was running out? I will not be taking these again....that headache was brutal. I now have even more empathy for migraine sufferers!
B0013OX9NC I've had some problems with my left eye over the past year. Now being 20/30, I've grown more interested in taking supplements that could help prevent further problems with my eyesight.I'm not sure if the Lutein has done its job, but I'm been pleased with the product itself. The pill is tiny and easy to take. The instructions on the pill bottle say that you should take it with food, but I didn't feel any stomach discomfort if I didn't take it on a full stomach. I've had issues with many multivitamins in the past that make me fill queasy if I didn't eat enough food, but this wasn't a problem.I like the Lutein product enough to give it a chance after my current supply runs out. The product is easy to take and I hope it delivers the results that it says it does.
B0013OX9NC This supplement is pretty good.  The soft gels are a great size for swallowing and go down easily. I guess they are working, it's always hard to tell for sure, but they seem to be good.
B0013OX9NC My vision began deteriorating 5 years ago. My eyes had trouble focusing. I learned about a natural means of improving my eyesight called \"Bates Method\" and have been practicing ever since (The Bates Method for Better Eyesight Without Glasses). I also learned in another book \"Relearning To See\" about using blinking, shifting, and centralization. By putting the principles from Bates Method and from the book \"Relearning To See\" into practice, my eyesight began to improve over the years.I thought I'd try some lutein supplements since lutein promotes macula health and prevents macula degeneration. The macula is responsible for focusing. I am hopeful that the Jarrow Formulas Lutein will provide the necessary nutrients to the macula to help me further improve my vision.
B0013OX9NC My eye doctor had recommended a Lutein supplement for my eyes/vision problems, then  in my research and talking to my general physician.. She thought it would be a good idea because of my high potential for arthritis.As many people know Lutein is good for maintaining healthy vision as we age, but it also lowers risk factors in getting arthritis and &#34;may&#34; even help with cardiovascular disease.I choose the Jarrow formula because I have used many other products by them and I have come to trust their brand because they have been using more natural ingredients and less fillers than other brands I have looked into.Most of their products have been soft gels,  this product is as well which makes it much easier to digest because I have a relatively weak stomach.In closing my vision has become more comfortable. I feel like I have been straining and squinting a lot less which may have been a placebo affect but my physicians agree that regardless of all that this is still a good supplement to add to my diet.
B0013OX9NC I'm not a doctor. I have no way of doing serious research as to whether these are what they say they are: both chemically whether they are as good a source of Lutein as they claim, and physically whether they really effect my eyes. I have used a number of Jarrow products, though, and feel pretty confident that their formula is a good one. Experientially, too, I have noticed something of a difference fairly quickly after using them.I read a lot and write a lot, and am on the computer for work far more than I'd like to be. I am near-sighted and wear glasses for driving and watching movies and such. When I'm reading, though, I have to take them off. I think that the combination of taking my glasses on and off throughout the day, looking at the screen and at books and at writing a lot of the time, all of that creates a lot of eye strain, and it's noticeable to the point where I have to just close my eyes sometimes for a while in the evening. I've noticed, though, that after taking these for a week or so, I was feeling less eyestrain. I had less blurriness. I could work longer. I can't, for sure, say that it's due to this supplement. Still, it feels noticeable enough that I'm going to keep using it. If you're like me, or for any reason worried about your eyes, it's worth a try.
B0013OX9NC Supplements are a bit of a crap shoot. The designers make something that - on paper - would seem to be healthy for you, but can't guarantee any results. Results are a mystery, sometimes, because you can't exactly hook up your body to a diagnostic machine and say \"Yes, my __________ is operating with a 12% increase in efficiency,\" or \"It appears that my __________ has regenerated back 3% of the mass that I had lost.\" Unless there is some outward physical change or a noticeable boost to metabolism or energy level, the effects of a supplement are almost impossible to discern. Too, the effects of a supplement are not often immediately noticeable. Sometimes you need to take a supplement for an extended period of time before any changes in your body even come about. This product is a mystery to me. I've been taking it for about a month, now, and I can't say that it is doing anything, at all, to my body. As such, I can't really give it a positive rating. If I could tell it was actually doing something positive (or negative) I would be able to write a more informative review, but that just isn't possible at this point in time. If I notice anything different by the time I have consumed the entire bottle, I will come back and relate that. For now, two stars is the best I can give it.
B0013OX9NC It never occured to me that food supplements could do anything for my weakening vision, due to age.  I was sceptical at the claims, but decided that I should take advantage of the chance to try Lutein through Amazon Vine and I'm glad I did.  The improvement isn't exactly marvelous, but it's definitely there and worth the money to continue using.
B0013OX9NC On a routine visit to my eye doctor, he did the test where they dilate your eyes and shine a ray of light (directly from the sun, it would seem) into your eye so they can take a look around.  He pronounced that I have Drusen, which apparently are the first sign of Macular Degeneration.  After I got back up off the floor, I asked what the treatment is for this affliction.  He said basically there is no cure and the best you can do is minimize or delay the effects through diet and supplements with certain vitamins and nutrients.  He recommended switching from regular multi vitamins to a \"silver\" version for \"mature\" adults, adding Fish Oil daily and taking an eye-specific supplement with Lutein.  I stocked up at my local warehouse store and chose Ocuvite with Lutein but figured if a little is good, then more must be better so I threw this Jarrow Formulas Lutein into the mix.  It also contains Zeaxanthin, which was another ingredient in the sample the doctor gave me.  Please note this product does NOT have all the other ingredients of Ocuvite, Preservision etc since they contain Zinc copper and other vitamins.  Make sure Lutein/Zeaxanthin fulfills your doctor's recommendation before choosing this as the only eye supplement you'll take.  I'm taking it in ADDITION to Ocuvite.I haven't noticed nor do I expect any immediate effect from taking this supplement.  Frankly I'll only know if what I'm doing DOESN'T work and even then, it may not be known for years.  In the short haul, I'll say these tablets are an easy to swallow soft gel with no particular taste.  Wish me luck!
B0013OX9NC This product is a supplement for vision. However, after taking this product for a while, the effectiveness does not seem to occur. The tablets look normal in color and they taste pretty fine. It would be better if the manufacturer mentioned about the time it takes to achieve its effect.
B0013OX9NC I broke my glasses a few days ago, so went in for a prescription today for a new pair.  I felt like it was time anyway.  I had also been noticing that my old prescription, from two years ago, didn't feel right anymore, and suspected that my vision had declined and I might need a stronger prescription.The optometrist told me that this is not the case -- that my vision today is actually much better than it was two years ago, and that I needed a weaker prescription, not a stronger one. (This is the reason things had been looking distorted with my old prescription.)She also said that my eyes were focusing much better than they used to, and bringing together the two separate images into one image more effectively. Two years ago, the doctor has prescribed a prism correction, but I no longer need it.I can think of four explanations:1) I take Jarrow lutein every day (three capsules)2) I take astaxanthin every day (three capsules) (also very good for eyesight)3) I've been doing eye exercises.4) I eat organic/free range egg yolks regularly, which are also rich in lutein.There's no way of knowing for sure which is the explanation, or if it's a combination of all of the above.  But I have noticed that when I stop taking lutein (when I run out), in a few days I'll notice that it's harder to read fine print.  When I resuming taking lutein, my vision starts seeming better to me, within a day.  It's a dramatic difference.
B0013OX9NC I really care about my eye health. I read a book or two a week, and have been for many years. Needless to say, reading is very important to me, so my eye health is critical.  I started taking Lutein about a year ago, but only 6mg from a different company.  I have been taking this 20mg. capsule for a couple of weeks and like most supplements, it is difficult to access the effectiveness.I was diagnosed with Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome, which makes my eyes dry in the evening.  Lutein seems to help. I can say, I have had no side effects and the capsule is easy to swallow. I'm giving it 5 stars because Jarrow is a quality manufacturer and the price is excellent.I bet deer have wonderful eyesight because they always eat all my Marigolds!!!
B0013OX9NC I've been taking lutein/zeaxanthin supplements for many years.  These are less expensive than many of the other brands, and seem to work just as well.  I will use this brand again, and will also look at the rest of their product line.
B0013OX9NC Lutein, known as 'the eye vitamin,' isn't a vitamin at all. It is a carotenoid...a powerful antioxidant found in some fruits and vegetables, particularly leafy greens and those that are yellow or orange.  There is considerable evidence that when obtained naturally from diet, it can prevent loss of vision caused by age-related macular degeration, cataracts and retinitis pigmentosa.  It's found in the color pigment in the human eye, in the retina and the macula, where it serves as a light filter, preventing sun damage in the same way that a sunscreen protects the skin.You can forget the old wives' tales, by the way. Carrots are good for vision, but many vegetables are better.  And some cooked carrots are better than raw. The cooking process releases the lutein. Research also indicates that Lutein is absorbed best when taken with a high-fat meal.Researchers at Harvard found that eating 6 mg of lutein each day lowered the odds of developing macular degeneration, a leading cause of blindness in the elderly, by 43 percent. Other studies show that adding sufficient quantities of lutein to your diet can cut your chances of developing cataracts by up to 50 percent. Getting that daily minimum isn't difficult: one cup of cooked spinach will provide 26 mgs.  All of the studies are based on lutein derived from  natural sources, as part of the regular diet.  Whether the same benefits can be accrued from taking Lutein supplements is not proven. But what the heck, it can't hurt.  I have compromised vision in one eye and am not going to risk anything happening to the one that's still in good working order.I did some poking around on the internet and found a list of lutein-rich foods (figures show amounts of Lutein per 100 grams).Nasturtium (yellow flowers, lutein levels only) - 45,000 mgs per 100 gramsNasturtium (leaves only) - 13,600Kale (raw) - 39,550Kale (cooked) - 18,246Dandelion leaves (raw) - 13,610Turnip greens (raw) - 12,825Turnip greens (cooked - 8440Spinach (raw) - 12,198Spinach (cooked) - 11,308Swiss chard (raw or cooked) - 11,000Collard greens (cooked) - 7694Watercress (raw - 5767Green peas (raw - 2593Romaine lettuce - 2312Zucchini - 2125Brussels sprouts - 1590Pistachio nuts - 1205Broccoli - 1121Carrot (cooked) - 687Carrot (raw) - 256Corn- 642Eggs (hard boiled) - 353kiwifruit - 122All of these options are fairly tasty, with the exception, of course, of the zucchini, which should be banned by any civilized society.Because the jury is out on how effective lutein is when taken in the form of a nutriceutical supplement, I can't rate this product in terms of efficacy or results.  But if you comparison shop and do some research, you'll find that the Jarrow products contain appropriate levels of active ingredients, the price is reasonable when compared to similar products with comparable formulas. They are known to provide high quality products using the latest technology. So, until we know for sure whether or not Lutein in capsule form does any good, I'm going to give it five stars. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn't. I'm buying it for insurance purposes...I would rather err on the side of protecting my vision than risk losing what I have left.There is also some speculation that lutein may help prevent colon cancer, breast cancer, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease. More good reasons for eating pistachio nuts and fresh corn! And remember, for best results, the meal should include fat...so be sure to add plenty of butter to your corn on the cob.(Please don't lecture me about how good zucchini is for us. I don't care. It tastes like a damp towel. I won't eat it. However, if you have discovered some some miracle of cooking magic that makes the stuff edible, please share it. But I'm talking good...asparagus good, pumpkin good. Potato good.  Not crookneck squash good, because that stuff is  worse than zucchini.)
B0013OX9NC Well, I've reached the age at which a quarter of people show signs of macular degeneration and that average certainly doesn't improve the older one gets.  Since a daily glass of red wine to prevent this eye condition has been debunked (at least for now), I'm happy to have this lutein/zeaxanthin supplement, which, although not as pleasant to ingest as the wine, is certainly better than 3 cups of collard greens. So I'm happy to have the opportunity to try this brand of the supplement.  It seems to be quite satisfactory but there's really no way for me to know if it works, except by having my eyes checked annually.  So far I've had a clean bill of eye health.
B0013OX9NC One a night for two weeks and my vision has not improved. Maybe I should have bought the combo with Billberry or whatever it's called.
B0013OX9NC I think it is impossible for me to say whether this is helping my eyes or not.  All I can say is that it has caused no problems.  I was taking one each day, but then read on WebMD that \"Even high dietary lutein intake of 6.9-11.7 mg/day appears to be safe. Lutein supplements 10 mg/day for a year have also been safely used.\" and switched to 1 every 2 days as the 20 mg in each softgel pill may be more than I need.I don't take a lot of supplements and only ordered these because WebMD said they are POSSIBLY helpful with:Age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Consuming lutein as part of the diet might help to prevent AMD, but it's not known whether taking lutein supplements works as well. There is also some information that taking lutein supplements (10 mg per day for 12 months) might help decrease symptoms of AMD, but more research is needed. Lutein supplements don't seem to keep AMD from getting worse.Reducing the risk of developing eye cataracts, when high amounts of lutein are obtained from the diet. It is not known if lutein supplements offer the same benefit.Given the low risk and possible benefit, I am glad to be taking these.
B0013OX9NC Ordered this because my doctor said I need to take it for my eyes.  I guess it works.  But I got a better deal at my local drug store.
B0013OX9NC I have nothing bad to say about Jarrow Lutein. I've found that it seems to work just as well as I would have expected, and there is no bad taste/aftertaste from the pill going down. It's easy to swallow, and the Jarrow brand seems reasonably priced (not the cheapest, but right about in the middle of the pack). As far as effectiveness, I've only been using it a few weeks now and I'm not going to say I've seen a drastic improvement in my eye health or vision, but I have no complaints and certainly haven't experienced anything bad from using it. Overall I can recommend this product as a seemingly solid Lutein supplement.
B0013OX9NC My ophthalmologist recommended that I take lutein for my eyesight. As I grow older my eyesight gets progressively worse. Lutein is meant to support good cell growth and slow the effects of aging on the eyes.  I hope it works but just using it for a short time so far it's impossible to tell. I can say that the pill is small and easy to swallow and I've had no side effects.
B0013OX9NC Eyes need lutein, an antioxidant compound found in tomatoes and other vegetables.  So enjoy tomatoes in your salads -- except that tomatoes grown in poor soil and under less than optimal conditions may not have enough lutein to do the job.  That's when a supplement such as this by Jarrow can help.  The fact that a small amount of zeaxanthin is also included is a bonus to protect your eyes.I've been using Jarrow supplements for about a year, and have found them to be helpful and have also found that their lists of ingredients appear to be accurate representations of what's actually in their capsules. I recommend considering products from Jarrow before going to those of other companies.
B0013OX9NC Macular Degeneration runs in my family so my doctor recommended that I take Lutein supplements to try to avoid the same issues.  These are very easy to take with no bad odors or unpleasant aftertaste.  They are not too big to swallow and do not cause any side effects.  I have found Jarrow to be a reputable manufacturer of supplements and their prices are usually quite fair.  Quality is consistent and superior to many higher cost brands.
B0013OX9NC I'll say right off the bat: I don't notice much, if any, difference by taking these. But I do trust the research, which says that lutein is very good for your eyes. So I take them regularly. I haven't noticed any adverse effects, and perhaps over time they will have a positive effect on my eyes.
B0013OX9NC I've used the Jarrow Vision Optimizer that boasts more ingredients:- Vitamin C, E, niacinamide, B1, B2, B6, Selenium, Taurine, Quercetin, Blackcurrant Extract, Alpha Lipoic Acid, Gamma Tocopherol, Grape Seed Extract, Eyebright, Ginkgo Biloba, Lutein, Zeaxanthin.It might appear that the Vision Optimizer is better than this one (the Lutein and Zeaxanthin), but oh, there's something to consider before letting judgement fall.  The Vision Optimizer capsules are big and harder to swallow, and the serving size is 3 of the capsules per day!Also, the Vision Optimizer has only 10mg of Lutein and 2 mg of Zeaxanthin.This Jarrow Formula, has 20mg of Lutein and 1mg of Zeaxanthin and the capsules are much easier to swallow and the service size is only one.So, if you need more Lutein, this is the one. If you don't like large capsules, this is the one.If you want a more comprehensive protocol, the vision optimizer has a wider range of ingredients that are believed to help the eyes in many ways.
B0013OX9NC This Lutein supplement is a great addition to a healthy diet: taken once a day with water, this is helpful for improvements in skin, eyes, and other tissues...decent price, good product, would recommend!
B0013OX9NC My eyes/vision used to feel &#34;just not right&#34; until I started taking this product. After about 2 weeks of starting with this product, my eyes don't bother me any more. The way I can tell is that I'm no longer thinking about my eyes / vision a hundred times a day! These days I forget that I sued to have an issue with my eyes. In addition to this product, I also use eye drops (lubricant) once a day.I have good vision but since turning 50, I have started using reading glasses.
B0013OX9NC I really do not know how this works, though research says it does. However, if you get Lutein, make sure it comes with a mix of Zeaxanthin. The two together apparently bond together to provide what our eyes need to grow stronger. As I said, I cannot see a difference yet, but I'm only 1/3rd through the bottle. I'm hoping it does something useful.I will come back to review this again, once I have completed the bottle.
B0013OX9NC When I take this Jarrow Formulas Lutein.  I can see better and my vision got clear.  When I forgot to take it one day or two...my vision get blurry....Then I took it and got clear in few hours.  I guess Lutein is very essential for our retina.
B0013OX9NC These  are easy to take with no unpleasant taste or aftertaste.  I believe that Lutein helps eye health - the evidence is pretty overhwelming.After 2 weeks, I haven't personally experience any improvement in my eyestrain/blurriness.  I was hoping for some improvement to the blurriness that sets in after I've been staring at a computer screen for too long.So maybe 3 stars for Lutein, but 5 stars for this supplement if you already know that Lutein does work for you.I will continue to take these because I believe the medical literature that it's good for my eyes, even if not for the specific blurriness issue.
B0013OX9NC It is a small palatable pill and rather easy to take.  As for whether it is useful for my eyes, I could assume Lutein is good and hope that this is working.  I doubt that the effect could be felt in a short period of time. I will give this a try and see if I can see better.
B0013OX9NC My eye guy recommended that I take Lutein, and use a supplement that has at lease 10 mg of Lutein. This has twice that, plus you get 60 softgels. Plus it's under $10, so it's less expensive and has twice the active ingredient than other brands. It's also a small softgel, so is easy to swallow.
B0013OX9NC From time to time, I have taken supplements to help my vision.  I want to try to prevent my eyesight from getting any worse so I am open to trying what the FDA doesn't want you to know it works.  A few months ago my eyes would get tried after the long work days so I was thinking of getting something for my eyes again as I do not want to get a new pair of glasses yet.  I tried these and my vision is doing well, even after a long day.  While I cannot say these helped for certain, I am glad my eyes are doing a little better.
B0013OX9NC My relatives have serious vision issues as they age including glaucoma & macular degeneration. My own eye exams include the higher $ retinal imaging record as a preventative detection measure. Since lutein has been in my regimen for yours, the retinal images have been unchanged for the good or diagnosed as better.Improved absorption of lutein through more current technology is all good.
B0013OX9NC I'm in my 40's and I work on the computer for hours and hours.Recently, my eyes started getting terribly tired in the evening.  It was hard to focus and my night vision while driving seemed to be compromised.  I had an eye exam and my doctor said my eyes were in great shape.  He said some of his other patients were taking Lutien and why not give it a try...Well, I've been taking Lutein for several weeks and it HAS helped!  My focusing is better and things are so much less blurry towards the end of the day.  At night, my eyes are much less tired.  I am surprised and happy to have such a great response.  Placebo?  Maybe.  But, I'm not stopping these to test it out.  They have really made a big difference for me and I'm very pleased to be able to see more clearly and with less strain.
B0013OX9NC I did my homework when I decided on adding a Lutein supplement. I've been taking Jarrow's Lutein formula for over a year now. And I can tell that it helps my eyes because they get worse when I forget to take it! I trust this brand for purity - something you have to check out with vitamin companies.Important: The softgel has a great shape that goes down easy with no aftertaste.Take it and be healthy!
B0013OX9NC I tried these because they worked for my Dad. He swears they help with his near sightedness. So far I have not seen a change in my own vision or eye health though. Fortunately, I have not experienced any side effects from these either. Since they are easy to swallow and cause no ill effects, I'm going to try them for another month or two to determine if this is the type of supplement that must be taken for awhile before having an effect. Also, my ophthalmologist recommends this supplement.
B0013OX9NC i take lutein for eye health- jarrow is a good brand that i trust.  this lutein was at a good price and i believe it is a quality product.
B0013OX9NC Population studies link low levels of lutein and Zeaxanthin to higher incidence of macular degeneration. But the proof of lutein and Zeaxanthin supplements preventing macular degeneration is weak. Since you have only one life, and there are no other means with solid evidence to prevent macular degeneration, I would take these supplements if there is a family history of macular degeneration.Supplement industry, with its powerful lobbying, has managed to prevent its regulation by FDA and so I am always leary of taking supplements and when I do, I only stick to well known brands like Meijer, Costco, Walmart, etc trusting that they have interest in the quality control of what they put on their shelves.Jarrow makes lot of supplements and there is no way for me to personally determine the quality and purity of their supplements. Meijer brand of Lutein has 25 mg lutein and 5 mg of Zeaxanthin compared to 20 mg and 1 mg respectively in Jarrow brand, which as of the date of this review, is half the price per softgel compared with Meijer brand. Jarrow has 60 softgels per bottle (15 cents/softgel) compared to Meijer's 30 per bottle.So if cost is a priority, then this is a good deal. But quality is unknown. On Jarrow web site, I saw no proof of their quality control.
B0013OX9NC Lutein has numerous benefits for your vision. These softgels are the best around in price per mg and a way better bargain that what you will find in Wal-Mart or drug stores. If you're in the market for lutein this is a good option.
B0013OX9NC If you read the information on the bottle this supplement comes in, it tells you that it is not designed to cure, treat, or prevent any disease, though it does talk about how its active ingredient supports tissue in the eye, uterus and other areas. When you decide to start taking any supplement, it's important to know that you are essentially gambling your money on a potential benefit rather than receiving a guarantee. Chances are you can never know if taking such a supplement will assist in health maintenance. My feeling is that, if you are at substantial risk of diseases associated with the tissues such supplements are supposed to support, it may not be a bad gamble to take them. This is why I obtained this supplement.My family has a history of uterine and cervical cancer as well as cataracts. Though I do eat a well-balanced diet which includes food rich in Lutein (broccoli, spinach, eggs with yolks), I figure that with my family's history, a little extra can't hurt and might help. At a price of $9 for nearly a two month supply, this is a pretty economical supplement and it is easy to take. The gel caps are moderate in size and can be taken with food.No one can promise that any supplement is going to perform in a particular way for you, but if you have a family history of any of the problems Lutein might assist the prevention of (macular degeneration, cataracts, etc.) and especially if your diet is lacking, this may be a good option as a supplement for you.
B0013OX9NC I have to admit, I prefer Jarrow products over other brands. They're of excellent quality at a reasonable price, making them one of the best values in nutritional supplements around. The 20mg Lutein softgels are easy to swallow and don't have any odd odors or lingering flavors. They're easy to take and don't upset my somewhat sensitive stomach, even if taken on an empty stomach. If you're looking for a Lutein supplement to help keep your eyes healthy, Jarrow Formulas comes highly recommended.
B0013OX9NC I like the convenience and price of having these Lutein auto-shipped every other month. I take one daily for eye health but found remembering to get them and finding a reasonably price 20mg formula a hassle. Very happy with having them automatically show up every sixty days and getting a discounted price is great.
B0013OX9NC This spring I have been suffering with seasonal allergies that have been worse than usual, especially with my eyes being watery. After a bout this year with a horrible sinus infection brought on by allergies, that even after antibiotics hasn't completely went away, I've been taking vitamins more. Since my own personal diet lacks in the area of not enough dark, green and leafy vegetables and I have a job that keeps me indoors over 12 hours a day, vitamin therapy has been helping.After just one week of taking this Lutein once a day, I can tell the difference in my eyesight and the noticeably reduction in eye watering and eye fatigue.These vitamins are not hard to take for me, and usually I have trouble swallowing pills. They have almost like a softcoat on them which makes them easier to take.Overall, I'd highly recommend these to maintain the health of your eyes, especially if your diet lacks in green, leafy vegetables.
B0013OX9NC If age-related macular degeneration (AMD) runs in your family, especially late onset AMD, please consider this supplement.I first heard about it in various AMD publications years ago, that I poured over when a dear friend became legally blind due to it.Studies have shown that it to be beneficial, so many studies that there was a study to study the studies!!! If memory serves, it was the University of Beijing, but I could be wrong. In any case, the data from a number of studies was examined, along with carefully analyzing if the study has valid data, and it determined that there was a significant benefit for AMD.A minimum of 6-10 mg per day of lutein is suggested, I've been dropping a Jarrow softgel 20mg in a Vitamix smoothie that I share with my spouse.If you don't like kale, which has one of the highest concentrations per serving of Luiein and zeaxanthin, please consider a supplement.
B0013OX9NC I bought this to help with my night blindness.. I dreaded driving at night and would not if I could help it because the bright glare of headlights literally blinded me and so did the reflection of my lights on roadsigns and it scared the hell out of me. I even tried those yellow sunglasses for night driving but they did not help. I am 48 and thought I was going to have to have cornea surgery like my mom but I have no insurance :(. So I googled supplements to help with night blindness/vision problems and this came up.I talked to my dad who is 74 and he said take this it works and that he has been taking it for 20 yrs and has perfect vision.. So I bought this and took 2 on Monday, took 2 on Tuesday and one Wednesday morning on my way out the door at 4am for work for my dreaded 26 mile drive to work in the dark...And as I was driving I slowly realized that the glare of my headlights on the roadsigns did not bother me and that the headlights of other cars did glare at me and i did not have to turn my mirrors like I usually did to try to avoid the lights. As I drove in the dark to work I thought OMG I can flippin see!  lol  The bright glare of lights were no longer blinding me..This cured my night vision problems and cured them fast. Amazing, just amazing...It is so nice to be able to see to drive at night again liki when i was in my 20 and 30s..I will take this for the rest of my life
B0013OX9NC I really like this brand, the bonus is also that the pill is small to take and easy to swallow. After taking these for 2 weeks, I have not noticed a difference. Not sure if I need to take the whole bottle? It can't be harmful so I will keep taking, and possibly order another hoping to see improvement.
B0013OX9NC The product is excellent for eye health. Lutein and Zexanthin is great for promoting eye health. So, this is a good source for those two important vitamins.But, I wished I had read the ingredients list closer, because this product DOES contain soy. If you have a sensitivity to soy, like I do, then you'll want to avoid this product.
B0013OX9NC There is no improved vision here, but after a few days, eyes are significantly less tired after lots of computer time, so it is enough benefit for me. Will keep buying for sure.
B0013OX9NC For those of us over 50 the first line of defense against macula degradation is having your eyes checked every two years (your doctor will probably suggest every year). They have a machine that looks in your eye and gives a colorful display that tells the doctor any signs or concerns. Once my doctor said we should keep an eye on it but two years later he said it hasn't changed and I look ok for now. So while I am not off the hook it appears I won't have problems for a while. And while there is no gaurantee taking a few supplements like this one may help prevent that test from getting any worse.
B0013OX9NC My Dad has emasculate degeneration (hope I spelled that right) and so I am concerned about inheriting that gene.  Figured after seeing this on Dr. Oz to give it a try and after two weeks noticed a big improvement in the clarity of my vision.  I'd definitely recommend this produce.
B0013OX9NC I have no complaints about this product. The capsules are easy to swallow, and I've had no adverse effects from taking them. But neither have I noticed any positive effects attributable to taking the supplement.When I try a new supplement, I like to have a specific goal in mind. Dry eyes have become a serious problem for me, and I'd heard that lutein supplements could help alleviate the problem. I've been taking this product for about a month now, and so far, no luck with relieving dry eyes. I'll keep taking it till the bottle is gone, but I'm not likely to purchase more.With nutritional supplements that promise to prevent future problems, you just have to take it on faith that you're reaping the benefits. There seems to be a lot of well-documented literature about the benefits of lutein and zeaxanthin to promote eye health and prevent macular degeneration. All I know for sure is that it doesn't help with dry eyes.If you've studied the claims and you believe lutein will help you, this product is likely to be satisfactory for you. The only exception would be if you're averse to using a product with soybean oil that is not specified as non-GMO.
B0013OX9NC I am doubtful of a lot of supplements that state they do this or that, especially when the company can't back up their claims with scientific proof.  Lutein supplements are the real deal.  Twelve years ago I got Lasik eye surgery; my eyesight was 20/200 in one eye; 20/400 in the other.  Lasik perfected my vision to 20/20.  I've been taking Lutein ever since and my eyesight has remained perfect, at age 62.  Of course, I can't claim Lutein was solely responsible, but I think it had a lot to do with this.  I like this particular brand because you only have to take one softgel that's easy to swallow once a day.  I received this product courtesy of Amazon Vine.
B0013OX9NC After having a bad experience with the new age fad of sungazing, I found lutein to be effective in getting my vision back to normal. Beforehand, I was starting to have trouble reading bookprint of whatever size for any length of time. Thanks to lutein, my vision has improved so it is not blurry anymore. Jarrow makes a quality form of lutein.
B0013OX9NC I cannot vouch for the effectiveness of this item as the Vine program now insists items be reviewed within 30 days, but I'm happy with the product. There's no way to determine if it has or will benefit my eyesight or anything else in less than 4 weeks. I've tried several Jarrow products and do generally recommend them.
B0013OX9NC We use a zeaxathin product from Life ExtensionLife Extension Super Zeaxanthin with Lutein and Meso Zeaxanthin Plus Astaxanthin and C3g, 60 Softgel,as a part of a health program for vision support, so I thought I'd give the Jarrow Brand a try since it was available to us to try as a part of the Amazon Vine program.I like Jarrow Formulas, as I tend to do well with this brand because of the purity. This product has:No wheat, no gluten, no dairy, no egg, no fish/shellfish, no peanuts/tree nuts. It does contain soy.While it's a good product, after comparing the ingredients with the Life Extension Zeaxanthin, we plan to stick with the Life Extension product. It's got a greater concentration of zeaxanthin from two different sources, a greater concentration of lutein, and C3G that helps support night vision.So this one is fine, but not our first choice.
B0013OX9NC I don't think you can go wrong with Jarrow.If they offer a supplement, it works as described.I have tried many (20+) Jarrow products and I have yet to be disappointed.Give Jarrow a try.This supplement really works.Jarrow formulas are worth it.They come from top quality sources and they are and work exactly as described.
B0013OX9NC I take various supplements every day, and this is one of them. Based on research studies, which I summarize below, I added lutein to my plan. Lutein ia a naturally occurring carotenoid. It is found in green leafy vegetables such as spinach and kale, and also in eggs and animal fat. Lutein is utilized by our bodies as an antioxidant and for blue light absorption.It potentially helps protect our eyes from damage caused by unstable atoms known as free radicals, which can interact with and break down healthy tissue. Lutein may also help to protect our eyes by filtering high-energy blue light. By filtering blue light, the pigment protects underlying cell layers from potential light damage.Also, oral or topical lutein improves skin hydration, elasticity and lipid content.Other research has found lutein can inhibit the thickening of the walls of carotid arteries and LDL-induced plaque on human artery cell walls. Therefore, it is suggested that lutein has strong cardivascular properties.One of the largest case-controlled studies has shown that high intake of lutein from fruits and vegetables significantly reduces the risk of melanoma. Scientists believe these xanthophyll carotenoids prevent melanoma by protecting the skin against sun damage. Korean researchers have found that carotenoids such as lutein and can reduce colon cancer growths. It is currently being studied for breast cancer inhibition.
B0013OX9NC I am not one to believe all the hype about something, and while I wholeheartedly believe in natural foods and  proper supplements made from beneficial botanicals, I know they take time to work. This is why I am in disbelief about how quickly the Jarrow Lutein worked! I (for the last year or so) have used magnified readers when using the computer for long hours, or reading smaller fonts in books or in poorly lit situations. I resigned myself to this new, middle-aged need, begrudgingly.Was I surprised, when in less than a week of use, I did not need to put my glasses on to work. I remembered to get them out of my desk drawer (habit) and never remembered to put them on because I just started working at the computer. No strain, no headache, after hours and hours!
B0013OX9NC I've started taking eye vitamins, even though I'm not sure if they are truly beneficial or not.  I am assuming they are, and these Jarrow ones are very easy to swallow and are nicely priced.  Eye vitamins in the grocery store and drug store cost a lot more.  In fact, they are some of the most expensive vitamins out there!
B0013OX9NC Not sure what I could update here after finishing the first bottle.8 more words required but I have nothing to add.Will update later.
B0013OX9NC At the insistence of my mother, who began taking Ocuvite about 8 yearsago and has excellent eye health in spite of a family history ofcataracts, I recently started taking eye supplements. Initially I wasput off by the cost of Ocuvite, especially since it only had 5mgLutein and 1 mg Zeaxanthin, plus contained other supplements (like VitA & C) that I was already getting. Instead, I started with a storebrand combination gel tab - Simply Right's Lutein 25mg & Zeaxanthin5mg.I'm glad that I had an opportunity to try this Jarrow brand as part ofthe Amazon Vine program, but I plan to go back to my store brand assoon as this bottle is finished. There are a few reasons:(1) PRICE. I get more for my money with the store brand. My storebrand has 120 gel tabs per bottle and costs less than 60 gel tabbottle of this Jarrow brand. Moreover, my store brand contains 25 mgLutein and 5 mg Zeaxanthin, whereas this Jarrow brand contains less ofboth - 20 mg Lutein and 1 mg Zeaxanthin.(2) GEL TABLET SIZE. My store brand's tabs are smaller. This actuallywas a surprise, since there are less active ingredients (mg's) in theJarrow brand. This leads me to suspect that the Jarrow brand containsmore filler & suspension oil. In addition, the Jarrow brand usessoybean oil, which I have been advised to avoid.(3) RATIO OF LUTEIN TO ZEAXANTHIN. My store brand has a lower ratio ofLutein to Zeaxanthin. Lutein & Zeaxanthin appear together in natureand are used in combination in eye supplements. Ocuvite and my storebrand have a 5:1 ratio, whereas this Jarrow brand has a 20:1 ratio.Although higher ratios occur in nature, many eye specialists arerecommend lower ratios in supplements.(4) AMOUNT OF LUTEIN & ZEAXANTHIN. My store brand has more Lutein andZeaxanthin per tab. Zeaxanthin is especially important for the centerof the the macula. As a result, many recommend higher levels ofZeaxanthin. For instance, the American Optometric Association recentlyreported on scientific evidence that suggests 2mg of Zeaxanthin dailyis needed for eye health. This Jarrow brand has only 1mg ofZeaxanthin, and my daily diet does contain the other 1mg.For all these reasons, the Jarrow brand of this supplement is gettinga middle rating from me, and I am going back to my store brand whenthis bottle is finished. I tried it, and I have no reason to doubtthat it's doing what it's supposed. Based on the research I've done, Icertainly don't think it's the best supplement on the market. However,I also don't think it is the worst. Not taking anything, for instance,would be worse.The American diet is deficient in Lutein and Zeaxanthin, so it isimportant to care for our eyes and to supplement our diet asnecessary. However, I'd encourage everyone to do their own research bycomparing ingredients and prices, even seeking out the advice of aphysician, before committing to a particular brand for the long-term.Moreover, shoppers also should also be aware what eye supplements areintended to do. Specifically, Lutein & Zeaxanthin will not restorelost vision, change visual acuity, or correct dry eyes. Instead,Lutein & Zeaxanthin help protect against eye disease, includingmacular degeneration and cataracts. There are excellent medicalresources available at Web MD and the American Optometric Association.Do your own research. Talk to your doctor.
B0013OX9NC My husband and I have been taking Jarrow's Lutein for the last several weeks.  These softgels contain 20 mgs of Lutein and 1 mg of Zeaxanthin.  The floaters my husbands has in his eyes seem to be getting better.  In terms of protecting the macula I assume this is a product that needs to be taken long term to prevent macular degeneration as an older adult.  The cost if used daily  (as sold by Amazon) is $.15 per pill.  Bausch and Lomb advertises a Lutein/Zexanthin/Omega-3 version of Occuvite on television though I have not yet been able to find that triple supplement combination online.  This product is easy to swallow and has no aftertaste or other ill effects at least in our family.
B0013OX9NC My husband has been taking Lutein for years now since finding out it was supposed to be good for eye health.  He is very near sighted and had a detached retina in one eye, so he does anything he can do to keep his vision from getting worse.  He normally takes 40mg a day, so this bottle of 20mg, 60 softgels will last him a couple weeks.I don't believe that this product is something that will improve vision short-term; it needs to be taken continually.  With age, lutein in the eye diminishes and need to be replenished.Jarrow Forumulas seems to be a good product and the price seems good, especially with the subscribe and save.
B0013OX9NC Lutein (and Zeaxanthin) are medically known and with much evidence shown to reduce the risk of AMD (Age-related Muscular Degeneration) and cataract.Due to this reason, I have been keeping my daily intake of vegetables (with Lutein) at about 10-20 mg per day. This has also been a recommended intake for both eye and health benefits as Lutein is a powerful anti-oxidant.However, when we travel, vegetables tend to be a neglected dish and we are glad that with the Jarrow Formulas Lutein softgels, we are able to supplement it to our diet.The pill is medium-sized, has a slight odor and is easy to swallow. One pill carries 20mg Lutein and 1mg Zeaxanthin. A good product to bring during travels or as regular intake to supplement a high protein/low veggie diet.
B0013OX9NC For the last year and a half, I've been concentrating on doing everything I can to prevent my eyesight from deteriorating further. Lutein with Zeaxanthin is one of the basic components of my plan. Although I also take other products, I alternate the rest from day to day. Lutein is the only one I take everyday and I credit the majority of my improvement to this product.The Jarrow formula has the same proportion of the two ingredients that is found in nature when everything is working right. It is a small, easy to swallow capsule, no smell, no aftertaste, and it works. It is also safe, no side effects at even more than this concentration, and no drug interactions.I am obviously doing something right. In the 18-month period, I've had three sets of eyeglasses: the ones I had before I had to start taking prednisone every day. My eyesight was noticeably affected pretty soon after starting and the eyeglass prescription that had been almost unchanged for years became almost useless. I had to get new ones made that were a much stronger prescription. After my latest checkup, those were too strong, and I am almost (not quite, but close) to my old prescription.In addition to this Lutein/Zeaxanthin product, I also take bilberry, choline (a B vitamin) and, twice a week, beta carotene and the AREDS formula. (Note: the last two I take with restraint because both vitamins A & E can have side effects in excess and I'm uncomfortable taking 500% or more of something on a daily basis).My eyesight has, not only not deteriorated further, which was what I'd hoped for, it is almost back to where it was before. I am very happy and relieved, and I am going to continue doing exactly what I've been doing.
B0013OX9NC I was diagnosed with macular degeneration several years ago. I immediately started taking lutein (from various providers) and it seems to me there's been no significant deterioration in my eyesight, which leads me to believe it is beneficial. Of course, this is all so subjective. There's absolutely no way for me to know this definitively.The Jarrow Lutein compares favorably with other brands I've taken, and the price is comparable to what I usually purchase from Sam's Club or Costco.
B0013OX9NC The softgels, to me, are easy to swallow.  This product contains 20 mg of Lutein, which is more than some of the other brands, but also less than some.  Be sure to read the labels before making your purchase to find out the desired milligrams vs. price.
B0013OX9NC Almost ten years ago, my father lost his vision to Rapid, Wet Macular Degeneration.  He did all the right things.  He went to the best Ophthalmologists in our area.  But, unfortunately, he was one of the small percentage of people whose progression can not be stopped, even with the right treatment.  I learned through his diagnosis and treatment that Macular Degeneration is highly genetic.  Even though I was only about 40-years-old at the time, I started to take a much more educated and pro-active role in my eye care.  My own Ophthalmologist recommended that I begin taking supplements which contain Lutein to support my eye health.  For the past ten years, I have been taking a well-known eye care supplement brand; but I have always been bothered by the fact it contains other supplements which I already take for other conditions.  I have always felt I was taking more of certain supplements than I could ever benefit from.  Then, I found Jarrow Formulas Lutein.  It contains only the supplement I really need for my eye care, and not other supplements which I am already taking in other forms.  This is just what I have been looking for!  Thank you, Jarrow Formulas!
B0013OX9NC We tried the Jarrow Lutein 20mg, and there it is a fine quality product. Jarrow is known for its quality ingredients. The reason we aren't giving this 5 stars is that the increased dosage doesn't seem worth it. We normally take a lower dose (and therefore less expensive) and there is no noticeable difference in taking these. So I'd be hard pressed to say: \"spend extra for the higher dose\". But if you are new to Lutein, and can find these at a good price, by all means use them.
B0013OX9NC I have used several and still use Jarrow products. I seem to have had an allergic reaction to the Jarrow Formulas Lutein. This product is made from Marigold petals. My reaction was tightness in the lungs, small hives on my neck and swollen and sore joints in my hands after taking the recommended dosage for 4 days. I am not going to be too quick to blame this product, but every indication leads me to the Lutein. It could have been coincidence, some other external cause or this product. I take several vitamins, minerals and other food supplements including some from Jarrow. I have never had a problem with them and have taken them for from 3 months to several years. All things seemed to be the same except the addition of Lutein. I stopped taking the Lutein after 4 days, and 2 days later all symptoms were gone. Since everyone has different reactions to the same foods, etc. each must judge for oneself.
B0013OX9NC After my left retina detached I learned about vitamins that promote good eye health. Lutein is perhaps the most important. We have used Jarrow before for other supplements and trust the brand. I am hoping to prevent a future detachment by taking lutein daily.
B0013OX9NC I have been reading a lot about Lutein supplementation and have been interested in trying it for a long time. My sensitive stomach issues, however, always prohibited my decision to purchase.  I have been pleasantly surprised by these softgels.  I do not experience an upset stomach or heartburn as I have with many other supplements.  This is a very big deal to me.I believe it will take quite a while to fully realize the potential benefit of taking Lutein, but I'm willing to stick with these Jarrow softgels over the long haul. (Subscribe and Save is definitely the way to go.) The company has an excellent reputation and wide range of products, though the brand has proven impossible to find in stores - at least in my area.Like all supplements, some will notice a difference and some will not. (You can say the same with a lot of prescriptive meds as well.) Overall health, lifestyle choices (activity level, nutrition, etc.), age, and compliance with suggested daily use will all play a role the outcome.
B0013OX9NC Approaching age 60, and suffering from common deteriorating eye performance, this supplement is right up my alley.  After a little over a week, I think I am already seeing some improvement in reading performance and night vision.  The long term benefit is pretty widely accepted on this stuff.The lutein in the Jarrow Formulas supplement is extracted from marigold petals, and purportedly supplements the body as an antioxidant, acting in much the same manner as spinach (an excellent vegetable choice).  Lutein specifically combats aging and degeneration of the macula (delicate light/color sensing area in the rear wall of the eye).  As a general tissue health enhancer, lutein is also believed to enhance cardio and skin health and complex tissues such as cervical and breast tissue.Each medium size and easy to swallow Jarrow's softgel contains 20mg lutein.  Recommended dosage, one per day.Contains no gluten, nuts, dairy, shellfish.  Interestingly . . . I have gotten used to always seeing a boilerplate warning on Jarrow Formulas supplements containers warning pregnant women, people under medication, etc.  However, there is no warning of any kind on this container.Jarrow has an excellent reputation.  Lutein has widely recognized benefit and this deserves to be a key item on my vitamin shelf.
B0013OX9NC In just 3 days I saw an improvement in my eyesight.  It also helped my dry eye syndrome.  Good purchase, and I have recommended it to a friend of mine for her eye problems.
B0013OX9NC My doctor actually recommended I try something for my eyes, so when this came up I felt it might be good. It seems to take the blur from my vision some, which is a good thing considering. For a while i had a lot of trouble with my nightsight and thought it was an issue of my vision getting worse or me getting older. Now I'm thinking it might be correctable and am thinking of starting to use these more regularly.
B0013OX9NC Lutein is one of those supplements which can't be accurately quantified in an informal way since it's a preventive nutrient. The claims for it suggest that it maintains eye health and promotes good cell regulation.  Thus, if you don't get cancer or suffer macular or retinal issues while taking it, it might be the lutein and then again it might be that you just aren't getting any of those things. Bottom line here is that anyone with a health problem that might lead to one of the things that lutein is supposed to prevent, might want to consider taking a lutein supplement.  I take it because I'm diabetic and eye health is a real issue for us.The Jarrow formula contains about twice the recommended dosage of lutein, and while up to about 11.5 mg a day is generally thought to be safe, I'm taking a capsule every other day to be on the safe side.  More isn't always better, particularly when you're dealing with a nutrient that's not water soluble. To risk being indelicate, you'll pee out any water soluble nutrients your body doesn't use.  You'll store the fat soluble ones and they can build up, which is why being cautious with dosages of vitamins A, D, E, and K is so important.
B0013OX9NC Sometmes when I'm tired or working late my vision gets kind of blurry, taking 1 or 2 of these almost immediately clears my vision a bit. Though I dont have any profound clinical vision prolem, I can't help but think this can also be a prophylactic
B0013OX9NC I've noticed that Vitamin A has a positive impact on my skin, so I was eager to give Lutein a try because, as they say, it's like a super vitamin A.To better test the results, I temporarily cut out my usual intake of Vitamin A supplements to see if the Lutein would do even better or worse. For two weeks I took the recommended dose of 1 capsule per day (with a meal). I did not see any improvements, although I did not see any negative reaction either. The capsules swallowed easily and my body gave no upset complaints to the supplement.After the two weeks, I decided to see if taking two capsules per day would make any difference. It did not, that I could see. No noticeable skin improvements and no upset stomach or reaction.Unfortunately my eyesight is already great, so I wasn't able to monitor any potential effects it may have on the eyes (which is its main benefit, as they say).Overall, I deem it about as good as Vitamin A in regards to supplements that improve the tone and texture of skin. Although I didn't notice any miracles, having stopped taking my usual A supplement, I believe I would have noticed a negative reaction if the Lutein was less effective than A, so I believe it was doing something. Since the price is great and Jarrow is a trust-worthy company (one of my favorites), I feel these supplements deserve a positive rating.
B0013OX9NC I have tried to rotate a lot of these Jarrow products, because my kitchen drawer looks like a drugstore.  I have just begun taking these and I haven't seen a difference in my vision. My eyes are ok in the morning and I only use glasses for driving and at night when my eyes are tried and can't focus.  We will see if these pills help me as I take them.
B0013OX9NC This formula has excellent amount of Lutein, 20mg, and price is very good, about 1/2 the price for same formula of 'brand name' in CVS.  Please take with food as softgels are fat-soluble.  I already take a lot of different vitamins a day, and was glad this addition is just one small softgel.
B0013OX9NC Jarrow Formulas Lutein 20mgAmerican Optometric Association says there is no recommended daily intake for lutein and zeaxanthin, most recent studies show a health benefit for lutein supplementation at 10 mg/day and leaxanthin supplementation at 2 mg/day.Lutein (LOO-teen) and zeaxanthin are important nutrients found in green leafy vegetables as well as other foods such as eggs. Many studies have shown that lutein and zeaxanthin reduce the risk of chronic eye diseases, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and cataracts.AMD and cataract incidence are growing. Worldwide, more than 25 million people are affected by age-related macular degeneration and the formation of cataracts. AMD is the leading cause of blindness in people over age 55 in the Western world and the incidence is expected to triple by 2025.This is captured from the American Optometric Association website.  I wasn't sure how to rate something like this as how do you know that it is working unless you conduct a double blind study with statistically viable numbers over a decade.  Since I don't have a decade or population to conduct such study, I am dependent on my own research.  My ophthalmologist has recommended taking Lutein.  This product provides that at a reasonable price of $9.99 at Amazon.  The star rating is based on value for the money, it does NOT say this will work or is working since I have no way to prove that.  However considering the consequences of blindness, I will take whatever steps necessary to possibly prevent it.
B0013OX9NC After a 23andMe genetics test indicated an increased possibility of developing macular degeneration, my ophthalmologist suggested that I add a zeaxanthin supplement to my diet.Will it help?  Beats me...and one person's experience is hardly definitive.  But as long as it doesn't cause any unpleasant side effects (and I haven't had any), I don't see any downside, especially when the upside is some protection against MD.
B0013OX9NC Jarrow Formulas Lutein 20mg are an excellent source of Lutein and Zeaxanthin. As we age, our eyesight diminishes and isn't what it used to be. The combination of ingredients in this product are formulated to help improve and sustain the eyesight and eye health as we age.Knowing what I've witnessed many relatives go through all sorts of diminished vision and other eye problems as they aged, I'm determined to do what I can to avoid as many of the same problems as best as I can.I want to live as long as possible and have the eyesight to enjoy watching it all happen around me!
B0013OX9NC The \"typical\" American diet is deficient in many compounds. We don't eat enough veggies and we miss out on a lot of the good foods necessary to keep our bodies running at optimal health. Lutein is one compound sorely missed by many, unless you are a big salad eater. My eyes are already pretty bad (most likely from a childhood of eating crap) and I don't want them getting any worse. I plan to incorporate this into my busy (and sometimes veggie deficient) lifestyle.
B0013OX9NC After eye surgery I have had trouble with halos around lights. The doctor said it would probably take 6 months to have them go away, if then. I started taking this supplement and in less than a month the halos are hardly there. I will continue to take the 1 recommended capsule a day and hopefully it will continue to work.The ingredients in here are some of the same that are in green leafy vegetables which also help vision, so evidently this will add to any natural foods you are taking to improve your health.
B0013OX9NC After reading so much about Lutein and its Properties I decided to get \"Jarrow Formulas Lutein 20mg, 60 Softgels\" Lutein Supplements are use to Treat or Prevent Eye Diseases, such as Cataracts and Macular Degeneration known to be build up in the Retina and Lens of the Eye, Lutein is thought to Protect the Eye from Injury induced by Free Radicals. Even though I only been taking it for just a month I know I can see everything a little Brighter...Really! I was Amazed how Bright and Crisp Clear I can see everything, you get results within 3 Weeks, to the Point that I got Lutein Capsules for my Entire Family. I was surprised by the Size of the Softgels, they are a little Big for my Taste, but easy to Swallow. To increase your Lutein intake without the use of Lutein Supplements, include Lutein-Rich Foods like Kale, Spinach, Cabbage, Green Beans, Mangoes, and Papayas in your daily Diet. I like taking Lutein which is part of my daily routine intake Recommended!... Thank You D.D.
B0013OX9NC I received these pills from Amazon so I may review them for you.  I have been having a bit of a problem with my eyes, tired, dry and just feeling off.I have only been taking these a short time but I must review them now, but in this short amount of time they have helped me a little. My eyes are less achy and a funny thing happened I have always had a dark ring around my eyes, and this has happened with another product also,and it happened with this one too, the ring came back giving life back to my dull eyes. Since this product does not cause any side effects I will continue to use them.  I like the way my eyes look and beginning to feel.
B0013OX9NC In today's world, bombarded as we are with UV, pollution and etc, not to mention living longer, eye health is important. Lutein has been shown to be a effective tool for vision health. Jarrow is one of the most respected brands in the business. This is also a pretty good price and easy to take, with no nasty \"vitamin burps' afterwards.\"Looks like\" you'll want to get some, then.
B0013OX9NC I had to give up wearing contacts 10 years ago (even the brands made for dry eyes). A year or so ago I started taking a more expensive brand of lutein and it made a pronounced difference in eye dryness, so I could again wear contacts on a limited basis. I've been taking the Jarrow Lutein for 6 weeks and it seems to be working just as well.
B0013OX9NC This little softgel is about the size of a navy bean and it smooth and easy to swallow. The inside ingredients contain marigold petal extracts, Lutein and Zeaxanthin. The softgel shell is made of gelatin, glycerin and water. Even though there is no wheat, gluten, dairy, egg , fish/shellfish or peanuts/tree nuts, this is not a vegan product because of the gelatin. It is said to be good for the Macula of the eye and to support visual function. I hope it works, as I had a hard time reading the micro small print on the label. Take one a day with food.
B0013OX9XW Natto is a great source of vitamin K which improves circulation and promotes healing. As someone who rock climbs and gets minor injures fairly often, I find the ability of my blood to clot a priority. whether it's a placebo effect or not, I have noticed that cuts heal faster and it's easier to stop the blood after injuries.As with all vitamins, try it out, what do you have to lose? The possibility of a benefit that's proven to work for others (such as myself) is worth your personal investigation.
B0013OX9XW I've suffered with muscle cramping, mostly in my legs, but also in other areas, for decades.Since I began taking this supplement, I have had fewer episodes of awakening in the middle of the night with severe leg cramps.I still have to use nitroglycerine periodically for angina but not as much as I was using during the month or so before I started on NattoMax.I haven't noticed much difference in my blood pressure.
B0013OX9XW In many ways Nattokinase is the roto-rooter of the circulatory system. Derived from natto, a fermented soybean dish popular in Japan, it is reputed to have clot dissolving functions.  Additionally, it is believed to support the circulatory health.My mother had a stroke and that type of condition runs in her side of the family. Although to date, I am free of those issues, I thought this might be a good preventative. The capsules are small and easy to swallow with no discernible taste or smell. I have experienced no side effects from taking the recommended one a day. Much harder to assess is whether or not I have been enjoying any benefits. Good health is usually taken for granted. But seeing the results of circulatory problems and clots in others, taking these capsules seem a small price to pay to avoid those undesirable consequences.Obviously, these should not be used it you are on any type of blood thinning medication. But this seems to be an easy and natural way for people with a predisposition to clotting and other circulatory issues to maintain health and viability.
B0013OX9XW Shortly after I received this product I had an injury to my shoulder and my doctor and physiologist told me not to take this in case I needed surgery. They didn't want me to take anything with anti-coagulant properties. Fortunately I didn't need surgery, and completed my physical therapy about 3 weeks ago. At that time they cleared me to start taking the Jarrow NattoMax. I'm not sure if I'm seeing any improvements, but I wanted to try to see if it would help with my chronic pain. I also wanted to see if I had any adverse effects because I wanted my husband to take it for Dupuyene's Contracture - a build up of scar tissue that causes at least one finger to be drawn down toward the palm. I didn't have any adverse effects and he was anxious to give this a try, so I just ordered him his own bottle.I would recommend this to anyone who has a build up of scar tissue in the body - it's worth a try!
B0013OX9XW So far from what I have experienced is Jarrow's products are consitent.Jarrow Formulas NattoMax, 100 mg, 30 CountJarrow Formulas NattoMax is a highly purified Nattokinase with vitamin K removed. Nattokinase is naturally occurring in traditional Japanese food (natto) fermented by Bacillus subtilus natto.NattoMax is concentrated without solvents. Each capsule offers 2,000 Fibrinolytic Units. Nattokinase is a fibrinolytic enzyme that supports healthy circulation by its effects on serine protease-mediated digestion of fibrin.*Its hard to tell super fast because vitamins are vitamins. These seem correct and honorable.
B0013OX9XW Natto is attributed to help reduce blot clotting.  As with any supplement, please seek the advice of your health care provider before taking anything.  Jarrow Formulas, who makes this product, advises that anyone taking blood-thinning products avoid this product.NattoMax contains 100 mg of natto extract.  Other ingredients are cellulose and magnesium stearate.  The capsule is made of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose.  The natto is extracted without the use of solvents.The product contains no wheat, gluten, dairy, soybeans, egg, fish, shellfish, peanuts or tree nuts, and is suitable for vegans.  While it doesn&#8217;t contain soybeans, natto is, in essence, a soy product, so if you are sensitive to soy, take note.  While teh label reads 'no soybean', natto is fermented soybean.The bottle contains 30 capsules, with a dosage of 1 per day unless directed otherwise by your doctor.According to studies, natto consumption can aid circulation, and deter blood clotting.  It also can help lower blood pressure, based on some studies.I began taking NattoMax a few weeks ago, after finding my blood pressure, while not high, was higher than usual.  After taking it, I have noticed my bp a little lower.  I am certainly not suggesting natto as an alternative to good diet and exercise, or medical care, but it is a good supplement to consider.
B0013OX9XW This is truly a Godsend!  Not only does this act as a blood thinner, but it is a good alternative to prescription drugs that make the same claim.  Naturally you will want to talk to your doctor before you start any supplement regimen.  That having been said, Jarrow is a trusted name in health related products.  The results you will get from this will most likely be good.  You don't tend to suffer from side effects from this supplement.  I have read accounts by others who have now started enjoying pain free lives and having blood clots busted up inside of them and become history once they started taking this.  I HEARTILY recommend it!
B0013OX9XW I have been taking this for a couple of weeks and have not felt anything noticeable. At the same time I have not experienced any bad side effects either. But this is one of those supplements where you need to take it consistently for a long time before the effects begin to kick in. And this supplement is vegetarian based with no artificial ingredients.
B0013OX9XW This falls into the category of stuff I'm not quite sure about, because there's no completely obvious test I can do on my own to see if it's changed things. It's not like I have my own bloodwork lab going on.There's certainly a lot of reason to believe that excessive clotting is a bad thing, though I'd probably be careful not to take this if you're about to donate blood or platelets or something, since you do need to do some clotting in that kind of situation. If you're concerned about stroke risk or similar issues, this seems to have some pretty good science behind it for why it's worth taking.I haven't found the pills to be gross or exceptionally difficult to swallow or anything like that which would lead me to say this is something to avoid, at least!
B0013OX9XW These are easy to swallow and don't have a scent associated with the gel coating. I can't really tell if it's working or not so I take off one star for that.
B0013OX9XW As you likely know, Nattokinase is an enzyme created from Natto which is derived from boiled soybeans.  Supposedly, it's a folk remedy for a variety of issues, mostly related to circulatory disorders.  In short, it's a blood thinner, although it may have other beneficial properties.Candidly, I don't &#34;feel&#34; any different, but I will assume that it's doing some good.  Supplements are quite hard to rate, but supposing that it works, it seems like a good product at a good price.  4 stars.
B0013OX9XW I've taken natto before for circulatory issues so I thought I'd try Jarrow brand this time. So far so good. It's not the type of supplement that you'll &#34;feel&#34; working. It also takes time for the effects to kick in. I'm taking it due to some poor circulation in different areas of my body (a hereditary thing). I haven't seen any positive effects yet - it really needs to be taken for at least 60 days for this kind of health problem, but will be back to update if anything comes up. In the past I've only noticed that I would bleed much more easily if I cut myself. It's also helpful for fibroids.
B0013OX9XW This is probably the best way for me to get natto - love it!  Vitamin K-free!  Goodness, I have plenty of supplements with K and don't need more.Natto is made from soybeans fermented with bacillus subtilis.  Some eat it directly on rice for breakfast and it would probably be a good test of my courage to try it that way.  I'm glad to take it exactly in the NattoMax form.
B0013OX9XW I can&#8217;t tell if this has helped or not but the Natto extract supports healthy circulation. I have diabetes with a lot of circulation problems so this supplement was definitely worth trying for me. I will continue to take it because it is just a one-a-day pill and is reasonably priced. I hope that overtime, it can make a difference.
B0013OX9XW Nattokinase is a mix of protein-digesting enzymes derived from fermented soybeans. According to some research, it exhibits a strong  fibrinolytic effect, i.e. it can break-up harmful blood clots and improve circulation.I take protein-digesting enzymes regularly as a part of my supplement regimen. This includes bromelain, papain, and pancreatin (which contains trypsin, to digest protein). Taken on an empty stomach, based on some human and animal studies, they may thin the blood, have fibrinolytic effects, reduce inflammation, lessen the severity of sports injuries, and even prevent the spread of cancer. Nattokinase is another valuable enzyme to go along with these others, except of all the enzymes listed, it may be the most powerful in dissolving blood clots.Since I am younger (35), very healthy (I run about 20 miles a week, eat well, etc), I haven't seen any improvement from taking this supplement. I have taken it along with my other enzymes on an empty stomach before running. I haven't felt anything from taking it per se. However, based on its benefits, I assume it is helping my body avoid inflammation, along with the other enzymes I take.Notice I have mentioned taking this on an empty stomach. Enzymes like Nattokinase will digest food. If taken with food, it will have that effect. The label says take with food, but that is wrong. For the positive health benefits related to circulation, take it on an empty stomach. This way, the enzyme reaches the gut and gets taken up into the bloodstream.One drawback of this product is the price. Other enzymes like bromelain and papain are cheaper. Since I don't have any circulation issues, I will likely stick with cheaper protein-digesting enzymes. However, if I needed them therapeutically to treat circulatory issues, I would definitely add Nattokinase to the mix.Overall this is a good product for a decent price (at least compared to other nattokinase products; all of them are fairly expensive as far as supplements go). I have found Jarrow supplements to be high quality for a decent price, at least when purchased at Amazon.
B0013OX9XW This is a product that has pharmacological effects.  Some folks use St Johns Wort to treat depression instead of taking prescription valium.  Nattomax affects blood clotting and some folks use it a non-prescribed substitute for Coumadin (warfarin).  A lot of people would argue against doing this self prescribing because of the potential for overdose and for unintended side-effects.  However, you cannot argue that it isn;t cheaper than going the prescription route.
B0013OX9XW Nattokinase has been shown to help with lipid profiles. Lowering LDL and Triglycerides and raising HDL.I trust Jarrow's products. I have used them often in the past. Nattokinase alone has been shown to take up to6 month's to see noticeable improvements in blood profiles but it does work. Red Yeast Rice + Nattokinase seems to work faster.Improving blood profiles as quick as 30 days. You can look at a scientific study preformed by theDepartment of Nutrition and Health Science, Chungchou Institute of Technology here [...]
B0013OX9XW For the past 6 months this has replaced my prescription cumadin without any issues. My INR is great and though my doctors are not happy about being cut out of the money making scheme of prescription drugs they cant argue with the results. I was on the road to having to take blood thinners for the rest of my life and the side effects are unpleasant. When I switched to this the side effects slowly dissipated and now are completely gone. I recommend this to anyone wanting a natural way to get the same results as a prescription. Of course always consult with your doctor first and make sure they monitor you along the way.
B0013OX9XW Nattokinase prevents fibrinolysis (blood clots/too thick blood) and thins blood. Jarrow Formulas makes this NattoMax 2000 without the use of solvents which I like. It does use magnesium stearate as a flow agent; some people seem to think that magnesium stearate is a form of magnesium that has nutritional benefits for humans but that is not true; it is merely a flow agent used to make it easier to fill the capsules and is considered a dangerous poison by many leading medical experts. If you can not find nattokinase free of magnesium stearate, you may want to try Jarrow Formula's NattoMax.
B0013OX9XW Nattokinase is an enzyme extracted from a traditional Japanese food called natto. Many westerners don't find natto appealing since it is made from fermented soybeans and has a weird texture and taste to it. However, natto has been clinically studied to have the cardiovascular benefits of a blood thinner and clot-buster, to promote heart health and improve blood circulation.Jarrow Formulas has a great reputation for making high quality yet affordable supplemental products. NattoMax has the vitamin K removed since too much vitamin K has the potential to increase blood clots. I ordered the NattoMax to try out. I won't know the results for at least a few months. What I do know is that it's easy to take - just 1 pill a day with meal - and certainly a lot easier to take than raw natto.
B0013OX9XW Jarrow Formulas NattoMax is inferior to Jarrow Formulas Red Yeast Rice + Nattokinase, which additionally to nattokinase contains also red yeast rice beneficial for lowering cholesterol, if with monacolin K.  Nattokinase has only a potential to thin blood, but the effective dosage is unknown.  Thus, nattokinase with unknown effectiveness is inferior to plain aspirin with known blood thining effectiveness.
B0013OX9XW I was sent these pills for free to review, but really how can one give a rational review? I took them for weeks, and felt nothing different. No better, no worse. I see Jarrow says they offer over 350 products. Who can afford to take all of those? How are we supposed to choose which ones are actually useful? Maybe they do something, but I don't have x-ray vision to see it.One thing I am not impressed with in particular is that these individual capsules can easily be twisted open with your fingers. With all the product tampering scares over the years, this seems like manufacturing to 1970's standards, to me. Capsules should be permanently sealed.
B0013OX9XW This product is highly recommended for reducing the risk of blood clots and strokes, and has also bee recommended for alzheimer's patients to increase circulation to the brain.I can't vouch for those results as I have only taken this a short time, but the pills are easy to swallow and the scientific studies on this product are encouraging.I would caution against taking this with aspirin as Wiki says that one patient reported a cerebral hemorrhage with taking with this and aspirin, so do use this with caution under the guidance of a physician.
B0013OX9XW I am taking this for a long term benefit.  I wanted to improve my clotting. It is a genetic issue in my family. I haven't had a major bleed while taking this. It is easy to take and I have had no uncomfortable side effects.I find Jarrows products to be high quality and reliable.
B0013OX9XW Actually I know why they removed the vitamin K.  People on Warfarin or Coumadin have their doses set to their current blood levels and cannot change the amount of leafy vegetables they eat or add Vitamin K supplements without exceeding the therapeutic window of their drug.  But hey, that is a niche market (five stars for them) and most of us use natto supplements because both the enzymes and the Vitamin K2.  Jarrow makes great products but my money goes to a nattokinase supplement with the full spectrum.Natto's vitamin K is believed to increase levels of activated osteocalcin and result in a significant reduction in fracture risk.  It also helps blood coagulate.  The stripped down NattoMax does help regulate fibrin. When fibrin accumulates in blood vessels due to age and dietary imbalances, blood begins to flow less freely which can reduce oxygen transport to heart and brain tissue, resulting in suboptimal function. Meanwhile, excess fibrin can make blood vessels less pliable and lead to elevated blood pressure. Even Vitamin-K stripped nattokinase helps to maintain proper blood viscosity, fibrin levels and healthy circulation.To sum up, if you are on blood thinners this is a five star product.  But see if you can work with your doctor to reduce the drugs and take full-spectrum nattokinase and turmeric instead.
B0013OX9XW I can report so far, so good with Jarrow Formulas NattoMax. I have had no trouble taking the 100 mg capsules and no unpleasant side effects.My wife eats natto. I won't kiss her unless she's brushed her teeth. My sons eat natto. I won't sit next to them until they have finished their meal.I can't tell you if natto is more odorous than the King of Fruits, durian, as I haven't traveled to Southeast Asia. From what I've read and seen on TV travel shows, durian and natto are popular with only a minority of the people in the countries from which these foods come.I mention all of this because my wife laughed at me when I first tried this supplement. She offered me a breakfast of rice, dried seaweed and natto instead.\"It is cheaper than taking it from a bottle.\"On that point she is correct. At a cost of more than $10 per month (there's only 30 capsules per bottle), some people might consider eating the fermented soybeans directly. I wish them luck with that as it is too smelly for my palate.I am going to finish out my bottle and add a replacement through Amazon's Subscribe and Save program, which saves me an additional 15%.Rating: Four stars (I'd like to have more capsules in each bottle for convenience.)
B0013OX9XW Nattokinase is an enzyme derived from fermented soy (natto), which is great for clearing blood clots and reducing blood pressure. It normally comes with vitamin K, another blood thinning compound, so Jarrow provides this option of getting the enzyme without vitamin K in case you are already on blood thinning medications. This supplement is safe when used as directed and it is one that is effective for what people usually use it for. Jarrow provides high quality at a reasonable cost. This is certainly an item that can help with specific health concerns.
B0013OX9XW I was very curious about Jarrow Formulas NattoMax, 100mg, but since I've been please with all the Jarrow products I've taken in the past, requested a bottle of 30.  In the test tube, red blood cells do not aggregate in the presence of nattokinase, and since natto is a product which isn't easily available to me, this option for reducing blood clots serves as a viable and more tasty option.  I have not been diagnosed with clotting, however have a genetic disposition and family history, so I'm adding this to my supplement regime.  The vegetarian caps are easy to swallow, I take one daily with a meal, and I've had no reaction or problem.  I'll be ordering the larger bottle to save some money.
B0013OX9XW Nattokinase is an extract that comes from a process of boiling soybeans that have been fermented with a particular bacteria.It is thought to be a blood thinner so it&#8217;s often used to treat issues that affect the circulatory system such as high blood pressure, heart disease, varicose veins, etc. I don&#8217;t have any of these problems, but a lot of people swear by the use of nattokinase.I take it preventatively since blood thinning could protect against blood clots and heart attacks. Obviously, however, there are risks to thinned blood. So, consult a doctor and use care when using this product.I also like the price and the company. Jarrow is a respected manufacturer and adheres to the FDAs GMP (good manufacturing practice). This is important because some supplement companies can be shady. With Jarrow you know the product is high quality and free of adulteration.Overall, this is a great, reasonably priced product that has a load of benefits. If you have circulatory issues, consult your doctor and give it a try.
B0013OX9XW Jarrow Formulas NattoMax is a supplement that is vegetarian friendly.  Natto is made from fermented soybeans and has been used for almost a thousand years.  I have been using the, for almost a month and I'm enjoying the results.  If you're looking to add some natto into your diet then I would start with Jarrow Formulas NattoMax.  Especially for vegans who are looking for a healthy supplement.
B0013OX9XW Since being diagnosed with high blood pressure, I have added an arsenal of cardiovascular-friendly supplements to my diet. The latest is Nattokinase, which clinical trials has shown effective in achieving a moderate reduction in blood pressure. So far, only a couple of days into taking it, I will say that it seems to be helping, showing a couple of points drop since before I started with it. Time will tell whether this will be sufficient, or whether I'll have to take medication.
B0013OX9XW Even though my husband has not has his blood work re-done to see if this has helped any, I still wanted to write about it.  It is a good product in that the pills are easy to swallow and you only need one a day (unless you are directed otherwise by your health professional).  Also, the price is right -I got the 90 ct here for the same price that my local Whole Foods sells the 30 ct for!  Unbelievable.
B0013OX9XW I offer that my past experience with Jarrow's brand of products has been very good. In this case...I am not saying that it has not been beneficial, but it may be just too soon to tell.
B0013OX9XW Because I can't easily find organic natto (the food) I take natto in supplement form.  I am hoping that given enough time it will help to reduce or eliminate some of my health issues such as uterine fibroids, pain during ovulation & muscle spasms.  Jarrow like most of the brands I have found so far contain way too many fillers such as magnesium stearate & hydroxypropylmethycellulose.  Jarrow seems to have the average 100mg or 2000 FU of Nattokinase as other brands as well.  The only difference I've been able to find between the Jarrow brand & others is that Jarrow claims the Vit. K has been removed.The capsules are small & easy to swallow.I'm going to continue to keep a look out in hopes of finding a brand with less fillers.  I recently came across Enzymedica brand & when I finish with this bottle, I think I will try them unless I find something I think might be even better.  With the myriad of supplements I take, I would like to reduce the amount of &#34;other&#34; ingredients as much as I possibly can.
B0013OX9XW While I can't say definitively that NattoMax has helped to lower by blood pressure, it has gone down over the month I've been taking it. It was getting a little high and rather than use prescription drugs, I thought I'd try something a bit more natural. These capsules are easy to swallow and have no detrimental side effects that I've noted. If anything, it makes me feel more mel
B0013OX9XW Since taking this product I have had once cycle and what is usually pretty heavy my period was lighter and flowed better.. Also recent trip to doctor shows perfect BP.. Lots of good research about this product, I received this for free in exchange for review but I will order again ..
B0013OX9XW My husband's blood pressure was running too high and he is against Western Medical treatment.  I saw this and thought it might be worth a try, and he accepted it without any problem.  (This is a man that won't take a Tylenol!)  They are just regular size clear filled gelcaps.  They don't taste like anything to me, and they didn't smell bad.  They are no problem to take.Neither of us had any GI side effects - no burps or unpleasant side effects.After 3-4 days, my husband noted that he was sleeping better -he said I don't hear my pulse in my ears anymore when I lay down.  He reported feeling better.It's about a month's supply, but the supplement itself is definitely a keeper.  His blood pressure started coming down after a week, and is now fairly close to the normal range- it does get a bit borderline but it's MUCH better.For me, I quit taking them because I got a bruise that I couldn't explain.  I don't think I need them though.  My husband, on the other hand, had no bruising problems at all.  Mine might have not been related, but I decided to err on the safe side.The Jarrow brand is very trustworthy to me, and I've never got a product from them that wasn't fresh and of better ingredients.
B0013OX9XW I tried this purely to see if it would help my feet warm up. Natto is claimed to help improve circulation, and I've had mildly chilly toes since I was a kid. I've noticed a little less of the cold feet effect on cold mornings, but not enough to where I can say that this stuff is definitely making a major difference. From the other reviews here and research I've done, this does work very well for some heart and blood pressure issues, and if it's getting folks off prescription drugs while providing the same or better benefits, while not adding the side-effects of most big pharma products, I'm all for it.But since I don't really have a major health issue that this would impact noticeably, I can only give these a neutral three stars. I'll keep taking them, but as it's already warm where I live, it's hard to say if my these are improving my circulation much.Sorry I can't be more helpful, but, honesty first.
B0013OX9XW Natto is fermented soybeans and is a popular food in Japan. This supplement is designed to help with circulation and the cardiovascular.The capsules have no taste and go down easy. I'm also thrilled that this is a supplement that vegetarians can take. It is reasonably priced and made by Jarrow, a company that has a proven history of reliability.This product may also help prevent strokes, and I consider it a good insurance policy to keep myself healthy.
B0013OX9XW Check with your doctor before you use natto.  Don't use it if you are on coumadin or warfarin, and be really careful and CHECK with your DOCTOR if you are on an aspirin regimen or if you are taking other medicines that can cause bleeding or if you have or have had an ulcer.Natto basically thins your blood.  It's great if, like me, you have some hyper coagulability (I do - it's one aspect of SLE for me), but it isn't something you want to take along with other blood thinners (including aspirin, gingko biloba, willow bark, and even vitamin e).If natto is something that is going to be safe for you, this is an excellent brand.  I take it when I need a break from my NSAIDs (every so often, I get bounce back headaches from daily use of aspirin, and I have to take a week off).  This keeps my labs stable while I do that.
B0013OX9XW I've been taking this for a number of years. It is an amazing product. Research it and then try it. It works.
B0013OX9XW Nattokinase is an enzyme that thins the blood.  It is supposed to be similar to what warfarin, coumadin and aspirin do, but I would not stop taking these drugs and using the NattoMax without first consulting my physician.  My husband's cholesterol has been on the high side for years and he has only recently begun taking NattoMax so it is too soon to tell if it is helping to reduce his cholesterol levels or not.  But, I feel it certainly is not doing him any harm and the price is so reasonable.  Also, he only has to take one of these pills each day with a meal - usually breakfast.  Since I am required to write a review within 30 days of receiving this product it is too soon to get another cholesterol check done, but I will update this review when he does.
B0013OX9XW Good price and as always with Jatrow, this is a quality product.  Research the product before using if not chosen on recommendation of someone reputable.
B000A2HDXA I don't play these myself, I bought them for my daughter. They look kinda flimsy but for the price, they are ok for beginners to play."
B000A2HDXA Im a beginner. Good harps. Good solid sound.I cant bend at all so no idea if its just me.Youtube these, there's loads of videos."
B000A2HDXA I have other harmonica's but thought I'd like a set of blues harps.  I thought that if it's made by Hohner, it must be fairly good.  Wow, was I wrong.  Too hard to push notes through them.  I wouldn't recommend these to anyone."
B000A2HOB6 I tried these on my 2008 Talyor GA4e and the sound was just a bit to bright.  The heavier bass strings didn't really add the bassy sound I was hoping for just more of a thud.  YMMV."
B000A2HOB6 Clean and clear sound. Great for strumming and using a pick but a little soft for finger picking. I prefer a string with a little more volume.  They tune well and hold a tune well."
B000A2HOB6 I usually use \"extra-lights\" because my fingers are wimps, I like the bottom E to go down to a small .010. I have heard though, that you get more oomph, bass, and it is better for recording to use heavier gauge strings; so I decided to try and start using lights and mediums instead. Also, I finally bought my first Martin (Woo Hoo!) and researched strings for it, and I read a comment from one person who said the lights would have slight buzz, and the mediums put too much pressure on the neck and he said the \"Light- Mediums\" were a happy medium and a good balance.When I got my Martin D15 M, I cleaned it up, and then restrung it with a set of these \"Light -Mediums\". At first my fingertips protested and got real sore real fast; but that is because I am adding .025 width to the E string (.010 to .0125) ouch!  I  just have to build up my callouses, which will take a few weeks of torture, ugh. But, the sound is AWESOME. Part of it is the Martin guitar of course, but these strings, when I hit the G chord, ring out with a deep, warm and long-sustaining bass thump. You feel it in your chest when you hit the bass strings, the 6th, 5th and 4th.  The treble strings bend pretty easily. No buzzing. They have no coating , so they SQUEAK like hell. (TIP: I put a molecule or 2 of hand lotion on my fingertips 15 minutes prior to playing and it helps keep the squeak down) These strings are great, I recommend them. I will try and update my review 3 months from now and let you know about their longevity, etc."
B000A2HOB6 Tried these on a Laguna acoustic guitar. They are basic standard traditional strings. They sound good, they are light weight. On this guitar they sound a bit too bright. My preference is to use Elixirs, prefer the feel and sound on this guitar (Elixir PolyWeb Acoustic Guitar Strings (Light)).These strings do not last less time than the Elixirs. Mostly fresh strings sound good on a guitar. Some people like a brand new set before every gig, others will go weeks or months before changing. If you are an every gig person, well the Martin set is probably perfect for you - they are much less expensive than others. Leaving strings in for an extended period - Elixirs or other coated strings are probably a better idea.There is no such thing as a perfect guitar string for every guitar. The choice is all about your personal preference and the guitar you play. I think the Martins are a very good value in a standard traditional style. So for the price, these are an excellent value."
B000A2HOB6 Crikey, where to begin. Firstly, I hated the fact that they package two strings to a paper packet. Secondly, they mismarked one of the packets, so it appeared I had two &#34;D&#34; strings, instead of two &#34;E&#34; strings. Lastly, and certainly the least favorably, once tuned up, the strings sounded terrible! They were tinny and clangy sounding. I've never heard worse strings. Fortunately, I had bought a package of Ernie Ball Earthwood med. light, as well. I replaced the godawful Martins with the Ernie Ball's and they were far, far better! Shame on Martin for such a piss poor product. I'll never buy their strings again."
B000A2HOB6 I would definitely buy these strings again.  They are high quality, great durablity and a great price.  The Martin name is synonymous with quality."
B000A2HOB6 I like these even better than the Martin Custom Lights. They give off such a warm tone, and are holding up very well."
B000A2HOB6 After reading all the great reviews, I moved to these Light/Medium strings from the light gauge. They do sound much better and have a better tone than the light gauge. However, I noticed one thing that has driven me crazy. Finger slides are much harder with these strings. The lower strings (E, A G) just don't slide as easily until there is some buildup in them. As a result my fingers get out of position and don't hit clear notes until I've slid those areas a couple of times. That's probably due to the oil and other nasties build up in the strings or me just getting used to them. The packaging was also a bit confusing. Since there are two strings to an envelope, it seems I too easily get the strings reversed on set up. Other string makers I have tried, color coded their strings and it made it much easier to string up. Overall good strings and I'll probably buy them again."
B000A2HOB6 By definition, medium is an in between size. But when it comes to guitar strings, most of the range goes from extra light to medium. On that scale, these strings would be above a literal medium. For me, the guitar is not an everyday instrument. I don't typically spend five hours a day with one, and sometimes go weeks without picking one up. But I do have periods where I will spend many hours a day playing and don't want something that will kill me.Medium in the guitar string sense of the word is too much for me. Light and custom light are easier to play, but can make a higher end Martin guitar sound like one closer to the bottom of the line. For me, these light-medium are exactly where I want my strings to be.If you like Martin's medium, find them a bit much at times, but find that you give up too much when you play much lighter ones, you may find that these are a great choice. I don't feel I am missing anything compared to the Medium. If I had two identical guitars with new strings of each type, I would probably find differences in a side by side comparison. But without that, I don't think I'd notice the difference with normal listening. With the lighter varieties, that would be far from true.If Martin extra light and light were the skim milk and 1% milk of strings, these light-medium would be the 2% that came along for people who wanted something lighter but still came close to the whole milk taste."
B000A2HOB6 love these strings, but I have always been and still am a fan of Ernie Ball, they just sound better, bend easier and have a longer life span, but Martin are very good too, I just prefer Ernie Ball, but they were sold out and I needed strings fast."
B000A6ASSS these are the best strings around.  last a long time especially if you live near the beach where corrosion is always a concern."
B000A6ASSS I keep an acoustic out on a stand in my office to keep handy for when inspiration strikes.  I used d'addarios for many years. I switched to these and their longevity is drastically more noticeable.  they sound great too. The added expense is more than made up for by the extra long life afforded by the coating."
B000A6ASSS They're 2 days on and sound fantastic already. I've come to expect nothing but excellence from Elixirs, they're the best I've played on to date, whether electric or acoustic. I very highly recommend these to anyone looking to get great tone straight out of the box"
B000A6ASSS Personally, I love the nanoweb strings.  I have 4 guitars, and they each get played once every couple weeks.  As I'm no pro, I don't want to put strings on them that I'm going to have to change every time, just to mess around at my apt.I don't mind that they are extra slippery, or that they sound a tad bit \"different\" than other strings.  They're exactly what I want - A string that makes my guitar sound good for 4 months without changing strings."
B000A6ASSS These acoustic strings are used on a Laguna acoustic guitar. They are just the right weight, and just the right amount of flex. We've tried D'Addario, brighter sound (D'Addario Acoustic Guitar Strings Set, EXP 80/20 Lite), and Martin, a little stiff (Martin Strings SP Phosphor Bronze 12.5-55 MSP4150). In the end, these Elixirs sound and feel best on this guitar.The difference between these strings - nanoweb and polyweb - the nano's have a very light coating that you almost don't feel. So if you like standard not coated strings, the nano's are probably the way to go. If you want a bit of softness, the polys are a better bet.As has been said, there is no perfect guitar string for everyone. The perfect guitar string is the one that feels and sounds right to you on your guitar. For the combination we have, these are outstanding strings.On the strings lasting longer, that's hard to say. Fresh strings do sound better. It's clear that the wound strings do not corrode like non-coated strings. But I'm not certain these last so much longer. We buy them because they sound good and have the right amount of flex to them - playability. Corrosion or crud on the string isn't the sole factor in changing strings.Elixir is a wonderful company. On my third or fourth sets of Elixir strings, the G string snapped as my son was tuning the guitar for the first time. Elixir is outstanding, they will replace any string that doesn't perform up to your standard.The other amazing thing - I've watched tons of videos and watched a lot of guys change strings, and I'm still very confused. The Elixir website (it's pretty simple elixirstring dot com) is outstanding. Ther is a two part video from the Taylor factory on how to change strings. I swear that if you follow those instructions, you will change strings in minutes. It is so simple and so reproducible. I love this technique."
B000A6ASSS Elixir Strings are the best I have ever used, they sound great and last far longer (tonally) than anything else I have tried....."
B000A6ASSS I only play Elixir strings.  They are relatively finger friendly, hold their tune well and are much longer lasting than many strings I have played in the past.  These were for an electric acoustic I just bought, which is why I got a lighter string than I normally play.  I will move to mediums once I get the feel of the guitar.  Of course, they will be Elixirs as well."
B000A6ASSS Elixir's Nanoweb Light Phosphor Bronze strings are the best strings I've ever used on my Alvarez acoustic -- a guitar I've now owned for over 30 years.  They certainly are the longest lasting strings that seem to be out there, they have a nice punchy tone, and are easy on the fingers.  Unlike the Elixir Extra Lights that I found to be lacking in bass and just a tad on the mushy side on a short-scale guitar, these seem like an ideal combination.  I may buy another set soon and restring the short-scale instrument with lights.  Compared with some brands and gauges of more \"old school\" strings, there may be a little less bass response, but these sound good, pretty even through the set, and the convenience of not having to change strings so often outweighs whatever minor issues that one might have with the ping of the low E string."
B000A6ASSS You cannnot go wrong with Elixir accoustic guitar strings.  Taste in strings is difficult to discuss as what appeals to one may not appeal to another.  However, you cannot go wrong with those strings.  I highly recommend them.  I like their mellow sound which will last longer than other strings I have tried."
B000A6ASSS This is the only brand I would ever buy the sound is superior and easy to play. These are well worth the money!"
B000A6ASSS I love the Elixir strings. They sound great and play easy. I would recommend them to anyone. Give them a try.."
B000A6ASSS I am a beginner guitar player, so I don't have too much experience with different types of strings.  But, I can say that when compared to the stock strings of my Fender Acoustic guitar, these things are like night and day.  A much brighter sounds and a little easier on the fingers. Highly recommended."
B000A6ASSS You can never go wrong with Elixir Strings Acoustic Phosphor Bronze Strings NANOWEB Coating, 6-String,...The great long lasting sound is worth the extra cost."
B000A6ASSS These strings are just okay - they last about 4 months and then they start to fray a little bit."
B000A6ASSS they seemed a litte expensive but once you play them you know they will last you a VERY long time and their sound is great, these strings are not focused on performance but endurance, best string I've ever played!"
B000A6ASSS I absolutely love these strings. They enhance the deep rich sound on my dreadnought. They last a long time and they keep their great sound for a long time. If there was a way to give 10 stars I would."
B000A6ASSS Polyweb strings have a heavier coating so I prefer nanoweb for the ultra-thin coat and brighter sound. They're easy on my fingers and make the most beautiful sound. Because they're coated and have anti-rust, they last up to months longer than regular strings and don't make much finger sounds. Favorite strings."
B000A6ASSS I only use elixirs on my taylor now 1, because they last months on end while maintaining that new string zing, and 2 because they are super smooth. It's like playing a silk guitar. Get these strings."
B000A6ASSS These strings are noticeably warmer compared to the brighter Bronze Nanoweb. Still a great guitar string. A real winner for Elixir who are the originators of &#34;Goretex&#34; A real triumph of re-invention. Well done Goretex!"
B000A6ASSS If your like me and have a big dreadnaught, especially one with a spruce top and a scalped X bracing, you should really get these strings. They bring out the brightness my guitar was hiding with the D'Daddarios and they are about the same price. Best of all they last extremely long, but I've broken a few strings over the past months. Overall great strings and pretty consistent."
B000A6ASSS Very good string!! I've been using Elixir strings for about ten years now. I've been a full time musician for about 14 years now and for what I do these sound the best and last for 3 or more month's. Within these ten years I've only had 2 strings break on me, and I sometimes work 6 days a week for many for at a time"
B000A6ASSS I have never been much of a fan for coated strings. I normally use DAddario EJ 16's but I do like these Elixirs, after about 4 weeks of playing they are starting to fade, not stay in tune and I notice fuzz on the wound strings at the sound hole. They do feel nice to the touch and a nice tone but pretty expensive for four week turnaround"
B000A6GTDG I am very disappointed. The guitar was packed with its strings tensioned and the top detachment partially from the guitar body.It is unusable until repaired.Update: It has been several days after writing and attach photographs to the seller (Amazon), and have not received any communication."
B000A6GTDG Dont be cheap.  take it to a guitar shop and ask for a full tuning for new guitars.  The low e buzzed pretty bad until i did that.  If you are doing more than just finger-picking, you might want to add pick-shield.  My wife used it for some naked newborn pics and the guitar got most of the compliments which I had very mixed feelings about.  If you play mostly standing, this is the guitar for you.  If you sit down, it slides out from your lap alot due to the curve of the back.  But it is loud and sounds very rich considering the price of the guitar.  Good structural integrity thus far.  My newborn is now 15 months and its is holding up nicely considering how many times she has gotten a hold of it.  I really should get a case."
B000A6GTDG A friend of my has one and I just found in love with it. Great sound! Beautiful color! The Applause exceeds my expectation whether it is unplugged or amplified."
B000A6GTDG No Doubt.... It's not a really exceptional guitar but for the money you get more than you should. First impression of the guitar was terrible. I took it out of the box and started to play. The neck had a huge bow in it. The truss rod was completely loose. I had to adjust the truss rod to make the guitar playable. I'm not sure if it was just my guitar that wasn't set up or if that's the way they come. If they come with a loose truss rod then this guitar is not for a beginning player as properly adjusting the neck is best left to someone who knows what they are going. Once the neck was setup and the guitar tuned I was pleasantly surprised. The guitar sounded pretty good. The neck is thin and has the familiar feel of an electric. Action was good. Upper fret access is really good. The guitar stays in tune while playing. Plugged into an amp playing through the pickup offered no surprises. The bright red red stained finish on the top was a nice touch. I expected red paint. I would have preferred bigger frets for bending and ease of fretting. They are a little small. $175 for a roundback is really a no brainer. If your a beginner or have some playing experience you will enjoy this guitar and the value it offers."
B000A6GTDG This instrument might actually be in a class of its own. That is, it would be extremely difficult to find a guitar in this price band that comes even remotely close in terms of quality; not only with regard to craftsmanship, but certainly the sound it produces. The Applause exceeds expectation whether it is unplugged, amplified, or even run directly through a mixer. Beyond sounding comparatively spectacular, it is far more durable than perhaps any other hollow-bodied instrument on the market due to its components and design. The electronics are reliable and the instrument is accessible, or playable, to even the most novice of musicians. This guitar is the ideal instrument for a beginner or a younger musician, simply because it is cost efficient, durable, and as easy to play for the price as one might be able to find anywhere. Even experienced guitarists will almost certainly appreciate its action, sound and durability if not only for the purposes of practice and travel. This is an exceptional value and an excellent instrument."
B000A6GY1I These strings fit the Bill perfectly for \"MY\" desired sound from a Yamaha LJ-16 Acoustic Guitar which has been \"Doctored\" with Bone Saddle, Pins and nut. When I decided to put the money into the guitar, it was my belief that the Elixir Strings would continue to provide the sound and feel that I like so much in the LJ-16 and after all the work was completed......that proved to be true to form. I did move to the Medium for a little improvement from the Bass side and it's a most outstanding sound from a medium price, hand crafted guitar. Elixir has the best (most comfortable) feel, to me, of all the strings that I've tested and these provide the best (for my liking) sound on this guitar. Try them if it's quality sound that you're looking for..............These are great!!!!"
B000A6GY1I WAY better than stock strings that I received with my Fender acoustic.  I am a beginner guitar player, but I was definitely able to hear a much brighter tone and it felt a little better on the fingers."
B000A6GY1I These strings are my second choice after the Elixir 80/20 Bronze. They are warmer sounding, well balanced. Cost a lot but well worth it to me."
B000A6GY1I Guess this was an open box or dented box but the stuff inside seemed ok.  Will need to check them next week or so."
B000A6GY1I Strings on my accoustic were old, probably corroded.  It was time to replace all with frest strings.  These are great, did the job."
B000A6GY1I I have absolutely no gripes with Elixir nanoweb phosphor bronze strings. I have been using them since the first appeared on the scene and have become my go-to brand. I've read many reviews where some people complain of sting breakage. I have yet to ever break an Elixir acoustic guitar string (in over 10 years of playing them). Can't even imagine. The only other coated string that may be a little better is Clear Tone--but I have had inconsistencies with them and because they cost more, I just go with Elixir and am never disappointed. I'm not a fan of the \"Polyweb\" which has a much more visible thick coating. The nano-webs get it right--they last a long time, sound great, and as far as I know don't flake polymer dust in your kisser."
B000AAGM0M In my house alone we have a bass player, a acoustic guitar player, a sax player and a violinist, that is not counting myself (I attempt to play mandolin and harmonica, usually I fail) so diverse instruments used to require different tuners but with this little all in one the clutter of tuners and pitchpipes is history, I just set aside a music nook in the family room with this mounted to a music stand and everyone can tune before practice, the sax player sneers at us tuners but still finds use for the reference notes and metronome function built into this little beauty.just be sure to buy theKorg CM-100L Clip On Contact Microphone For Tunersif you want to tune your instrument while others are playing."
B000AAGM0M I have had a Korg CA-30 tuner for a few years which I really like.I wanted to get a metronome and liked the idea of having a combined unit.Initially I bought a Boss TU-80 for more money, but returned it because the response time and volume was not as good as the Korg TM-40,and the batteries rattled around in their compartment.Also I like having the middle green LED for tuning.The price here can't be beat and it's a well built item that works great.I was concerned about the power buttons sticking out too much, but they take more pressure that it would seem, and there is a delay until it turns on or off, so that turned out not to be an issue.I am not real hot for the color, but it's nicely made and works well, so I will live with it.I especially like the little folding stand in the back, rather than having to find an old credit card."
B000AAGM0M I have it for more than 6 months and mostly use it for practicing with the metronome.  I have another tuner, which is set EADGBE, that is much easy to tune without any confusion. Although this tuner has flexibility for tuning differently, it's confusing for me because it keeps changing the chord and going left & right +/-20 or more.  However, it's a bonus for using the tuner, and I don't have to bring all to the classes.  For the metronome, which is my initial purpose to purchase it, it's great and have enough adjustable calibration, 13 beats, rhythms, and tempos for practices."
B000AAGM0M I've owned this and a couple of other Korge Tuners in the past, and currently own three.In the past I would use a keyboard to get the bottom E on my guitar and take it from there. These days accurate portable tuners are so inexpensive I keep a few of these around and take at least one with me when I go out with my guitars. I also use it to tune my violin, and it works great.If you buy the new clip on sensor it even gets better.Over all for the cost you can't go wrong. These used to be expensive none-essentials, but today they're small accurate and portable."
B000AAGM0M Got this tuner/metronome as a replacement for a tuner-only model.  This is INCREDIBLY easy to use right out of the package.  The tuner function indicates clearly whether you are sharp or flat (or amazingly in tune).  The metronome is easy to use and has great subdivisions (eighth notes, sixteenths,etc).  For home and ensemble use, I personally couldn't ask for a better gadget for the price.  Very happy with it!"
B000AAGM0M This little box is great for metronome use. It is loud and the screen is easy to see. The tuner function can be a little disconcerting sometimes. It seems to work ok but the display might fluctuate from G to C when tuning to G on a Bass guitar. I used it to set my intonation on a new Bass and it was well worth the price I paid. I would buy another one if I lost this one."
B000AAGM0M I really like this product as it comes complete with all functions anyone needs. I just miss the \"mecanical\" click of a mechanic metronome. The rest is just great. i've bought a cable which allows me to connect the metronome to my line6 amp and the result is much much better."
B000AAGM0M I am quite pleased with this product. It's relatively inexpensive, small and light weight.  It operates on two AA batteries (included). I use it primarily for a banjo and a guitar and the reference is easy to use and appears to be quite accurate.  The LED and large meter allows these old eyes to see it easily. I should have ordered the CM-100 clip-on tuner at the same time (placed a separate order later) to allow to tune in a noisy music (jam or band) environment. You can fine tune your tuning with the calibration settings. There is also a 12 note sound generator built in for reference pitches. The metronome is pretty loud for the small size. I have a hearing loss, so if I can hear it, even while playing, it must be pretty good.  The speeds are from 40-208 BPM. You can select between two modes PENDULUM STEP (Preset values, 40,42,44---88,92,96, etc) or FULL STEP which allows you to change incrementally by one (40, 41, 42---206, 207, 208, etc). Beat tap allows you change the time signature from 0-7 beats and also duplets, triplets, quadruplets and triplets and quadruplets without center beats. It has a 1/8\" mini earphone jack for private use. It is possible to use the metronome and the tuner simultaneously. I bought mine from Austin Bazaar.  Shipping was FREE and FAST. I give it five stars and recommend that you can give it serious consideration."
B000AAGM0M This device functions wonderful but the beeping of the metronome could be a little louder and of a more pleasant tone (sounds like a 1980's video game beep) but I am just being picky. I bought this for my son and he loves it."
B000AAGM0M As an acoustic guitar player, I think this is a great product.I had previously been using the Korg GA-1, which is a fine basic tuner. The GA-1 works like many basic guitar tuners, where you designate the string and it shows you the note in standard tuning (or with one, two, or three flats). But the TM-40 works by just showing the pitch you're currently playing among any of the 12 reference pitches - making alternate tunings and open tunings much simpler.Now I use the TM-40 at home as my main tuner, and the GA-1 rides around in my case. Both great products."
B000AAGM0M Pros: It's a good tuner, it's a good metronome, and it's a great combination package. The flip-out stand on the back makes it easier to see than when it's lying flat. The metronome has excellent selections of different rhythms and is easy to program.Cons: the buttons on the front are raised on top of other raised areas, and it's too easy to accidentally turn the unit on. The tuning sound activated once in my pocket while I was sitting in the audience at a band contest. Also, unlike the CA-30 tuner, this one favors higher notes strongly over bass and makes it difficult to tune low instruments in a noisy environment.Also, it quit working suddenly after about a year. Other people I know who've had this tuner have complained about lack of durability."
B000AAGM0M Works well since I got it. I didn't change battery for more than 6 months."
B000AAGM0M The tuner is perfect for me.  It fits in the guitar case, mandolin case and the dulcimer case.  Just perfect for making those play dates at the Resonance Fair.  Always spot on with the frequency.  Nice product."
B000AAGM0M This metronome is a bit of the big size but there is really nothing like it.. It is so durable filled with options. Very versatile product for the seriousdedicated musician."
B000AAGM0M Tuner works as it should-- almost a little too precisely (it's pretty sensitive).The metronome will drive you crazy.  It has various beats which is a nice touch, but the sounds are horrible.  Think of the most sterile electronic clicks/beeps you can and then add nails-on-chalkboard for good measure.  There are much better sounding metronomes out there.  I bought this Korg for the tuner function and that's about all I'll use it for."
B000AC6DVS Works well - easily keeps my guitars humidified with less maintenance than other humidifiers I've had."
B000AC6DVS Dampit was recommended to me by a guitar instructor years ago, and I have used the standard model for some time. It seemed kind of tricky to get it to hold enough water to humidify the guitar yet still get it dry enough to have absolutely zero drips inside the instrument.I used to hang it by the clip and let it drip dry for about 15 minutes while I was doing other things before placing it in the guitar.Later I wound up trying the Humidipak humidifiers and to help recharge them on a Dreadnought, I took to putting the Dampit in a gallon plastic bag with distilled water and a resealable top, pressing on the sides to saturate it, then rolling it up in a Planet Waves Microfiber polishing cloth and pressing on the end of the cloth to soak it. Then unroll the cloth, put the dampit in under the headstock where a drop of water would just go into the hard shell case, then rolling up the end of the polishing cloth to cover the wet end with dry material and pushing it into the sound hole over the humidipaks. Worked great.So I ordered a super dampit for my new 000 acoustic planning to do the same. They now ship without the clips. Company says they've had too many complaints about scratches, though I didn't seem to have a problem, wasn't about to take a chance with a costly new acquisition. More importantly, there is supposed to be a sponge to absorb water inside the tube and when I pressed on the sides of the tube, it was empty. So I sent it back to Amazon for a refund. No problem getting the refund, but I'm moving on from dampit to try the planet waves insert with a sponge that has eliminated the chance of water dripping in the guitar or damaging the finish.If you use it to soak the polishing cloth as described above, that still works great, but there's really not enough room for that in the OM model, so between that and the missing sponge, will just try something else."
B000AC6DVS If you want to get humidity into a guitar, this product is a must. I works well -- and if one lives in dry area of the country, this is a must have product."
B000AC6DVS Erm, it does what it say it would do. The nice thing about the &#34;super&#34;, is its size, in turn, and its ability to hold more water."
B000AC6DVS Dampit humidifiers have been around for years and years.  I think that I can safely say that the basic design looks to be amazingly similar to what I remember when I saw these for the first time in my university days of the late 1970s.  Generally, Dampits can be used over and over for years.  Sometimes the rubber becomes discolored, sometimes the rubber rips near the end of the Dampit, but basically this is a very workable way to maintain at least a minimum amount of humidity in and around your instrument, something that is especially important during the winter months when artificial heat zaps the humidity out of the air.  This is the first instrument-specific Dampit product that I've ever purchased and it seems to work exceptionally well.  In addition to the standard Dampit, there's a sound-hole cover.  In case it is not clear just how it works, the clear sound-hole cover has a short string with a loop on the end.  You simply attach the Dampit to the loop and it hangs inside the guitar.  My first impression is that it does an excellent job of keeping some needed humidity in the body of the instrument, something very important on a solid-top classical guitar.  I would recommend this over the standard Dampit because the sound-hole cover is so convenient (hopefully it will continue to keep me from having to fish around inside the guitar for a runaway Dampit) and seems to keep the humidity focused in an area that is especially in need of it.  A must have if you keep your acoustic guitar in an environment that gets much below 40-50% humidity."
B000AC6DVS What else is there to say, they are easy to use, they are easy to install and they are easy to check.  I've tried them all and these are the only ones I come back to.  No expensive pads to buy, just use water.  Simple to drop down into the body of guitar, no attempt to fit some rubber block thingy into your sound hole.  Comes out as easy as it goes in.  I have 4 of them.  Love."
B000AC6DVS I live in Arizona and I keep my acoustic in the case with this dampit unless I'm playing it.  It seems to do a good job, although I would recommend purchasing a better meter.  The one it comes with is a simple paper design that gives you a decent estimate."
B000AC6DVS It works well.  This is a classic design that people have used for years and I can see why.  It it isn't broke, don't fix it.The only suggestion I would make is to have a different soundhole cover.  Maybe a sturdy plastic? The soundhole cover that is included is a very cheap, disposable plastic that looks like it was shipped with a cheap trinket.  I think the price is a little high for what it is. Rubber and foam tube?  Why do they charge so much?  I'd like to know the markup."
B000AKSUP2 Recently I switched from a Blackstar HT-5 to a Fender Mustang III V2 amp. Although the Fender is a great sounding amp, you don't get this natural warmth that you get with tubes there's this liveliness that's missing. So, although my cleans sound good, they aren't great. Although my overdrive sounds good... it's not great. Although my distortion... well you get the picture.Since adding this pedal was less expensive than buying a new amp I decided to give it a try. This pedal adds the same kind of sparkle to your sound that you would get from using a clean boost on a tube amp. I believe some people call it &#34;pixie dust&#34; ... that little bit of magic that makes your sound come alive.Interestingly enough, I don't leave this pedal on all the time. But when I stack pedals, or use certain effects like chorus, a shimmer reverb, or any effect with the exception of maybe a leslie... it's pretty awesome.It works different than an EQ... and if you have a tube amp - a clean boost may do the same thing... I think it really adds life to solid state amps."
B000AKSUP2 It's hard to really describe what this pedal does-  It doesn't distort, flange, echo, or produce a chorus.  I'd heard it described as making your amp sound like someone had thrown a blanket off of it.  And because words don't do an accurate job in describing it, I would have probably never pulled the trigger on one (even though they are pretty cheap as pedals go).  As luck would have it, I acquired one on trade, and I have to admit that I agree with the whole blanket euphemism.  This stompbox helps correct the boxy sound of my Blues Jr. when placed at the end of my pedaltrain- right before I run into the amp. I don't feel it needs to be run on a dedicated effects loop to improve an amp's tone, though I do believe it works even better in a loop.  I placed it in the effects loop of both a Palomino V8 (USA/Ampeg made) and a Crate VC508 (a 5 watt USA made EL84 tube amp with Celestian speaker) and it was transformative to both amps' tone (in a great way). It does very well with single coils.  It's a pedal that I would leave on all the time once my tone is dialed in.  I don't think it works as well when I run my LP into a Jet City combo - particularly when trying to coax out subtle textures / harmonics. That amp also lacks an effects loop and I imagine it would have a different effect if placed after the preamp phase.  I guess it's rig dependent, but it's a keeper for what it does to the sound of my Fender."
B000AKSUP2 This is a great pedal to put at the end of your FX chain. I have it as the last on my pedalboard before my GNX4. It's always on & it only took me about a week to settle on how I liked it adjusted. There are only two knobs & I just played around with them untill I was happy with the sound. I do a lot of recording & I also checked the sound after recording. Can't reccomend it enough especially considering the price."
B000AKSUP2 I like it. This is a good pedal for end of line tone adjustments. Like all other pedals, it's not \"The Pedal\" (seems like you always need another one). But it does add to the other pedals in shaping your tone. After you've settle on a setting you like, it adds a subtle, but noticeable addition to your sound."
B000AKSUP2 This pedal essentialy balances out the high, mid, and low frequencies yout instrument produces. I also have the software version of this effect on my DAW. This pedal does a great job of giving your instrument a more balanced and full tone. When I switch it on it allmost sounds like someone took a blanket off my amplifier. I highly recomend this pedal for and and all musicians."
B000AKSUP2 For those of you who are doing jangly pop stuff or real peaky, bitey blues material (think Albert Collins), this will likely add a little, and I mean A LITTLE, extra oomph to your sound. It sounds like it uses a touch of reverb and a dash of the higher end of the mids to make cleans sound more sparkling. But you should also be able to get the same sounds out of a Hughes and Kettner Statesman 40 or 60 watt amp, too, just running it straight.To me, from what I have heard, it adds nothing to those who use a fair amount of distortion in their music. It definitely doesn't add any more fatness. So 
B000AKSUP2 I'm not going to do any explaining about the \"science\" behind how this pedal works. I'm just going to focus this review on how the pedal affects your tone. This definitely isn't a boost, and it's also not an eq, the BBE sonic stomp is a uniquely functioning pedal. To the ear, it serves to add clarity, depth, and body to your tone. Essentially, this pedal allows you to get the most out of the tones your amp is already producing.The lo contour knob doesn't \"increase\" the amount of bass produced by the amp. Rather, it tightens up and generally increases the depth of the bass (and low mid) tone. To the ear this may sound at first like the bass has been increased, but it hasn't. You're just hearing all the bass tone that was there in the first place, that was jumbled up as the signal went from your guitar to the amp.The process knob really just focuses on the treble and high mid frequencies. These frequencies can often be very unpleasant and grating to hear, and the sonic stomp sort of evens and smooths out those tones so they are clearer and less harsh.That's not to say that you can't dial in some very aggressive and cutting highs if you play lead metal or something; indeed, it'll make those searing lead tones even better.Now, I gave this product 4 stars not because I've had any issues with it or haven't been in any way unsatisfied with it; but rather because it's really a fairly subtle effect. At first I almost couldn't tell a difference between having it on and off. With time I've been able to better recognize and appreciate the impact that it has on my tone, but it doesn't make a \"night and day\" difference.I recommend this pedal to someone who already has a tone that you're happy with, and just want to make it even better. This pedal won't make a cheap 15 watt solid- state combo sound like a tube half-stack. It won't make you love your tone when you were completely unsatisfied with it before.In conclusion, though I definitely wouldn't put this pedal into the \"must have\" category, it definitely improves the quality of my tone. This is a pedal that I leave on all the time, as it improves both clean and distorted tones."
B000AKSUP2 This pedal adds that \"I don't know what\" to your sound.I chased a sound for years until buying this pedal - what a difference.If you have great, top quality cable, quiet amps and pedal boards, shielded guitars, fresh tubes - you know the drill - you spend thousands chasing something you hear in your head - then you plug one pedal in and WHAMO!! - there it is!It was THIS pedal for me - just turn the knobs until \"it\" comes out of your speakers.A must have - especially if you are playing clubs, bars or arenas - you have a pedal board - and you are looking for that sound that is gonna finally push your sound out front - give your notes clarity during leads - make overdriven chords ring.I like this pedal - it's on my board - and it's never coming off."
B000AKSUP2 Back in the 90's I used to have an Ampeg guitar head with an effects loop. I discovered the rack version of the BBE in a music store and was amazed by what it did for the money. The amp I have now is a totally bad ass Fryette Deliverance 120, but sadly it has no effects loop. So I thought I was out of luck as far as a BBE goes, because as far as I knew they were only available in rack mount units that could not be placed anywhere but in the effects loop. Then I was looking for pedals on Amazon and, lo and behold, there was a BBE Sonic Maximizer pedal! I snatched it up with a quickness and I am very pleased that it sounds just as good as the rack version. One caveat- if your signal is noisy the BBE can actually increase your signal noise. For this reason I highly recommend using top quality patch and instrument cables and doing all you can to clean up any noisy aspects of your sound before you use it. This pedal is very subtle, but to an audiophile like me it is absolutely essential. It also works great for ANY instrument or sound system. It's also great for vocals as well. But you may want the rack version for those applications. I would also buy the rack version if I had an effects loop to run it through. IMO, the pedal is really only for those folks who have no effects loop but still like what the BBE does. I'd go with the rack just for ease of use and keeping it in the proper place in the signal chain. Plus you can get a stereo rack version and have two BBE's for not much more money that you can use for another application."
B000ARH3M6 I have always loved Hercules products. Their mic stands and guitar stands. They are great quality and very handy, especially this one, for performances where 3 guitars are used."
B000ARH3M6 Sturdily holds three guitars. Fits everything from my bass, to the acoustic or electrics, to the mandolin/ukulele, to the harmonicas in the case.Folds up for transport. Pretty adjustable too.I bought this after buying two of the single guitar stands from Hercules. I also have the trombone and sax/clarinet stand from them. All A+ at reasonable prices."
B000ARH3M6 Apparently one can never have too many guitars, and with this stand you can keep three of them ready for immediate access.  Very stable.  The auto-locking heads rock!  Folds-up pretty compact for travel.  The optional carry bag is a must IMHO."
B000ARH3M6 A real workhorse for sure.  Not too heavy but still very robust and reliable when you are holding up expensive guitars.  I also have the 6 guitar one which is incredibly big ... almost too big but still easy to use once you get the hang of it."
B000ARH3M6 I've had this stand for about 5 years and have used it on stage for the last 3 years pretty steady.  The first thing that broke was the piece that keeps that upper shaft from pulling all the way out of the base when you extend it - the disclaimer here is that it was very cold and I immediately extended it to the maximum point always letting it hit the collar to stop it. It's plastic; Plastic and cold don't mix - The retainer piece broke and went flying and I was standing there with my guitar stand in two pieces right before a gig.  I managed to get it back together but now I have to be very careful when extending the neck. The other part that I've been having problems with is the upper collar that mounts to the top of the stand and holds the guitar necks.  It has come up completely off and I must continually tighten that hex screw to prevent the top from falling off.  I won't mark this stand less then 4 stars even with those issues because it really is a great stand.  Another person noted to pay attention to your guitar dimensions, which is very good advice.  Long bass guitars end up resting on the bottom leg of the tripod."
B000ARH3M6 This is my 2nd Hercules Stand. Great stand for managing multiple guitars. Does not fair well when stored in non cooled area. The handle gets real sticky and causes problems. I have a friend who also experienced the same problem. So keep it stored in climate controlled area and it is a great stand."
B000ARH3M6 Just got my stand today... the QUICKEST delivery EVER with the Super Savings free shipping selected that I have ever experienced!  Go go, Amazon!  lulz  Anyhoo, I have two banjos and a mandolin that I purchased this for.  I looked about for quite a bit at various sites, reviews, prices, etc, and pretty much Hercules got the best reviews everywhere (although admittedly I hadn't really wanted to shell out over 50 dollars).  Yet this tri-stand really looked good with a solid general review, and I am rather tight for spa
B000ARH3M6 If you are like me and truly value your (usually) expensive prized instruments, then you want to make sure nothing happens to them, accidentally or otherwise. The Hercules stands are much much more stable than all the rest. They have a better base design, and even when the stand inevitably gets bumped there is no wobbling, no worries - just make sure you lower it all the way, as it is designed to be.These things are awesome. Also, everything fits so perfectly on Hercules stands. All of the other tri-stands lean your instruments in toward the top too much and cause the headstocks to bang together. Not here, plenty of room for everything now. This stand (and the double version which I also own) lets your gear hang down perfectly straight and protects it all with those very thickly padded stops you see near the base in the picture. Also, the hanging gravity grasp around the neck is so sweet. With all other stands I am always worried that my guitar will slide off, or if it gets bumped that it could fall out. This mechanism holds it tight until you want it, and releases it very easily and naturally for you, but will not let it go while it's just sitting there. Check these things out, you will not be disappointed.Also, as for durability, I have used and abused my Hercules stand for years, tossing it around my car to play at different places. It's been tossed, dropped, setup and stowed many times and it still looks and works just like it did when I first bought it. It doesn't even have any obvious visible scratches on it (it came with a bag but I discarded it and never used it). Meanwhile, I had gone thru dozens of regular cheapo stands over the years before I bought the Herc. I will only every buy Herc stands from now on."
B000B6DHAS This is one of the cleanest sounding mini-amps you'll find.  Mine has no hiss or noise through the headphones.  It uses JFET components which get close to a tube amp sound.  It does sound tinny through the 2\" speaker, but AM radio sounded just as bad through 2\" speakers.  I hated it at first until I plugged in a set of headphones and turned down the O. Drive knob.  Very clean but I could get some character out of it by tweaking the guitar's volume knob.  Turning the O.Drive knob up just a bit adds some sparkle.  Of course you can get really distorted sounds from the amp.  I'm building a speaker cab with a Jensen 6\" speaker just for this amp.  According to many reports it will drive a 1x12 cab."
B000B6DHAS This tiny little amp is great for practicing outside or in a canoe or while hang gliding.  But it is not very good at parties.  it cannot compete with the noise level that 20 people in conversation can make.  It is cheap, so you should just get one.  I am having great fun experimenting around with different settings, instruments, and power feed voltage levels.  (see the danelectro power supply for this thing, really cool!)"
B000B6DHAS This little amp is exactly what my son needed for his acoustic guitar's output while playing outside on the porch. The amp produces a much \"bigger\" sound with much better quality than expected. This does eat up 9v batteries so we also picked up an AC power adapter for when he uses this in the houses.We also like that this has a headphone jack, which cuts the sound to the speaker when plugged in.Highly Recommend! Note: We have the \"Burgundy\" color one.CFH"
B000B6DHAS This is 10 watt walkman size guitar amplifier. The controls are Volume/ off, Tone, and overdrive. It also has a headphone jack. In my honest opinion, it is a good headphone amplifier to use when to need to practice without disturbing people around you. The speaker sound is fine for a clean sound ( like jazz, or country) or semi distorted and more (rock). If your looking for an small amp. that will do metal this may not be for you. Defintely get the Danelectro DA-1 AC power adapter instead of batteries because you may go through them quick. Overall it's pretty good."
B000B6DHAS If you are getting this amp only for portable practice and just want to hear what you are playing and do not care if it sounds great then you will be happy with this little amp.  It sounds surprisingly good for twenty bucks. I said good, not loud.  Loud enough, yes. I suggest buying a power brick so you can plug it in for daily home use because the batteries only last for about five hours of playing time.  This is a great little amp for camping, a quick lesson, or going to a friends house for a little jamming etc.. If you keep your expectations reasonable you will be pleased.  Great color and retro style as well."
B000B6DHAS i have been a gigging guitarist for over 50 years now.i own all the coveted amps/guitars/fxfor the last few years i have been doing an outside gig on the weekends in a small mountain tourist town.i've used all the roland cubes that are battery powered.they were just fine.on a lark, i bought this danelectro honeytone. i'd read some good reviews and $20.00 isnt much money.i was shocked. going guitar straight into the amp produces great clean and od tones. but in my gig i have been using a boss me-25 with all my presets for my set plus a boss rc-2 looper and lastly, my phone with all my backing tracks. i play rythm, leads and sing in my gig.i connected all this to the single input of the n-10, put volume 1/2 and tone the same. od turned off. the sound is rich, full and IMHO sounds just as good as my roland cube street ($299.00).i have all the volume i need and great tone. the 9v battery lasts the entire 2 hr set.i am AMAZED by this amp."
B000B6DHAS I use this amp for playing in my small apartment and it works great. The clean and distortion channels both sound good paired with the Danelectro Model 59 M."
B000B6DHAS After reading numerous reviews talking about the exceptional volume and tone of this amp, for the price (about $16-$17) I had to try it.When I plugged my acoustic into this, I was very pleased to find those reviews are accurate.  First, let's not expect $500 double 16&#34; sound from a portable 9v amp.  Once that reality is recognized, it's realized this puts out far better sound than one would ever expect from an amp this size and price.I would note that the sound you get out of this amp-- as with any amp-- will be directly relational to the quality of guitar and pickup you're feeding from.  I tried this on three different guitars and each one sounded significantly different.  One had very rich tone, another sounded &#34;tinny&#34;, another had a passive pickup and required I turn the HoneyTune up quite a bit more than the one with active pickup.  So it won't sound the same on every guitar.That said, if your guitar has good tone and your pickup is good, this amp is simply awesome.  I've had it only one day so I haven't put it through the test of time... but first-impressions are that I will buy more of these in the future (I need more than one portable amp).My sister visited and heard it right after I opened the box, and she was impressed as well.  Neither of us expected this kind of sound from such a small amp.  And I have to say, the aqua color is major retro.  Gotta luv it.I've been looking for &#34;the&#34; portable amp for some time.  This is the best I've found to date and the value for price is a perfect balance. I don't know as I'd pay the $40-$50 for this guitar shops often ask, but the Amazon price is perfect. : )One last thing:  Danelectro branded 9v battery included, same color as the amp. Priceless."
B000B6DHAS The Danelectro mini amp was an impulse buy for me, but this thing is fantastic! clean tones to woodstock fuzz, this thing belts 'em out. only complaint- battery doesn't last too long. get a power adapter. otherwise- GREAT PRACTICE AMP!"
B000B6DHB2 This little amp kicks major ass, dood. I think I may have blown the speaker or it's just how it sounds but it's great for a lo-fi kind of fuzz-e tone when the gain and levels are all the way up. The clean tone is really nice too, a little to bright for my taste, but for a mini-clip amp it's not too bad. I can take this plus my tele to my friends house and sit outside and just didtle away. Theres a headphon jack, a 9v power supply and that's in for plug ins, No line in so you can't plug you ipod or whatever to it and play along but oh well. If you have a big rig and you just want something small for like a camping trip with some friends this is pretty great."
B000B6DHB2 the mini amp did not arrive with the battery as it was stated in literature. good thing I had purchased the 9volt power adapter. I was really surprised at the output considering how small the speaker size. ideal for kicking aound house and small partyof friends. should already come with 9volt adapter with along cord. it would be worth the increase in price to have it come altogether. would purchase again,"
B000B6DHB2 TheDanelectro Honeytone Mini Amp - Beatnik Burgundyis an easy way to get great sound from your electric guitar. The color of this unit is a soft burgundy (almost brick red in color). Paired with the Zero Hum AC Adaptor, it's a highly portable amp setup. \"Ultra-portable\" by using a 9V battery instead of the AC adaptor. I do think they are best purchased together to enjoy all the benefits of this rig though.A headphone jack on the amp means you can enjoy the amp's impressive sound quality without bothering the neighbors or waking your spouse.Included with the amp is an Owner's Manual with simple start-up instructions. You'll need to have your own cord (the one that goes from the guitar to the amp isn't provided as part of the amp package...). The manual has several control settings for the following sound tweaks:-Clean & Spanky-Warm Jazz-Big Amp Overdrive-Killer Blues-Distorted Rhythm-Thick Solo-Woodstock Fuzz-Send the Cats Under the Bed-Twang-Mondo Sustain-Brit Solo Tune-Sparkle Clean-Early 80's Clean Solo-Late 60's Neck Solo-70's Brit-70's SoloI paid under $20 for this amp and couldn't be happier with the product. Don't hesitate to pick one up for yourself.UPDATE: 7/19/12There is a space in the back of the unit for 1 9-volt batteryDuracell 9-V Alkaline Batteries, 4-Countor you can use the included AC adapter to power the amp.UPDATE: 9/19/12 Per reviewer Paul Stewart: \"As a point of clarity - the current version of this item does NOT ship with an adapter nor cable. Be prepared to purchase these in tandem.\"  FYI...UPDATE: 11/17/13Almost 4 years ago I bought this item, and it's still going strong!  Great deal.UPDATE: 7/11/14YUP!  It's still kickin' along. Super buy on this mini-amp."
B000B6DHB2 Look, it's a plastic box that's just 5.5&#34; square and 2.5&#34; deep, with a cheap three-inch speaker inside. It produces decent sound, although there's substantial background hiss and it has a nasty habit of picking up digital &#34;static&#34; from my computer. It's OK as a practice amp, but I certainly wouldn't want to perform with it. In short, it's only a small step above toy level, which is what you'd expect for a twenty-dollar amp. That doesn't mean it's not useful, but you need to be realistic about what you're getting here."
B000B6DHB2 Brough this for trying \"electric\" feels on the acoustic guitar, and don't want to waste too much money on electric acoustic (preamp) guitar or big amp if I don't like the \"eFeels\". After researching awhile and reading tons of good reveiws of it, I decided to give it a try.  I didn't expect too much on $20 amp, but surprisingly, it positively gives me more than I ask for.  I also brough it with the adaptor, which is great to save $$ for long runs, and I don't have to worry about the battery for home practices.  It is adorable out of the box; it looks like a lovely toy, but it works professionally based on its 10w amp.  I don't care much about the manufactor's suggested modes, basically, I just fool around with the three button controls to whatever sounds I like in different songs on guitar / uke.  I like the small size that won't take too much space on my tiny room, it's cute to look at, and it is practical too!I had the high frequence of feedback as one of the reviwers when I used a poor pickup; however, when I changed to another one, I can turn the volume as high as I want with the same direction and setup as the previous poor pickup.  I almost thought that was an issue from the amp, luckily, I have two different pickups to try it deeply.  After using the better pickup, the amp doesn't have any issue yet.  I have used for few times, so I don't know about its longevity yet!One more thing about the headphone mode that is not completely silent because the guitar's sound itself won't be muted, but the headphone does mute the effected sounds from the amp; anyway, it's a great feature to have."
B000B6DHB2 I own one of these amps and it is capable of everything from very clean to heavy over-drive. I love it. It's got tone galore! I play either a Martin A/E thru it or a Strat knock-off.  Either one sounds awesome.  Never dreamed of such an enjoyable little amp, let alone for $20. Battery life seems OK, but I hate messing with batteries, so I'd buy power supply (you can get a 9V supply (check for proper polarity) at the Thrift store for a buck).  Don't even think about it.  Get it.  $20 is pocket change."
B000B6DHB2 This little amp is exactly what my son needed for his acoustic guitar's output while playing outside on the porch. The amp produces a much \"bigger\" sound with much better quality than expected. This does eat up 9v batteries so we also picked up an AC power adapter for when he uses this in the houses.We also like that this has a headphone jack, which cuts the sound to the speaker when plugged in.Highly Recommend!CFH"
B000B6DHB2 i knew it would be small but i wasn't thinking this small, ,it shore is cute,, good enough for now ,but not for the long-run,, shore its loud for the size but, it rattles when you turn it up and amps slides  from vibration,,if you keep it on lower sound its fine, this is only for temporary use for me. its an ok tiny mini little amp  (for it's size its good,) don't exspect a fender amp thats all,"
B000B6DHB2 For $20 you can't go wrong. Its a lot of fun to use this little amp for practice and it goes anywhere."
B000B6DHB2 Based on other reviews, I made my purchase. This is a great unit, it sounds good and loud enough.Two downsides, both are about the noise.1. I live on the 4th floor. As long as I turn the volume up, it acts like a radio.. I mean very loud radio background and I couldn't get ride of it. This is the only thing that annoys me, but I think it depends on where people live.2. When this is not properly tuned, it sounds strange and makes a lot of noise. (Other than the radio part.)None of these are major issues, as a mini amp you can't really expect that much, not to mention it's not expensive at all. Overall I like it and I would recommend it.By the way, this unit comes with a 9V battery."
B000B6DHB2 I got this when I was just learning how to play guitar.  I was using a borrowed First Act guitar without any amp and I wanted to see what kind of sounds I could make.  It was inexpensive and fun to use.  The sound quality isn't the greatest, but that's to be expected.  You can dial in quite a few different sounds and it comes with a sheet showing you how to make different sounds.  It's very light so make sure you set it on the floor because you will be pulling it over with the guitar cable.  I pulled it off the table a couple of times with no ill effects, but I wouldn't want to take any chances."
B000B6DHB2 this is the perfect amp for bed practice! i just plug near to me and practice when i like to practice, no heavy amps to move just plug and chill , not a great sound but is for practice not for concerts!nice item good purchase"
B000B6DHB2 Bought this for my son. Its perfect for practice. Great portability. Has a nice clean sound, as well as a decent overdrive sound. Sounds great with an electric acoustic. Its surprisingly loud for a small amp. You can't beat the price. I highly recommend this!"
B000B6DHB2 Sounds a lot more than what you expect, this is my 2nd Honeytone (one at home, one at work).  You can use it with batteries or with a 9V adapter, it has a clip to hang it on your belt or wherever you want, it also has a headphones input.  It gets way to distorted at high volume, but come on... it's a $20 amp; it does what it has to and does it well."
B000B6DHB2 This is a fun little practice amp about the size of a large sandwich. Three knobs, volume, tone and gain give it a little versatility. Runs forever on a nine-volt battery. I keep mine next to the couch so I can always plug in and have some fun. It's small but it can also be quite loud of you want it to be.Overall a great little deal for the price. Stop waiting and grab one, you can't go wrong."
B000B6DHB2 It's not going to win any awards for sound quality, but it sure is cute.  As you might expect, it's a pretty boxy sounding little amp, more reminiscent of 60's portable transistor radios than a double stack Marshall.  But it did the two things I wanted it for.  First, it has a belt clip, which I can attach to my belt or a guitar strap.  Second, it has a headphone out, so I can plug in a set of ear buds (1/8&#34; stereo jack).  You can get it to a clean decent practice room level if you keep the drive control set at minimum.  Surprisingly, the Drive control works it's way in gradually, letting you control the distortion a bit with the guitar volume control. With the drive control cranked up, you can get the amp unexpectedly loud, but terribly distorted.  For something you can throw in your guitar gig bag and take with you wherever you go, it's not too bad.  With a set of earphones, I would put it on par with some of the more expensive amp-jacks that are available.  If you plan to use it as a practice amp and you're not moving about, I would recommend getting a power supply (will use the same ones as most effects pedals).  Battery life appears to be around 3~5 hours, but the performance starts degrading at about an hour's use."
B000B6DHB2 I use this for a bass, and while I cannot get deep tones, it is great to take to the beachor play with my acoustic guitar friends.  Tip:  it sounds better if you don't cramp it all the way up - stop at 90%."
B000B6DHB2 I wanted a portable small sized amp for using my electric guitar outdoors -- but was not really in a position to pay the big dollars for one of the high end brands. There is of course, very little bass response with this one and it is a tad tinny, but hey, it's just a 9 volt battery. I just wanted the guitar audible for practicing outside and this is a very neat little device. They put a lot of thought into this amp, and it is outstanding for the budget price. Keep in mind, you can patch another 9 volt powered device through this one to enhance it -- I will at some point run my Boss Digital Delay box through it to check that out. The belt clip on the back and triple adjustment dials are nice, and I got it in red as a change of pace, because I always get &#34;black&#34; with my equipment. It looks very nice and the vintage front design gives it a lot of character. Nice product, Danelectro."
B000B6DHB2 I bought this amp as a back up for my 9 year old son and to take to the park... This is a nice little amp, it sounds prety good for the price. Just dont expect a booming base or grand sound from it."
B000B6DHB2 I buy and sell electric guitars and often I meet with someone at a half-way point where access to electricity is unavailable. I was surprised at the volume and tone that came out of a unit so small.  There is even and overdrive which makes this totally cool as some of my customers want to schredd a little.  This is battery operated but can be plugged in using an adapter.  I bought a Planet Waves 9V Power adapter to go with the Honey Tone.  It might work in a Busker situation."
B000B6DHB2 Don't get me wrong...this is a great little amp for practicing...but it eats batteries like they were candy. I think it was like 2 or three hours of playing and I had to throw in new batteries. But if playing on the street corner is your thing...this little amp has a belt clip."
B000B6DHB2 Ok I've owned 2 of these Danelectro amps. For one they are cheap in price, loud in output, and can be used as external speakers when attached to computers via wired or with purchase of a cheap Bluetooth adapter from ebay or amazon. Recently I purchased this item on ebay for $10 - Bluetooth Audio Music Receiver V3.0 Wireless Stereo Adapter For Smart PhonesNow I can connect to my tablets, smartphones, and computers and use this amp as a great external Bluetooth speaker.  Plus the battery life is great. Try to buy a BT speaker on amazon with this wattage that's cordless and works from battery power, and you will spend well over $200.The included battery is worthless and dies in about 5 minutes. I installed a 550mah rechargeable 9v battery (ebay) and it lasts forever.Plus I can still use it as a lower quality jam amp when I want... for this price its hard to beat."
B000B6DHB2 This micro amp is a real blast in more ways than one. And it is NOT a toy. Don't be misled by the price--this is a real amp based on stompbox electronics, and while it may not be a Marshall stack, it is more than adequate as a highly portable practice amp as well as a performance amp for small spaces. It is certainly loud hough to evoke complaints from my neighbors in adjoining apartments.I bought this amp for use durng harmonica practice. To this end, I use the belt clip to mount it on my hip. Then I just patch in my mike, twiddle the controls, and go to town. The tone has been fairly pure although, with a mike at least, I can also get some pops, crackles, and squeals. This is pretty typical for anyone amping a harp, so the Honey Tone is not at fault. In general, this amp is pretty forgiving of the input. I've used it with a high-impedance mike (Astatic JT-30), a low-impedance mike (Behringer XM8500), and electric guitar (Fender Stratocaster). It handles these without noticeable signal loss.What is this amp exactly? My guess is that Danelectric took the circuitry for its overdrive stompbox, added a 1-watt amplifier circuit, and put the whole shebang into a retro case. The result is quite appealing. And t
B000B6DHB2 I cant tell you how impressed i am with this mini amp, I was expecting some little amp with a somewhat of a sound, Instead I couldn't put it away, I must have played for at least a couple of hours in complete awe, The tones you were able to achieve with just a little knob adjustment was amazing,I would recommend this to anyone that needs a cheap amp, The 9v battery holds up well (which is surprising considering the drive you got off it)So spend the $20.00 and get something that is a real deal, I hope this helps with your decision about purchasing one"
B000B6DHB2 I wanted to like this. I really did. The idea of an amp this portable and cheap just made me think, &#34;Perfect&#34;. However, the unit I received was cr@p, and I'm going to assume it was defective and not blanket all the positive reviews with dispersions. The one I got kept cutting in and out. You might be playing a solo line and you might hear about 75% of the notes or something. And when holding a chord, the sustained sound would cut out after a few seconds. Frustrating.I did weigh whether or not to try a replacement unit. The so-so sound a
B000B6DHB2 I've tried several &#34;portable amps&#34;.  For the price, the HoneyTone can't be beat.  It has volume, tone and overdrive knobs (the overdrive can go way too over, so easy on that one).  Comes with a battery but can be connected to a 9v adapter (important note: reverse polarity, negative central).  Interestingly I have found this amp seems to work significantly better with acoustic-electrics or piezo-based pickups better than magnetic pickups.  But for a small, portable, light-weight practice amp which one can hook to a belt and attach an earphone... they don't come much better.  It has a belt clip on the back but you'll have to supply your own earphones and 9v adapter if you want them.  Battery is included. Of course a guitar cable is a required extra.Well worth the money."
B000B6FBA2 I'm giving this one 5 stars, with the caveat that you MUST GET THE SILVER ALUMINUM one, otherwise the black thermoplastic ones do break. The thermoplastic ones broke on me within 2-3 months of use, 3 different ones, until I got the silver one which has not had that problem. Every music store I go to locally has the black thermoplastic ones, and they look in disbelief at me when I say they break. But they did --if I leave it on the guitar on a fret for 5 or 10 minutes and go into the kitchen to make tea, the thing literally snaps and breaks into 2 or 3 pieces and goes airborne at high speed in 2 pieces, and could poke someone's eye out in a public performance, freaky. There's something about the rainy days higher humidity cool damp air pressure and/or temperature fluctuation that does it.I live in northern california, so I don't know if a dry climate like the southwest would not have that problem.The SILVER ALUMINUM ONE by contrast, hasn't broken in now nearly a year of use, and shows no hints of doing that. It feels different in the hand from the thermoplastic-- no hint of plastic, but it is very light and not heavy like the G7 ones are. I made sure to order the silver aluminum one through Amazon, since the description on the black ones say some are aluminum and some thermoplastic, and I only want to make sure I get the aluminum one.The silver aluminum Planet Waves capo really is the best capo I've ever had, super easy to use, very easy to put on and switch from one fret to another while you're going from playing one song to another (you don't have move your body or the guitar like you do with all other capos to put it on or move it, which is a spectacular design), it keeps the strings in tune better than most other capos, and it's out of the way of your hands, doesn't interfere when you play any chord. The screw adjustment is in the perfect place for the least strain and doesn't hurt the fingers when turning it. It's the least obtrusive and best capo ever. I'll also add that I have an old carpal injury so I want the least strain, and small hands, so I want the least awkward and most light capo, and this does that. I absolutely love it, and I'm glad that the aluminum ones are durable."
B000B6FBA2 Nice design... Small, lightweight and very easy to use, dose the job well. I am thinking about getting a 2nd one."
B000B6FBA2 This inexpensive capo works as advertised. It's the plastic version of the more expensive metal one but it works as advertised and is ideal for a light weight backup."
B000B6FBA2 I'm happy with this purchase. I bought it during the Black Friday sale. It works for what I use it for. When not in use, it just gets put away. Doesn't take a lot of space."
B000B6FBA2 Purchased this capo after having a bad experience with a spring style capo.  This capo was just perfect for my needs."
B000B6FBA2 In 40 years I have had every kind of capo out there. This is the right one. This one works. Buy one for each of your guitars and keep them in the case: they are well made and inexpensive enough."
B000B6FBA2 It is really good to have one of this to change the tone of the songs to make it easy to play!"
B000B6FBA2 It does a good job for it's primary purpose as a capo so I gave it four stars.  It works flawlessly, but the one minor annoyance is that it doesn't easily stay on the head of the guitar except above the nut where if you screw it a bit tight it could mess with the tuning of the guitar.  With clamp on capos you can just clamp them on the wood."
B000B6FBA2 Pretty darn good in every way. Trim and easy to use. Solid construction. I recommend this capo without reservation. I like it and it is small."
B000B6FBA2 This is a fantastic little capo.  I say little because it is not as big as the spring loaded type, of the Shubb capos I've used.It has a low profile, and I can reach right up to it and still play well.It seems to be sturdy and well constructed, and I love that I can easily adjust how much tension to put on the strings.  Just enough so they don't buzz and then the strings will stay in tune when the capo is off.Much cheaper than the G7th, and does the job just as well in my opinion.For everyone saying that you can't fit it on the neck, make sure you get the right capo!  If you have a classical guitar, get a classical capo!  If you have a guitar with a really thin neck get the lite model capo.  If you are like most people who have regular size guitar necks, get the normal one.Don't write bad reviews of the product because you bought the wrong kind."
B000B6FBA2 I love this capo better than any I have seen or used. Great quality and price. You wont go wrong with this capo."
B000B6FBA2 I don't have a classical guitar, but I just got an inexpensive but really fun steel string guitar with a non-radiused fingerboard.  I've also got over a dozen capos (don't ask!) but all are for radiused fingerboards.The fingerboards of most steel-string guitars--electric and acoustic--are radiused, that is, they are not flat.  They have a gentle curve to them, so gentle that many wouldn't notice it unless they looked closely. Look up \"fingerboard\" in the Wikipedia for an excellent discussion and Google images for diagrams and pictures.Even though the curve is gentle, if a fingerboard is radiused, a capo must be curved, too, or the outside strings would not be pressed down properly and would buzz.  If a fingerboard is flat, like a classical guitar's, the capo must be flat, too, or the center strings will not be pressed down properly and will buzz.If you're not sure whether your guitar's fingerboard is radiused, slide a ruler between two frets.  If it lies flat, then so is the fingerboard.  If it rocks, the fingerboard is radiused.I REALLY like this capo because of the way pressure is adjusted by turning the tension screw.  This makes it possible to exert just the right amount of pressure--not tool little, which would cause strings to buzz, and not too much, which would cause the instrument to go out of tune.As others have noted, its one drawback is that it can't be clamped to the headstock when not in use.  But for that, I'd replace most of my capos with radiused versions of this capo.  HIGHLY recommended!"
B000B6FBA2 My eleven year old guitar player is very happy with this capo. It's easy for him to use and adjust."
B000B6FBA2 Love this capo on my electric guitar.  I can adjust the tension for any position on the neck very easily.  Tried other more expensive capos, but this one is the Winner!"
B000B6FBA2 In this price point - it's a good capo - if you know how to put one on and use it. I use it for lessons in case a kid steals it - so I'm not losing my G7 capo which was $40. Great capo."
B000B6FBA2 The only instrument this works well on is my Yamaha guitarelele which has nylon strings, for steel strings I want more pressure, I advise getting the NS Capo that is not \"lite\",  I prefer that one above this model."
B000B6FBA2 You have to turn the knobs every time you want to use this. What a pain. Oh well, it was cheap enough to have around."
B000B6FBA2 This is an awesome capo!  It's sleek, light,easy to install (you can do it with one hand) and looks nice on the instrument.  I use the NS capo on my Gibson SG Special faded and it does exactly what it is supposed to do.  I love the dial, it's very easy to use and lets me set it to the just the right amount of pressure where I can still bend the strings but there is no fret buzz.  Awesome product, much better than using a Kyser that puts your guitar out of tune and leaves gouges in your neck.  Sounds great on my SG and my acoustic.For those of you wondering yes it does clamp on the headstock if you tighten it down enough.  I think it also depends on the width of your headstock but it works for me."
B000B6FBA2 There's nothing not to like about this capo.  I have two of them.  I've played guitar for over 40 years and have used other types of capos.  I like this one's low profile and the fact that you provide the pressure to the fretboard (by turning a knob to tighten it) rather than rely on a spring, as on the clip-on type. It takes a few seconds longer to install than the clip-on type, but I like the results better."
B000B6FBA2 Was not sure about this one but it is darn easy to use and works quite well.  I still use the Kayser for most stuff but this is great for a backup."
B000B6FBA2 We ordered one, it worked so nicely, we ordered 2 more.  You can adjust the tension precisely to fit your guitar, and minimize string stress and de-tuning each time you move your capo.  Very nice product."
B000B6FBA2 This is a very nice product to use.  I would recommend it to anyone. It is small enough to be out of the way while playing."
B000B6FBA2 Great item!Sturdy, had it for a few weeks now. Small, light, durable. Holds the strings down perfectly too Great capo!"
B000B6FBA2 These are nice, easy to use capos and the price was great.  I got several of them to use during my guitar class, when someone doesn't have a capo and needs one."
B000B6FBA2 Works well, arrived fast. No problems. Works as described. A good purchase for a low priced capo.Works for acoustic and electric"
B000B6FBA2 I purchased a Classical guitar and only had a traditional (steel string) Capo available to me. Not thinking it through I used it on my Nylon Stings and after a few times I realized it had damaged the string to the point they had to be replaced. Along with my string order I added this Capo so it does not happen again.Pros:It's small and lightweight.It's very well made. It not  only looks great but also appear to be of high quality.It's very adjustable. Unlike my steel string Capo, this uses a screw/knob to tighten, not spring loaded. This allows you to finely tune the capo to add just enough pressure to bar the fret but not damage the stings.It works on steel strings. Yep, I found my self needing a Capo on another guitar and only having this with me, I saw no reason it should not work so I gave it a try and it performed wonderfully. I won't be using it full time on my steel strings, but great to know in a pinch I have use it.If you need a great capo thats gentle on your Nylon strings then this is the one to get."
B000B6FBA2 I always seem to have to re-tune with the spring loaded capo's.  Rarely have to re tune with this one.  Highly recommend."
B000B6FBA2 I ordered one of these because I like my other Planet Waves Capo a lot (I believe its the older metal version of this, not the &#34;Lite&#34;). However, this one just does not screw down enough to hold down the strings, especially down at the lower frets where the neck is a little thinner (on a Martin jumbo acoustic). It will barely bend the strings down behind the fret but not enough to prevent buzzing. Your fretting hand will naturally push the capo back and out of position quite easily when playing open chords too.I'm not sure why the plastic version has this issue when it appears to have an identical design to the old metal one. It doesn't seem defective as no parts are bent or missing as far as I can tell. Unless I just happen to get one with a shorter than normal screw, I wouldn't recommend it for any guitar without a thick neck.My recommendation is the classic Kyser capo thats more dependable and quicker to apply and remove (it also attaches to your headstock effortlessly when not in use). If you are looking for the screw-down style, I would look for the older version of this and avoid the &#34;Lite&#34;."
B000BBRZ3S A Little History:I have been a guitar player for forty-odd (some of them, VERY odd) years.  For the first thirty of them, I tuned by ear - starting by guessing at what a low E sounded like, then tuning the other five strings by fretting, listening and tuning.  I could never understand why the tuning often sounded perfect for one chord, yet remained `off' for others... it took quite a long time to get it right.  Then, about ten years ago, I thought I had figured it out.  The problem (I thought) was that my guesses at a true \"E\" were off - so I got myself an \"E\" tuning fork (320 cycles) and used it to tune the first string.  Then, I did as I had always done - fretted and tuned the other five. Not much better as a result - kept having to tune and retune for quite a while to get all chords to sound right.  During those years, I tried tuning all six strings to (what I believed was an accurately tuned) piano as well as by ear to tones available online.  Nothing gave me better tuning on the first try.  Then, I saw an ad for a Chromatic Tuner and lightening struck.The Realization:There have been many -  each of which has led me closer to what I have now - near perfect tuning on the first go `round!  First off, I realized that when we say \"E\", that is not just one note.  It is a range of literally hundreds - perhaps even thousands- of specific tones.  The same is true for every note.  This is akin, I guess, to the realization as a child, that no matter how many shades of `blue' are in a box of crayons, the chanced of having the precise shade you want for a specific drawing are rare.  Purchasing my first Chromatic Tuner (a CT440, manufactured by SwitchMucic and sold through MusiciansFriend.com) moved me a long way along the continuum of learning and accurate tuning.  However, that tuner had at least two limitations. Firstly, it's construction is rather light and flimsy - it works OK, but has a second limitation that conaused me to buy the Korg (for about the same price)  That is that the Korg has a built in tone generator and speaker allowing the option of tuning that way rather than having only the single option of having tones made by the instrument read and metered back to you.  Both tuners have plug-in for electric instruments, and, so far as I can tell, their accuracies are similar.  I prefer the Korg for the reasons I have mentioned.  Additionally, the Korg can be manually recalibrated for special tuning needs - and `remembers' the original tuning/tones so you can return to it for more `standard' usage. A nice, extra piece of flexibility. The LCD meter is easy to read and colored lights tell you, right away, whether you are sharp, flat (and by how much!) or right on!As a point of surprising interest, the tuning fork I had used for years turns out to be profoundly FLAT! A shock to me - given that I had grown up learning that tuning forks gave off perfect tones! I have saved it as a reminder that all things are not what they are promoted to be. I guess the round pitch pipe that Ms. Sweeny used to tune up the class in the 5th grade was probably not quite as precise as she would have presumed!And Finally:This is a marvelous little (and inexpensive) device - well constructed, accurate and flexible to allow for many different tuning need situations and circumstances.  I assume that there will be still higher places for my `learning curve' in this area to rise to - but for right now, this is it.  I am using it, regularly, on all my stringed instruments (two six-string Martins, a twelve string Epiphone and a frailing banjo.  The time it saves tuning the 12-string alone makes it more than it's own price!)If you have not discovered Chromatic Tuning (maybe I really WAS the last one to discover these things!?), I suggest you do so immediately and spend your time enjoying the pleasures of making music rather than sitting in frustration trying to adjust the tunings by ear so it sounds `really' right. Perhaps people with `perfect pitch' can do very nicely without a Chromatic Tuner - I am not one of them. Are you?"
B000BBRZ3S It is inexpensive but is difficult to use  anywhere with other noise..I used it for several years but it is only a backup now.. Nice part is that you can calibrate the tuning, although probably would not be used by most musicians.. Other than that I think money would be better spent on a headstock type tuner.. I would not recommend it."
B000BBRZ3S This is a nice little tuner. It is small, easy to read and use. It has a non-backlit LCD display of an analog VU style meter, with extra marks at plus and minus 20 cents, and red LEDs that light when a tone is sharp or flat. It has a green LED and large mark for being on target. It has a built-in mic for acoustic instruments, and a mono 1/4 inch phone jack for electric instruments. It has an active tone you can switch on for tuning, but that is only adjustable over the narrow range of 410-480hz. It uses a pair of AAA size batteries that you pop the whole case open to change. If you have any vision problems, the display might be an issue. The LCD is about 1 1/2 inches long and 3/4 of an inch high, and, like all non-backlit LCD displays, has a narrow viewing angle and reflection issues.I wanted this for tuning didgeridus that I was making, and it works adequately for that. The one thing it is lacking that disappointed me is a frequency or octave readout. As it is, it gives you the note and cents sharp or flat, but does not give an octave number or frequency of the sound. So, you know you are tuned to a C, you just don't know exactly which C it is. Probably not much of an issue if you are tuning a regular instrument, but in some cases would be very handy to know. I suppose with more training and experience, I could learn to tell that by ear. (What? Learn a skill! Isn't that asking a bit much?)I suppose for an inexpensive tuner, that is the trade-off, but it does detract from the usefulness of this tuner for my purposes. Other than that, it seems to work well. It is consistent, easy to use, and compact. I consider it about average in value - it does the basics well but is missing what I consider an important function in such a device. I may be expecting too much for the price, as I have not done an exhaustive study of tuners and their specs. Having the octave feature would make it 4 stars for me instead of three.In any case, if you don't need to know the actual octave or frequency but just the accuracy of the notes you are tuning, this works quite well, and is not very expensive."
B000BBRZ3S What can I really say! Tunes my entire arsenal.From. Cigar Box Guitar, 3 string Strummers, Tacoma Papoose, andmy brand new Laguna 6 string..Getting ready to make few Uke's and it will Tune them also..Need a all n one Tuner, buy this or an I-Phone? The Korg is the perfectTuner.."
B000BBRZ3S I've had two of these tuners. They are well known among bass instrument players for being able to lock in on the lowest pitches better than most other tuners. They're durable and have a long battery life. Unlike most other tuners, in noisy environments they don't lock in on higher pitches before lower ones, again a plus for low instrument players.The one problem that I've had with these tuners is that one of them had to be set to A-439 to tune pitches that other tuners recognized as A=440. Strange."
B000BBRZ3S this tuner is easy to use.  I like that it has the input jack for electric guitar as well as acoustic.  It makes it so much easier.  this is my first tuner in a long time and I'm please with it."
B000BKY8CU Excellent Product, it is well cushioned. I'm a typical overweight American. Great Sale Price!(Lucky Timing) All Black and fully Assembled! Doesn't get any easier than that... (Batman)"
B000BKY8CU I bought this bench on an Amazon Warehouse Deal so that I could get it on Prime delivery and was not disappointed at all. The bench is very sturdy and comfortable - the cushioning is thick and soft. The item arrives flat packed and can be adjusted to the correct seating height in seconds. This bench is just what I was looking for and I'm sure it will serve its purpose for many years."
B000BKY8CU I actually like this bench a lot. It fits into my gear back (rolling duffle style) that contains my cables / power strips etc., with only the folded legs sticking out of the bag. I have the KT7800, which is much larger seat area, and easier to adjust. Depends on your preference I suppose, this one is smaller / lighter, the other is larger / easier to adjust."
B000BKY8CU The Keyboard Bench is lower than I anticipated.  The seat is very soft and comfortable.  However, it doesn't appear to hold anyone with excess weight."
B000BKY8CU It has a comfortable seat and seems stable and well-made.  However, if you need to haul it around frequently, it takes a bit of time to set up and screw down or open up the screws that hold the moving stability bar on the bottom of the seat. Also, if you need to adjust the height, you have to remove the entire bolt assembly seen at the crossing point of the bars, and then select one of three holes that are only an inch or some apart from each other.  So, not much selection there."
B000BKY8CU For me, I can click this in so it is a nearly perfect height. The padding is great, it is lightweight without feeling cheep."
B000BKY8CU I bought this for my daughter who plays the keyboard. It was already assembled right out of the box, and seems well padded and sturdy. My daughter likes it. I like the price because of the special deal from Amazon."
B000BKY8CU This assembled in just a couple of minutes without the need to refer to the instructions. The bench is comfortably padded and very affordable."
B000BKY8CU It isn't top of the line but it gets the job done. I wouldn't abuse of the chair too much though, the material looks a little floosy."
B000BKY8CU I'm a heavier fellow (5'11, 220) and some of the harder benches I've tried were a tad uncomfortable for long sessions. This one, on the other hand, is very comfortable and has plenty of padding and support. It folds up easily and looks to be very well made. 5 stars, no complaints, and much nicer than a lot of the more expensive options."
B000BKY8CU The price is a great selling point, just by itself.  I use it with my acoustic guitar and the On Stage FS7850B Guitar Foot Rest that I bought off Amazon as well.  It's a good combo.  It leads me to playing for longer periods.  It's solidly constructed.  It folds and is definitely portable.  Great buy."
B000BNSYHW I bought this to restore the neck of an Ibanez that I had ordered used and knew needed TLC.After a few coats of this stuff the neck looked/played/felt like it was just out of the factory! It restored years of neglect in just a few minutes.When I bought this I though it wouldn't be enough. BOY WAS I WRONG. I'll have enough of this oil to last me awhile which makes me happy because I can get that new guitar feel out of my neck for months if not years to come."
B000BNSYHW got this to treat my fretboard on my guitar. Nice airline-sized bottle w/ safety cap to prevent from unintentional opening. Replenished my dried out fretboard to like-new condition."
B000BNSYHW I needed some fretboard cleaner. This is something I had not tried before. I used it and I like it."
B000BNSYHW Has a nice smell, works like a charm. This bottle will probably last me 10 years. Good cheap price...a recommended purchase."
B000BNSYHW This has a nice smell, and is good for maintaining the wood on the neck of your guitar. Best used when replacing strings, so you can apply while the strings are off."
B000BNSYHW Clean really good of prints and smell very nice. My first time using it but like it alot since it works good."
B000BNSYHW Nice quality fretboard oil. Has a nice scent to it, and remember a little goes a long way. I would definitely recommend this. Worked nice on my maple unfinished fretboard."
B000BNSYHW I maintain all of my guitars on a regular basis since I no longer have my own guitar tech to do everything for me! Take care of your fretboards any your fingers and fretboards will be very happy!"
B000BQTCDO This is an iconic fuzz pedal.  Yes, Smashing Pumpkins used this pedal but Corgan also used a Fender Blender (which is similar to the Big Muff but has an octive thing going on too).  This is not a subtle pedal.  It's cuts through the mix well if you are running into a cleanish amp.  I find that it gets a little muddy if I run it into an amp that's already breaking up.  I can say the same thing about most fuzz pedals though.  This is not a wooly, splattery vintage tone like the Dunlop Fuzz Face.  It really has it's own thing going on.  It's not the kind of pedal that I keep on all the time, but it's a cool tool for the sonic toolbox.  If I had it to do all over again I would likely buy the Big Muff with the tone wicker switch.  It's about ten bucks more and has a little more tweekability."
B000BQTCDO i feel strange giving this classic only 3 stars.  but it's just not for me.  it's large and takes up space on my pedal board.  i prefer the little big muff"
B000BQTCDO I have played through this for over 15 years and I will tell you right now, get a big amp. Get 2 amps and split the signal, even. You want to have the biggest amp you can when using this pedal. Otherwise it will come off sounding frail instead of \"Frail and Bedazzled\".Otherwise this pedal conjures up a beastly reference, and it should. I have been in a couple bands where I just plugged this into the amp and played my riffs. The free drinks and loose women followed shortly thereafter.If you're looking for stinging yet rumbly fuzz, this is the pedal you need. I only wish it went up to \"11\"."
B000BQTCDO I owned this pedal for many years, before finally trading it in on some other equipment.  It produces one sound extremely well, but it only does that one thing.  The sound it does very well is the late 60's/early 70's fuzz sound: \"White Room, Black Curtains\"; \"Satisfaction\"; \"Ina Gadda da Vida\".  Note:  this pedal produces very good sustain, but has really bad attack.  As such, it will not really do the \"Whole Lotta Love\" sound.  As I said, it does one thing very well, but its range even with classic rock is quite limited.  If you plan to cover songs with that classic fuzz sound, this pedal gets you 100% of that sound.  If you want to also cover other classic rock, you're gonna need at least one more overdrive/distortion effect."
B000BQTCDO I cannot express how over sized this pedal is - it's ridiculously big and it's unnecessary.if you are lacking space on your pedal board u may want to look elsewhere or retrofit the insides into a smaller housing as i will do.Again - please be aware of the dimensions - this thing is soooooooooooooo hugeit sounds good though - though it does rob tone"
B000BQTCDO It's noisy, but if you find out how to equalize the tone and volume, it works fine. I bought it cause Gilmour uses this effect but certainly the one he uses must be of a much more better quality product."
B000BQTCDO This pedal does exactly what my title suggests... it creates a huge walk of smooth rich fuzz... very smashing pumpkins feel to this. It doesn't do many different tones, but what it does it does very well! And frankly, once I find a good tone out of a pedal, I don't change it often anyhow! This is an amazing value, and a welcome party of my pedal boards. (P.S.: I have the Russian variant...)"
B000BU5V58 We opted for the World Tour \"Guitar Gig Bag\" over a hard case because most of the time my son's guitar is hanging on the wall usingString Swing Hardwood Home & Studio Guitar Hanger (Shades May Vary). This case is generally good quality and meets our needs, with the following observations:Pros -+ Lightweight; doesn't add a lot of pounds but still protects the guitar+ Good Quality; strong material, stitching, and zippers+ Storage Pockets; big enough for music pages, picks, and a small electronic tuner+ Handles; good hand grip handle on the side and has well padded adjustable packpack strapsCons -- Limited Protection; this is not a hard case and it will not provide much protection from a serious impact- Appearance; this is not awe-inspiring to look at, being very basic and the \"World Tour\" logo looks a little \"cheesy\"This was a good choice for the limited, light use it gets from us.Recommended!CFH"
B000BU5V58 This is a fine bag for a guitar, I got it for my brother...I'm not a music person but its good"
B000BU5V58 I don't know who would need better unless you traveled a lot where you might need the hard case.  This one surpassed my expectations.Months into using the Gig Bag and not a single problem.  The pockets are packed with books, tools, and strings.The shoulder straps make carrying the bag across town a breeze."
B000BU5V58 A great universal bag. I can put everything in this bag from my 12 string to my hollow body. Has great pockets to carry your picks, strings, and tuners. The padding is better that I expected. It does have a red strip on this if your concerned about color."
B000BU5V58 Arrived on schedule.  Sturdy, with adequate padding to protect my &#34;babies&#34;.  Three zipper pockets to hold cords, mics, capos and tuners as still have room for keys and combs.  I own several gig bags, and this is my favorite."
B000BU5V58 Received item when promised, fits great for my Yamaha Acoustic Electric, but carry with care, remember Acoustics are hollow body and can bust if dropped, great zipped pockets."
B000BU5V58 This case is very durable, nice heavy duty zippers and pockets for storage. The 20mm is perfect to protect instrument during travel. The red piping in the picture is more maroon in real life."
B000BU5V58 I bought a Hollowbody without a case and wanted a gig bag in case I decided to take it anywhere. The prices of the other bags ranged from more than double this one to almost four times. I have other guitars and they all have cases and I might never actually take this guitar anywhere so I didn' twant to spend a lot. Price was a big issue. The guitar fits great. The bag is well padded and I can't believe the price."
B000BU5V58 I purchased this for my daughter who is 10.  She is learning to play guitar and needed a bag to protect the new guitar I bought her.  This bag has plenty of storage, offers good protection and the guitar fit perfectly.  I am going to purchase another one for my guitar."
B000BUDO48 Decent quality.  Cheap price.  We'll see how long it lasts.  But, for now, does the trick.  I think the odds of be becoming rich and famous have increased because of this stand."
B000BUDO48 This is a very good and stable stand. Light, strong, and very balanced. It makes my guitar feel secure. It is also ideal for travel since when folded can just be slipped into a small bag."
B000BUDO48 This is my favorite light weight guitar stand, simple and does the job.  I try to avoid the stands with lever locking mechanisms at the neck rest which are a pain in the arse when you are trying to switch guitars on the fly.  These are lightweight and collapsible so you can take them anywhere, and are sturdy enough for 'normal' use.  If you're a klutz no guitar stand will be sufficient unless it is encased in carbonite."
B000BUDO48 I have my 12 string on this stand when I'm taking a break from practicing (as you know, a case is where you should store your guitars, not on a stand). It is easy to assemble. You'll pay a lot more money for stands that do the job just as well as this one. if you're gigging, I might suggest a higher priced stand, but for occasional travel and home use, this will do the trick."
B000BUDO48 This guitar stand does NOT find hidden treasure. It does NOT hypnotize beautiful women. It does NOT fix your transmission. It does NOT tell your boss to give you a raise.It just holds onto your guitar when you don't see any reason to put into a case. It's sturdy, reliable and to the point. No gimmicks, nothing flashy. Just a guitar stand that is reasonably priced. If you need one, might as well be this one."
B000BUDO48 I bought 3 of these because of the ridiculously low price...I figured I'd get my money's worth from them regardless.  They work fine.  So well, that I thought I would buy a few more for the studio.  The price went up nearly 50% on them though.  BAH."
B000BUDO48 There are a fair number of similar tripod guitar stands out there for about the same cost.  If one of your pet peeves with some of these is that the U-shaped support falls out when you carry the assembled stand around, then you'll especially like the World Tour stand.  The way that the U-shaped piece inserts makes it far less susceptible to falling out. And, although it is, as one other reviewer put it, \"minimalistic,\" this stand has a substantial feel to it.  I'm quite happy with this purchase, and would buy another World Tour again, rather than one of the other brands that I own.  Amazon.com did a great job, too, getting this out to me."
B000BUDO48 This stand is very nice, it is black and it does its job very well. It also has a strap on the top holder to secure the guitar when it is on the stand. It is like an added bonus."
B000BUDO48 I've bought quite a few guitar stands off of Amazon in the past few years, and I've paid for the most expensive ones and the cheapest ones, and this is the best one I've found yet. Very sturdy, well made, and fully height adjustable, with strong soft foam to protect your precious guitars from getting all scratched up. It states that cellulose finishes can be damaged, so at least it lets you know that ahead of time(most cheap stands don't), so that's a good thing as well. Don't waste more money than you have to for a good quality stand, grab this one!"
B000BUDO48 This seems like a nice product, but maybe I'm doing something wrong.  I can't get the bottom guitar support to lock in place.  It twists around and that makes it a little hard to put the guitar in place.  Maybe there is something I need to do differently?"
B000BUDO48 I got two of these for my electric bass and rhythm guitars.  Great little stands at a great price.  They are sturdy, easy to assemble and adjustable.  I'd suggest this to anyone needing a guitar stand."
B000BUDO48 I ordered two of these stands and they work very well! Definitely keeps my guitars a lot safer than having them leaning against things."
B000BUGNNM Case  arrived in great condition.Quite Roomy, fits my Vendetta AND/Or my Les Paul - Two exterior pockets for tools, extras, etc.2x Thicker padding than the Epiphone gig bag I got for the LP, but all these have to do is protect and keep dust away - I'm not hauling them to shows...Get One."
B000BUGNNM Nice bag with great features. It is slightly large for a Telecaster or Stratocaster but works fine for either.I actually swapped another bag, putting a Les Paul Jr in this one and a Tele in the Gibson bag as theGibson bag was a really tight fit for the LP JR. headstock."
B000BUGNNM I am deployed to middle east and beat my guitars up pretty good.  I have 3 World Tour bags to keep my axes safe!  Nice padding, nice features."
B000BUGNNM This is a great gig bag for the money. It has more padding than I thought it would have, has very strong construction, and plenty of places to store stuff like sheet music and cables. The carry handle and shoulder straps are well padded and comfortable to use as well. It's even reasonably water proof, handling the light rain shower well with zero leaks. For the money, this is the best one I've bought on Amazon, and will certainly buy it again in the future. Highly recommended!"
B000BUGNNM I have an ESP guitar with a slanted headstock that had a hard time fitting into the gig bag that the music store threw in when I got the guitar. After buying a line-6 pocket pod and some good studio headphones there was simply no room left in that old bag.Found this bag and liked the fact that it has so many front pockets and it really looked like it would fit all of my gear, cables, etc. I originally put it on my wish list because I will admit, you don't always want to spend your own money on stuff like this but my wife ended up surprising me with this and it was a great surprise.My guitar fits perfectly. It used to be a struggle getting my guitar in the old gig bag and zipping it shut. As mentioned, the curved headstock makes the guitar taller and the old gig bag always had the pointed tip of the headstock poking out of it because it just would not close.But this big closes all the way and it does have so much more padding than my previous bag. And the pockets - OH THE POCKETS! They fit ALL of my gear. I have my guitar cable, a set of full size sennheiser headphones, a line 6 pocket pod, all the allen wrenches, a tuner, and my tremelo neatly organized in all the separate pockets. And there is room for more if I need it!The bag does smell a little funky the first few days but it didn't stink up the house like some reviewers mentioned. Just open it up and let it air out in a part of the house where it won't bother anyone and it's fine after a day or two.One last thing about this bag is that it has a handle right up near the headstock. I did not know this but wow I had no idea how useful that could be. I tend to carry my guitar, in bag, up and down stairs a lot and being able to hold it in two places is extremely useful. Then you have the backpack handles as an option as well. I really cannot recommend this bag enough. I do agree with the other user who said the log on it is a little kiddie like, but I don't really care, the bag is too perfect for me to be bothered by that, and while the padding is great, I would not recommend this bag for checking your bag for air travel. It would be fine if you use it as a carry on but would not protect much in checked baggage, in case you want it for that kind of thing. I don't travel long distances with my guitar but if I did, I would use a hard case only for that as I have seen too many horror stories of smashed guitars on airlines lately.Hope that helps anyone out there looking for a gig bag with tons of room for your gear!"
B000BUGNNM This bag is well padded, has backpack straps to carry comfortable, and several pockets to hold cable, extra strings, picks, and much, much more. For the price, I feel like it is a steal. Some people complain about the smell. It kind of smells like motor oil. It is strange, but being I have been around that smell so much, it doesn't bother me. Be warned about it though."
B000BUGNNM Got this for an SG-style guitar, and it fits with plenty of room.  This is a better quality bag than an &#34;average&#34; bag, but with a couple of comments:1.  It smells like an industrial rubber factory upon opening.2.  The large, main zipper is easy to close but somewhat difficult to unzip.  Surprised me because it's a large-toothed zipper.3.  Construction seems to be pretty good.  This is not a hard case, but to get a guitar from point A to B, it works just fine.4.  Padding is sufficiently thick.  It's not a paper thin bag, but it's not thick enough that the guitar would survive a drop.Would I get another one?  Probably, as long as the use was long term storage or to travel small distances.  Otherwise, I'd get a soft sided hard case (the new wave of Styrofoam cases) or a regular old hard sided case."
B000BUGNNM I have seven of these that I use on my Ibanez AM73's, but they are perfect for anyAM series guitars (like the 93).The bag is well padded, and not to expensive.It seems it is always on back order which tells me they are very popular.The dimensions are: 41\"L, 14\"W at Bout, and 3\" Deep. It has two large zippers; the head zipper goes all the wayaround, and the bout zipper stops before entering the bottom area which is the ONLY draw back to thisgig bag, as with ALL deeper guitars, you want the bottom (bout) zipper to at least complete the bottom areato make placing and removing easier.This is the best gig bag I have found in the last few years for the smaller bout guitars that does not cost too much."
B000BUGNNM This is a great bag, regardless of cost. The fact that it sells for less than $20 makes it an absolutely fantastic deal. (Free shipping only makes it that much better.) Unlike some other reviewers, I have not noticed any objectionable smell. I will attest to the fact that it is very well constructed. The fabric itself is a heavy cordura material, the zippers and pulls are heavy duty too, and the padding is stiff and thick enough to afford your (solid body) guitar some very substantial protection. (I would estimate the padding, which is entirely concealed within the cordura, to be approximately three-quarters of an inch thick.) In addition to the main carry handle at the side, there is another in back, at the top, as well a pair of backpack-style straps, so finding a convenient means of carrying your guitar shouldn't be any kind of an issue. The two zippered accessory pouches (for picks, a spare set of strings, and perhaps some music) are also a nice touch. In my opinion, this bag could easily sell for twice the price and still be considered a bargain. As it is, it's very cheap insurance for my Epi Les Paul II."
B000BUGNNM This quality bag would probably cost more like $35+ at your local music store. Appears well made, has good padding and several pockets for strings, picks, cable, whatever. Taking one star off for the slightly bothersome smell (also mentioned by other reviewers). Not terrible, but somehow chemical. Hope it goes away soon."
B000BW2D84 I bought a Pedaltrain pedal board and I have 6 individual stomp boxes that are crammed onto it. I originally bought Hosa connectors and they are high quality and have a low profile, but the selection of lengths is limited. I bought this kit with a little trepidation and proceeded to re-do the board. I swear I was done in 20 minutes!! The board looks awesome with all the cables cut to perfect length. These cables are dead silent and the connectors are high quality. The supplied cutting tool works as described and the only thing you need is a small-tip, flathead screwdriver with a medium size handle so you can firmly drive the locking screw into the cable for the final step. I could have saved some money if I had just bought these first instead of a bunch of random length patch cables."
B000BW2D84 The good thing about the Cable Station is you can make your own cables at custom lengths so you can have a neater pedal board without the need to solder the connections in place. All you have to do is cut the cable flush, insert it into the \" plug with a twisting motion, and then turn the setscrew on the side of the plug until it is tight.As a benefit, if there is a shorting of the signal all you need to do is find the offending cable, remove the plug, cut the cable, and insert the end back into the plug.Great right?Well, not really.As far as reliability goes, nothing can really replace the connection that is properly soldered. With the money you spend, you could easily get a decent soldering iron, some old cable, and some cheap plugs from Radio Shack and practice. In the end, you can by bulk cable and connectors and make them as needed.I have used this product and had to re-cut several cables at different times but only to cables that have been constantly moved around. The other ones that are more permanent haves not given me trouble, but I have experienced problems in the past. Always have a few spares that have been tested.Another annoying thing is that they give you more cable than connectors, I would think 15 connectors would be more sufficient.Is it easier than soldering? Yes.Are they reliable? For the most part, yes.Will I continue using the product? Yes, because I usually have spares.Why do I use them then? I'm lazy.This is from the Cleartone cables website about gold connectors:Don.t waste your money if you are being asked to pay extra for gold plated connectors. The thin soft gold (5-10 microns) .flash. plating looks cool, but scrapes off easily and the brass aterial underneath stops you from seeing that the gold has worn off! The brass eventually  tarnishes and causes crackling when the plug moves or twists in the socket contacts.It is true that gold is a very good conductor of electricity when mated with a gold plated socket. But the sockets inside your guitar amplifier and guitar are not usually gold, so there can be virtually no benefit to gold plated plugs."
B000BW2D84 I am a tech as well as a guitar player. I also have spent time in the past Teaching soldering. But these cables seem to be well made with good solderless connections. Most of us know by now that there's a lot of hype but it really comes down to Good Quality Cable (This Seems to be) Good Stable Connectors (These seem to be) & the connections between the two that last (Time will tell). All I know is I have Hand Soldered Special plugs with Good Cable to only have them break with use and I expect the same with these especially in a high use situation where they are plugged & unplugged often.- I do know these are signal clean & do Not bleed f highs & that is critical in my book.- They are Very Easy to use & can be done on Stage between or before sets very quickly and with NO Soldering & I Love that!I will definitely use these again unless I find a longevity problem.LM"
B000BW2D84 Very good quality cable and plugs. Easy to make custom length cables from 3 inches to 30 ft. My pedal board looks so professional and uncluttered that I actually made room for 1 more because there was no extra wire to get in the way."
B000BW2D84 This is one of my favorite music purchases in a while. Cleans up your gear's appearance tremendously. Very easy to use and lots of extra cable length."
B000BW2D84 What can I say? I started out with a couple of pedals, then a wah, then more, then a board for them, and sooner or later all those 6&#34; cords are either in the way, too short or whatever. I do like the male-male offset connectors to bring pedals together but sometimes on a board you've got odd distances. This kit does the trick, and truly was easy to use. Only once did I create a plug with a bad connection and had to redo it."
B000BWEM42 Some of the complaints are well warranted about this cheap unit.  First of all I had to fumble around with it for almost 15 minutes to get it to open straight because it seems like I got a previously-returned unit that some other customer must have bent the arms the wrong way along the joints and I was careful not to manhandle it because I could tell it would break if bent it the wrong way with too much force.  I was about to give up but I felt bad to do the return because I didnt want to make Amazon lose money and this is a weird shaped box and probably costs over $8 in postage to send back to them.But eventually I figured it out.  I am a 5 ft 10 inches tall man and this stand is tall enough because I opened it all the way and there was still an inch or 2 to spare if I wanted to raise it to the maximum.  Looks like those complaining about the height did not realize that all 3 segments can be stretched out to reveal the full height (They probably only raised 2 out of the 3 segments).So for the price I think you get what you pay for and since I just want a stand that will stay in my bedroom at home I think this unit will suffice but if you plan to travel around with it or if you are getting it for a kid under 18 years old I recommend you buy a sturdier unit than this because they will probably break it in short order.  And then you will be out the fifteen bucks plus have to buy a new one.The truth is that its a flimsy piece of junk, okay for a responsible adult that will treat it with great care (such as myself) but not for children or drunks, it is very fragile and easy to break.  I took the advice and tightened the adjustment knobs for height only finger tight without great force as previous reviewers attest that it is easy to strip out the bolt if you over-tighten so be very, very careful.I will keep mine but if I had to purchase a second unit I would not buy this one because I dont like flimsy junk and I feel even my large dog could knock this down and break the dang thing."
B000BWEM42 I bought this to replace a folding stand that was just not strong enough to hold up under the weight of some of my guitar books. This stand works great for me, and hold even the largest of my music and tab books.The construction is much better than other portable stands I've used in the past, and has two great features that I really appreciate. One is it's height adjustable, and two is the tilting head. The tilting head is a real bonous on a portable stnad, and this one works great.For the price this stand is a great buy that I would recommend to anyone, but being primarily a guitarist this stand is execptional. With the page holders tilting head and height adjustability this is one of the best stand purchases a guitarist can make."
B000BWEM42 Of course, this stand is not nearly as solid feeling as my much-heavier, solid-metal music stand I use at home. It does twist around a bit when you handle it. On the other hand, it's much lighter, collapsible, and it goes inside my practice bag instead of being a piece of furniture that takes another hand to lug. For my practices and rehearsals I want to travel light. This stand fits that bill, and its desk angle is adjustable so it works well for large fake books and for a single lead sheet. I had two pieces of thin plexiglass cut at my local hardware store to sandwich separate sheets of music so I have no problems with wind or with three-sheet-wide scores. I've never had a sturdiness problem with this stand, and I've never had it tip over, but I am careful not to tighten the knobs more than necessary, and I set the legs to their sturdiest position. I always play sitting, so height is not a consideration for me. But I have measured it and found that at its highest elevation the bottom of the sheet music is 50\" off the floor. That's plenty high for me even if I were a vocalist, and I'm 6'1\". Sure, it does not impress as would an $80-$100, stand but the quality is almost unbelievable for $13. I notice that some of the negative reviews are two or three years old, and I wonder if this stand was the same design then that it is now. It IS a lightweight stand and I take care with the knobs, but I certainly would not call it flimsy.One discrepancy that might be important to you: The stand they delivered to me this month (October 2011) was NOT a \"two section\" stand, as advertised. It's all in one section and it collapses down to a 20\" length that fits in my practice bag. I actually consider this a plus since it makes it quicker and easier to erect at rehearsals. I bought one of these Hisonic Signature stands a few years back, but they've changed it a bit. That one definitely was in two sections, and I made the top section into an excellent table-top book stand. That older one also had folding-clip-type clamps for each section instead of the turn-knob-screw-in type of clamps."
B000BWEM42 It may be a challenge to assemble it.I personally found it a challenge to assemble it but that is just how I am wired.I am not 'good' at putting things together without help.Good product after you get it assembled.James :)"
B000BWEM42 As a newbie violin student I needed a music stand.  Having purchased many things before through Amazon.com, I have learned to trust the customer reviews which get posted (remembering that there will always be a few cranks).  This music stand got good reviews and I can say that I too am very happy with it.  I would recommend this purchase to any one."
B000BWEM42 This stand is a little difficult to open.  The top the gets very stuck and turned the wrong way.  Other than that the stand collapses very small into the black bag that came with it."
B000BYPJ1U Its easy to set up and use. Simple instructions are on a sticker on the bottom of it. I re soak it easy 2-3 weeks or so. Can't tell if it's truly working on my maple wood ukulele."
B000BYPJ1U I have been using Hercos for for many years. They are simple to use and offer my banjos good humidification.  I place a Herco in the neck section of the case and another in the section where the head sits.For guitars I place a Herco near the peg head and a stringed instrument humidifier that slips between the strings in the other. Great insurance against damage to instruments owing to dryness."
B000BYPJ1U I like these humidifiers.  Works if you keep it with instrument in your case, and upkeep is minimal.  Work on all strings very well, but be careful, easy to fall out of case, so just be careful!"
B000BYPJ1U Stuck one in my guitar case to keep it just the right humidity. A must have for us dry Californians."
B000BYPJ1U It doesn't seem to work. I think maybe mine was damaged or something because it doesn't seem to absorb any water."
B000BYPJ1U I was taking lessons from a very qualified instructor and he mentioned that I need a humidifier for my guitar. At first I was not sure what I was looking for. I found the product without too much difficulty. I had learned from my instructor that these are small, placed on the hole of the guitar, and was definitely needed to keep the guitar in good playing condition. I started looking through the computer pages and settled on the Herco Guitar Humidifier because of the recommendations of thew product. Now I feel I made a wise choice and will be able to keep my quitar playing good vibrations, and good music!"
B000BYPJ1U Herco is a Jim Dunlop company and this little humidifier was suggested to me through someone who has used them for awhile. Dunlop is a trusted brand in guitar maintenance for the most part. I wanted to stay away from the typical humidifiers due to their tendencies to leak and stain the guitar wood. I have used this for a few weeks now and it still remians moist. The product came fast and the instructions are straight forward. I may order another if this one performs well."
B000BYPJ1U I used to use the Martin tube thing that you stick between the strings.  But it was a bit of a pain.  You had to soak it, then drain it, then wipe it.  Even then, I worried about it dripping on the inside of the guitar.  This is much easier and the guitar sounds great.  Highly recommended."
B000CBE3G4 Great slap echo sound.  Do not buy this with the expectation that it will act like a digital delay- it's closer to a reverb.  It provides an echo sound similar to if you were playing in a room covered in tile (an old engineering trick!).  Great for old school rock and roll, rockabilly, chicken pickin etc.  This will fatten up the sound of a dry amp.  As with all FAB pedals, I find the knob placement slightly annoying, but at this price point you can't really make a justifiable complaint.  Construction quality is somewhat cheap but the knobs feel solid and it has not failed me in more than a year."
B000CBE3G4 This pedal works but doesn't have the depth of echo I expected. I doesn't even come close to the same sound quality of my old Dan Echo DE-1 pedal.  That certainly explains the difference in price. You get what you pay for. I'm using it with a Fender Eighty-Five solid state amp. I tried it with other amps and it sounds the same. If you're looking for a good slap echo effect, I would recommend spending more money and buy the Dan Echo DE-1 pedal or even the Danelectro BLT slap echo pedal is less expensive than the Dan Echo, but still sounds better than the FAB echo pedal. The FAB echo pedal works and you can hear a definite difference with and without it. It's just not as good as I expected. I'm sorry I bought it and I don't recommend this pedal. There are much better ones on the market. Shop around."
B000CBE3G4 These FAB pedals are cheap and mostly mediocre, but I bought this on a whim to use with a Fender tube amp and it works well. As other reviewers have stated, the pedal does not have very good build quality but it seems to hold up okay as long as it's not abused. I use the echo with both a telecaster and a cigar box guitar for vintage effects.I have found that the delay works well around 50 percent and the mix can be modulated to make a good mix of reverb and delay. I don't know if I would gig with this pedal or any othe FAB pedal because of my tendency to step hard on a pedal in live environments, but it serves it's purpose well and is cheaper than alot of other delay and echo pedals if you just need a basic effect. I have seen info about modding the pedal to control the delay and may do this in the future.I have alot of other pedals and I tried this pedal with a jazz bass, with some EQ tinkering, I found a good mix of echo. I originally saw a youtube video of a bass player using a D-4 and thought it would be a good idea. Again, Danelectro makes a higher end echo pedal which probably does a better job with delay, but this is a good deal and was $100 dollars cheaper than my Electro Harmonix Memory Boy pedal and sounds cool as a vintage vibe with an old amp."
B000CBE3G4 I've needed one of these for my fender amp, yes I used to spend time dialing in the delay pedal for the rockabilly/blues numbers and if my settings got messed up, well, that would slow the show down. I wish my fender amp had this built into the amp but it didn't. This pedal makes playing rockabilly on my fender simple fast and easy. Really quick to setup and use. It's not a delay unit, it's not versatile either, but what it does, it does perfect!"
B000CBE3G4 The Danelectro FAB  series of pedals offer a great sound without digging into your budget.  The D-4 Slap Echo effects pedal works great and gives me that Old Tube Amp Reverb sound that you would only expect from a more expensive unit.  There's no fancy bells and whistles but just good old manual adjustments that lets you dial in the sound you want with no effort at all..  This series of pedals ( FAB ) have hard plastic cases and less expensive hardware than the more costly units but works quit well.  Danelectro offers more expensive units but I don't think the sound is much better, just the hardware is better, but that's my view!!!.  You can't go wrong with this product, Danelectro has been around for years and makes a great product...I have six Danelectro effects pedals and they all work great..."
B000CBE3G4 this is perfect for playing rockabilly or country music.the case is made of plastic but seems sturdy as long as you dont stomp on it too hard. but for 20 dollars its well worth the price.  this is a great product and i highly recomend it."
B000CBE3G4 I'm sure this isn't the best echo pedal (or even in the top 100), but it serves it's purpose fairly well. Stacking with other cheap danelectro pedals will degrade your tone but it isn't something that most of us can't live with. for 14.99 us it's worth taking the risk IMHOUpdate: The pedal gave up the ghost (died) In a relatively short amount of time. I replaced it with  mini modtone type delay.... I actually like the dano sound better, but the modtone will do for a slapback and it is built way better."
B000CBE3G4 I admit, i was really just curious how good a $15 pedal could possibly be, so i figured i would try one out. I had played some Danelectro stuff in the past (a baritone guitar and an amp many years ago) and remembered being satisfied with their stuff. Anyway, i figured since the pedal was so cheap, why not try it out.You know, it is a pretty decent stompbox. The slap echo is a good enhancement effect, meaning, it isnt really over the top....just gives you a mellow, reverb-ish echo...not quite delay, not quite reverb...kind of somewhere in between. I have since added it to my stompbox set up for that little something different. Not bad at all. I cant speak to battery life though, since i use an adapter combo to power all my effects. For kicks, try it out with some distortion and/or overdrive, and a wah....Anyway....Enjoy!"
B000CBE3G4 Is the the best pedal ever? Not even close. Does it do EXACTLY what you want a simple slap-back echo/reverb to do? Absolutely! I almost always have it on just to add a little depth to my synth or guitar sound. It can give you a decently wet surf-ish sound or a fast delay, rockabilly sound. It's not super versatile but if you're looking for a little depth and color for under $20 then this is what you need.I mean, COME ON! It works, it's cheap, and it doesn't take up much room on your pedal board!"
B000CBE3G4 It has a 1950's slap back echo Its good for the price No putting It down for Sounding bad as with most Danelecto products and probably higher price and lower price products used the same circuits. If You want something that Is just reverb without all the slap back then Behringer DR600 which I use for Vocal for Guitar I use RV600 which has space verb and ducking also called shimmer."
B000CBE3G4 I bought one of these pedals 3 years ago, along with some of the other Danelectro pedals in this line, and was happy with it. The sound I get with it is very, very cool. After a while it just stopped working. While I was disappointed at that moment I just ordered another one the next time I was online. You can't beat the price. If it does stop working after after a few years of use, you aren't looking at paying $90 or more for a new pedal. All of my other Danelectro pedals are still working just fine so it may have been a fluke in the electronics or I just used it to death. An electrical engineer friend and I took the pedal apart to try and fix it but decided it wasn't worth taking up our time since I could replace for $15. So I ordered another one. Definately get an adapter for this. Yes, it's casing is plastic but quite sturdy. Just don't jump on it like you're trying to put out a fire when turning it on and off. Guitars and effects are the tools of a musican's trade not the hammer and nails of a builder's. Think about getting a 1 Spot adapter so you can chain several pedals to one outlet. If you would rather use batteries for each of your pedals...well...I'd suggest buying them by the gross. Any effects pedal made by any company is going to eat batteries like a stoner eats potato chips. Used alone or with other effects, the Danelectro Fab Slap Echo Effects Pedal will be sure to delight your auditory kinesthesis."
B000CBE3G4 good price for effect  if your looking for a bit of echo then this is for you.  I have amps that have this feature that due a better job."
B000CBE3GE It's a flange pedal, what else? For the price I was really happy with it. If I knew someone who was more skilled than me I'd get the workings inside a different case. The shape is cool, but I'd feel safer with it in a metal casing. The button is smaller than I thought, but it's not an issue at all; it's kinda easier to press!As for someone like me who is starting to get into pedals, for the price just to see how they work and if you want to invest in this realm, I would recommend this!"
B000CBE3GE The regen control goes to very strong deep levels that will rumble the floor at the lower end (My fender excelsior with it's 15 inch speaker rattled the walls) of its sweep and can give a very cool effect. I notice very little tone suck with the pedal bypassed. Also, the speed know has a great range with 5+ second sweeps to super fast leslie and univibe like tones. The depth knob does it's job. It doesn't have a manual knob to move the sweep, but I leave the depth all the way up most of the time so it's no big deal. For the price, this was perfect for trying out a discreet flanger pedal instead of the one built into my Vox modeling amp."
B000CBE3GE -1 star for plastic...otherwise excellent , YouTube has many reviews on these,The FAB pedals are great values,For what a flanger is for me, this is perfect, great sounds great price."
B000CBE3GE The Danelectro FAB  series of pedals offer a great sound without digging into your budget.  The D-6 Fab Flange effects pedal works great and gives me that wobble phase shift you would only expect from a more expensive unit...  This series of pedals ( FAB ) have hard plastic cases and less expensive hardware than the more costly units but works quit well.  Danelectro offers more expensive units but I don't think the sound is much better, just the hardware is better, but that's my view!!!.  You can't go wrong with this product, Danelectro has been around for years and makes a great product...I have six Danelectro effects pedals and they all work great..."
B000CBE3GE the case is made of plastic so care should be taken in stomping on it but the product is so much fun!!! this thing is so worth the 20 dollars that i paid for it and more! wide sweeping flange effect, great harmonics and little power useage.  well worth the investment!!!!"
B000CBXZXG I'm a fanatic about my frets looking shiny and polished.  I want them to be slick when I bend notes.  If you polish too hard or too often with steel wool, it can wear down your frets.  These micro abrasive sheets do a great job without harming your frets.  I watched a Youtube demo and that sold me on ordering them.  I think Amazon had the best price."
B000CBXZXG My frets were completely whited after using one of these sheets. I recommend using it togheter with a metal cleaner and you will return your frets to original factory bright. Incredible!"
B000CBXZXG I opened the package for the first time and didn't think much of it, but the cloth works great on cleaning frets and even the cardboard template does its job.  Obviously, cardboard isn't going to last so purchase metal templates and use the cloths."
B000CBXZXG The sheets seem to work fine to polish the frets but the template is cut from the cardboard box which obviously isn't going to last long.  Also, trying to hold the cardboard on the neck is a pain and my finger is killing.I'm going to go buy a fret eraser and be done with it."
B000CBXZXG Will this replace a pro fret job? Nah...That said this works great for use a few times a year to clean the frets an make them shiny and smooth.End results[...]"
B000CCIVCA I use this all the time for testing audio cables and it works great! It's got an all metal housing and seems sturdy too. Battery lasts for months. Well done Behringer!"
B000CCIVCA Solidly built, small tester that can easily be carried around in a gig bag.  There isn't really much in the way of instructions, but the LEDs are fairly well labeled and straight forward enough to figure it out."
B000CCIVCA If you are in a band or a sound guy for a band you gotta have one of these. The time and stress saved by not depending on trial and error to eliminate good/bad cable is priceless. Bottom line!!! eliminate a variable and audio problems are faster and easier to solve."
B000CCIVCA A must have in every gig bag for checking all your cables.  I keep this with my battery tester for my active's.  Sure eliminates a lot of guess work at this first hint of audio trouble.  Easy to use and economical product."
B000CCIVCA If you'd ever been setting up on stage and discover hum or hiss this box is for you. It will find a bad or intermittent calbe in a heart beat. It will locate a shorted XLR or an open ground fast. Don't go onto the stage without one on these boxes."
B000CCIVCA We bought this tester for our son to use for his band's equipment set-up. It appears to be well constructed, and should help to diagnose problems with cables as they work through equipment connection issues."
B000CCIVCA I have been using this tester for about a year to test out my XLR cables and those that I come into contact with at work. It works but does not detect all faults (only non intermittent ones), it comes in a durable enough housing and is compact enough to take everywhere."
B000CCIVCA Does a great job of checking cords. Was able to eliminate a lot of bad cords from my stash. Tests multiple types of cords also!"
B000CCIVCA I picked up this Behringer CT100 cable tester because it takes the guesswork out of maintaining a cable collection. The unit does its job very well and it helped me find several bad cables that I previously thought were ok. It is well built and sturdy. The bottom of the tester has sharp metal corners and screws that could damage a wooden table. I suggest you get some adhesive rubber pads to support the underside.Although the machine itself is good, the accompanying documentation is awful. It presupposes a working knowledge with audio equipment that many users may lack. For example, it does not include illustrations of how the LCD readout should look when a cable is good or bad. I had to go to an audio engineering forum to find a diagram. As it turns out, the Behringer CT100 is an inexpensive knockoff of the Morley Swizz Army cable tester. The manual for the Morley unit is available online and it has diagrams that make the testing easier to understand."
B000CCIVCA This thing will test most all the cables a musician will use ... rugged, reliable and simple to understand ... for the price, it is hard to beat ..."
B000CCIVCA Idiot-proof, compact, extremely sturdy. All metal enclosure with good quality jacks, simple to understand LED readouts. Runs on 2 AA batteries.Features that set this apart from the slightly cheaperPyle-Pro PCT10are:-'Test tone' function which sends a known volume signal down the line. Very helpful in level adjustments down long chains of equipment.-'Intermittent' issue indication - This is what made me choose this model. If there's even the shortest dropout, the LEDs indicate it. Intermittent issues are the most annoying and can be difficult to troubleshoot.My only complaints:-The a small screw holding the battery cover on stripped immediately when initially inserting batteries. It was like carving a bar of soap with a knife. Quite frustrating. Used my Dremel to change it from phillips into a slotted screw, and managed to get it out.-There's an included belt clip that attaches with two screws on the back. This clip blocks access to the battery compartment, which is ridiculous. Luckily I have no need for the clip. I used one of the screws intended for the clip as a replacement to the stripped battery cover screw.-No rubber feet on the bottom + metal enclosure + battery cover screw = sliding around and marring whatever it sits on. I stuck some re-purposed rubber feet on the bottom.After the few 'problem solving' situations mentioned above, this thing is a 5 star product. Too bad they couldn't go the extra step to make it 5 star out of the box."
B000CCJP4I For the price, it's worth it I guess. If you just want to try it, go for it, that's what I got it for. It sounds nice and adds a cool tone to my setup, but after playing on a few more expensive chorus pedals I would suggest saving up if you really need a chorus pedal. But for the price it's not too bad.Oh, and the casing isn't like a wimpy plastic knife plastic. it's pretty durable. Albeit don't throw this on concrete and expect great results but it could stand a few stomps."
B000CCJP4I I mean you paid 15$ for a pedal that if you want to buy from the BOSS it's about 6times this price and if you want it behringer it's about twice this price. It does what is supposed to and it doesn't have a cheap look. For home and garage entertainment is good enough. I was trying this pedal before i buy any other pedal from the same brand, but now that i know that i like it i'm going to buy the distortion (red) one. i'm only sad they don't make a noise gate or something similar. That would be the top of the deal."
B000CCJP4I The Chorus is subtle... but it seems lacking to me. It is subtle but really weak compared to the classic rich ibanez chorus i have."
B000CCJP4I the effect it self is fine, but it is too noisy even though u don't dime it, for the price, and for this product, it is u get what u pay for."
B000CCJP4I This puppy sounds fantastic. The controls allow the effect to be adjusted from very faint to over the top Chorus with deep and intense sound. The controls are on the front, as are the in/out plugs, so it is a little tight when adjusting the knobs. Very reasonable pricing. Uses a 9V battery or 9V adaptor. It has a retro look and an old school sound, perfect."
B000CCJP4I fast delivery, works perfectly...I have 3 of the Danelectro effects pedals... hard to say which I prefer most cause they all have an individual and distinct sound...I'm partial to the chorus ...good item"
B000CCJP4I It's plastic that's 1 star deduction, but in this case, very pleas
B000CCJP4I How many times did I tweak a chorus pedal for hours and in the end decided I didn't need chorus at all. This pedal is not like that, not much to tweak but the chorus is great. Sweetens my cleans, makes the blues sound groovy and fattens the power chords. I even like it with the bass. Just a great chorus with not much to tweak."
B000CCJP4I The Danelectro FAB  series of pedals offer a great sound without digging into your budget.  The D-5 Chorus effects pedal works great and gives me that soft phase shift you would only expect from a more expensive unit...  This series of pedals ( FAB ) have hard plastic cases and less expensive hardware than the more costly units but works quit well.  Danelectro offers more expensive units but I don't think the sound is much better, just the hardware is better, but that's my view!!!.  You can't go wrong with this product, Danelectro has been around for years and makes a great product...I have six Danelectro effects pedals and they all work great..."
B000CCJP4I Yes, this pedal is made of plastic. Yes it is inexpensive. But don't be fooled- unless you really mash on the switch button like an idiot, or over torque the battery cover screw too hard with a screw driver and strip out the plastic threads- it is pretty tough and durable. The chorus effect has plenty of adjustment, tone, and depth. It may not be a Boss pedal, but for $15.99 you are getting a tremendous value and it sounds very good. I was so impressed with these inexpensive pedals I now own 4 or 5 of them. As a hobbyist guitar player who does not want to invest hundreds of dollars into multiple effects pedals- I am into 4 or 5 of them PLUS associated cables and a power adapter for about the same amount than I could buy ONE Boss or other high quality pedal for.I would also recommend buying the Danelectrode 9V power adapter if you use multiple pedals. You can also buy a 5 gang power cable and daisy chain up to 4 or 5 pedals from the same power supply to make your own pedal board. If you have multiple Danelectro pedals it is a clean way to tie them together. I also bought some short 6 inch instrument cables and daisy chained the pedal inputs/outputs together so I can have mixed effects, or have each one independently.These pedals have been used almost daily for a couple of months now and I have not had one issue with any to date. A few other guitar player friends that have tried mine out are also very impressed by them. Absolutely a 5 star value!"
B000CCJP4I Got this little guy last night to use with my Squier Tele Custom II, hooked it up and played around with it for a while and it really impressed me for the quality of effect you get for nearly pocket change! I also have a Digitech RP-50 that has multiple effects including different types of chorus and this Fab Chorus sounds better than any of the RP-50's chorus settings.  I am so looking forward to laying down some cool tracks using this with the Tele, my Applause acoustic/electric, and my Squier Vintage Modified 70's bass guitar. And like other folks who've bought this product, I'll most likely be getting some of Danelectro's other Fab boxes and the Dan Electrode power supply."
B000CCJP4I The Danelectro FAB series is supposed to be everything we hate about effects pedals.  Cheap.  Mass-produced.  Housed in a plastic casing.  But the FAB series offers affordable effects ($15 to $20) at surprisingly good quality, and end up sounding as good as some pedals that cost 3 times more.  If this pedal cost $50, I might gripe about how tight together the input/output/9V jacks are.  I might also complain about the weird position of the Mix, Speed, and Depth controls on the top of the unit, or the small footswitch.  But at this price, for it to sound THIS good, I can't complain at all.Don't expect the FAB series to be good at everything.  But if there's and effect out there that you only use once in awhile (especially anything involving modulation or delay), the FAB series is going to do it well, and do it for a fraction of the cost of other pedals.  It's just a great option to have for casual/budget guitarists."
B000CCJP4I Gives a nice warped slightly detuned effect to your first at the right settings.(Think Alice in chains, or REALLY distorted live nirvana solo) admittedly not everyone's into the whole grunge tone. But it was what I was looking for.Has some nice shimmers and thickening on other settings too.And hey, you can pretty much get it for pocket change."
B000CCJP4I I have yet to find a pedal that can match this little guys desired effect......  If you know how to use it, it really delivers a good effect."
B000CCJP4I its sound pretty good .. i mean , the range /rate arent as broad as others i've tried ..but i stomp on it regularly.. it cuts my signal a bit .. so i compensate ,,an always leave a bit of extra volume in the bank to make it up..all in all=worth it."
B000CCMWVG I shopped around local music shops and was discouraged with the prices. Checked out Amazon and was a little skeptical with the reasonable price, but pleasantly surprised when we received it."
B000CCMWVG I got the $50 standard black on black case.  The case arrived within 2 days via UPS during the middle of the Christmas rush! Wow! Very fast shipping and it was adequately packaged and there was no sign of the box being abused in anyway. Regarding the item itself, I am bit lukewarm. I have a $500 Washburn and wanted something more than a gig bag for going to and from gigs and practice sessions. And I got that. Its lightweight, plenty of room in the gear box and on top of the guitar head.  However, the fit is a bit loose and I don't have the sense that this case will stand up to much abuse over time.  So if you have a pricey guitar or are planning to load you guitar in a truck with other gear, or might ship your guitar or take it on a plane, this case is not the one you want to buy."
B000CCMWVG My Seagull Entourage Rustic fits very snug (I think that is a good thing, not certain) in the case which has a nice faux fur lining and seems well made.I was considering theSeagull Dreadnought Casebut there were no useful pictures or details on the item. I decided to try the Guardian and save a few bucks.Seems like I made a good choice."
B000CCMWVG Guardian?  Well, it is padded, but I've only gigged once since having the item (with 3 rehearsals held prior) and I can say that the case is nicked up \"pretty good,\" as they say in the South.  Yes, it will last, because it is a guitar case, but there's no way there's enough security to protect an instrument on a plane.  Now, that's for flight cases to handle, but don't even come near abusing your instrument while it is housed inside this case, because you may be disappointed to have to buy new parts once the \"guardian\" fails to guard against crushing your hardware.  This item is not one of the better cases out there, but it does suffice, and it does look good.  The first day I got it, someone said, \"nice case, it looks great!\"  Say that now, though, after using it outside the house 4 times, and you'd be a lying SOB."
B000CCMWVG This is a typical inexpensive hardshell guitar case made in China.  I bought it to replace the original (chipboard) case for a 1963 Gibson ES-135 archtop.  Lower bout is 16&#34; wide, upper bout is 12&#34; wide, body is 21 &#34; long, and it's about 5&#34; deep at the bridge.  Fits very snugly in this case which is what I was hoping for.  The case is about 4&#34; longer than the top of the headstock but I didn't expect an exact fit.  The wood shell is thin so don't drop anything on it but it is also lighter than a lot of other cases.  Normal plush fake fur inside with about 3/4 of soft foam all around.  Black tolex on the outside is thin but looks okay.  This is NOT a case to take on the road or if you travel by air but it is adequate for casual use.  Only annoying thing: the case arrived locked.  The keys were, of course, inside the case.  Dumb.  A friend at a music store used a key from another Guardian case to unlock it.  A good reminder that the case latch lock is to keep the latch from popping open and NOT to keep crooks out."
B000CCMWVG Great quality, nice interior, and fits my Yamaha F335 perfectly. Solid and steardy case that will last a very long time."
B000CCMWVG my fav cases ever"
B000CD1R7K Good quality, strong and excellent finish. Nicely priced. A foot rest will help you maintain a good posture while playing, a must for classical players."
B000CD1R7K It does exactly what it says it does.  My only complaint is I wish it could go a notch or two lower.  But very pleased.  It's cheap and works like a champ"
B000CD1R7K It's a great versatile foot rest that any guitar player can benefit from, very good value at only $10 not counting shipping, very satisfied."
B000CD1R7K I've been on a guitar accessory shopping spree lately, and this is my favorite purchase as of late.  I've bought nice straps, but when I'm practicing for hours at a time, this foot rest is a great reprieve, and literally a weight off my shoulders."
B000CD1R7K Was using a box and this is a great help.  My stomach doesn't feel wrenched anymore.  I use it on my right leg with the guitar on the right leg.  Maybe not as conventional as the classic position but it works for me."
B000CD1R7K Great foot rest, it's not flimsy.  But it's not light weight.  I put it in my guitar bag to carry with me and I definitely feel that it's there.  I like that it's adjustable to various heights.  I am short (5'1\") so I usually have it on the highest setting to prop up my left leg when I'm playing classical guitar to get the guitar at the right angle.  But I sometimes adjust it down when I switch it to my right leg and when I'm playing Flamenco and rather than rest the guitar between my legs like in the classical posture, I shift it over to my right leg.  I ended up getting a 2nd one so that I keep the one at the highest setting for when I'm playing classical, and then the other one at the lower setting for my Flamenco playing.  Great foot rest, I recommend it."
B000CD1R7K Just what I needed to position my guitar while seated.  I was worried it would not hold the weight, but it does well."
B000CD1R7K I was looking for a foot rest for a good value and that is exactly what I got.  There isn't too much to say about it.  It's sturdy.  It's adjustable.  It's a great price.  It really made playing easier for me."
B000CD1R7K This little foot stool is really sturdy. It stays in place beautifully. No rocking sideways, no wobbly action.If one of the notches doesn't do it for you, you're screwed: There's no gradual adjustment. But the positions it allows make sense for 99% of players."
B000CD1R7K "
B000CD1R7K This is heavy, but strong.  Very comfortable, I cannot carry it around with me, but it works well at home.  I recommend it."
B000CD1R7K I like this product, but wish it had a wider foot or base to it for carpeted areas, it does get a little unstable on carpet.  Does fine on hard floors."
B000CD1R7K The other reviews for this foot rest called it sturdy and well built. They were right. It can be adjusted to a number of different heights to suit your particular needs - and based on the design of the stand it will stay where it's put. One of the best parts is that while it is stable enough to be the main foot rest where I play my guitar it can be collapsed flat and it easily fits into a bag or backpack - probably around half of the thickness of a chord book, although heavier, as it is steel with a rubber tread on top. It feels like I will own this for a long time - a well priced, good value.Edit2/2013After owning this for around a year and using it every day I find that it still looks and works like new. I recommend it highly."
B00627V4UU while filming this season- 911 happened. I was stunned at what happened to danny Sorenson. I wanted to see more of his character. after losing simone-this was too sudden. new characters emerged and were good too and the flow continued. still made me want to see more."
B00627V4UU I love NYPD Blue because it's so well written, has such great talent, and it is not overwhelmed with sex scenes.  Yes it contains some, but it's not all the time.  The stories are about people on the street and the everyday happenings of a cop shop.  Simply one of the best shows of its kind out there."
B0063BGBO4 Early Bret Easton Ellis novels and their subsequent film adaptations were famous for portrayals of disaffected youth doing naughty things and contemplating life. Now, imagine a handful of characters in their forties doing the same thing, and you've got I Melt With You. Rob Lowe, Jeremy Piven, Thomas Jane, and Christian McKay are old college buddies who meet up annually at Big Sur to celebrate a birthday, but with their own families and hidden secrets plaguing them, they embark on a week of drugs and parties until a tragedy forces them to face their past. Steer clear of I Melt With You, the film's laughable script and ludicrous plot points do nothing to help the actors trying so desperately to make something of the material."
B0063BGBO4 Something is seriously wrong with the first half, and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out what it is- it's incredibly boring due to being plotless.  It's about a group of middle aged party animals that reunite for a weekend (or week) of heavy fun, drugs and drinking but... for over an hour, that's *all* they do.  This might be fun for them but certainly not for us, the viewers.  They drink and do all kinds of drugs, they roll down hills, they drive fast cars, they simply party without taking a break while reminiscing about old times and past girlfriends.However the second half... wow, now *that's* what I call an improvement!  A drastically different turn of events, in fact.  When one of the friends suddenly commits suicide due to past memories coming back to haunt him, this begins a roller coaster ride of emotions and discussions on what to do with the body, and eventually each friend is affected by becoming progressively worse mentally.  They debate whether doing the right thing and calling the cops is what they should do, or.. should they bury the body in the back yard?  After all, they're heavily under the influence of drugs (of course they don't act like they are- storyline flaw there) and a cop would be able to detect this right away.  From here, well let's just say, the emotions really take their toll on each of the friends as tensions rise and accusations fly.Of course it never really made sense how a female cop just suddenly enters the picture without reason, and even worse is the final chase scene.  Without spoiling the final segment, let's just say, why wouldn't she have a gun after it becomes perfectly clear that the suspect she's after is obviously guilty?  Another illogical moment of writing.Either way, it's unforgivable to ignore the first hour of deplorable party time that does absolutely nothing but bore me to tears.  The only time I'm impressed is when classic Sex Pistols and Funkadelic songs are playing.  REALLY good songs too, so at least the soundtrack is up to par which is more than I can say for the rest of the film.  But hey, if you're an incredibly patient person, maybe you'd be able to tolerate the first hour of nonsense just to experience the significantly better second part.  Since so much time is devoted to very little substance however, I have a hard time recommending this one."
B0063BGBO4 I MELT WITH YOU is a disturbing film - in the psychological/ psychosocial sense - but perhaps the most disturbing aspect of it is the fact that the title it is based on a song lyric, suggesting that the story may indeed be more universal than we imagine. To read the lyric is imperative to understanding the film: `(Let's stop the world) I'll stop the world and melt with you/ (Let's stop the world) I've seen some changes but it's getting better all the/ Time / (Let's stop the world) There's nothing you and I won't do/ (Let's stop the world) I'll stop the world and melt with you/ The future's open wide'When four 40-something college friends - Richard (Thomas Jane), Ron (Jeremy Piven), Jonathan (Rob Lowe), and Tim (Christian McKay) - meet up for their annual reunion, things start to spiral out of control, and a suicide pact they made as young men is revisited. A loud, and rather repulsive weekend of hardcore partying with drugs, alcohol, and sex - a binge in the beautiful Big Sur area - leads them to recognize that now they're all middle aged and not really happy about the directions their lives have taken. The fact that in their younger they made a pact while under the influence of drugs that if they were unhappy as middle-aged men, they'd kill themselves a pact they signed in blood. One of the men - Tim - is gay and is the most distraught and his decision to carry out the pact drives the remainder of the story to its end.This sad but conceivable story was written by Glenn Porter who with director Mark Pellington wrote the screenplay.  The dialogue borders on inane at times but the theme of the film is riveting. It is a disturbing story that only grows in the degree of wastefulness of lives in retrospect. Grady Harp, September 12"
B0063BGBO4 Firstly, let me tell you this film is about four friends and a week they spend together. They're all 44 years of age and the characters are varied. One is a self respecting artist/writer who says the artist should not be cynical, then you have a doc who is estranged from his family and his ex wife is remarried and he is suffering from helplessness blues, then you have an interesting sad happy homosexual man and lastly a regular guy with competitive genes. Four of them are trying their best to run away from their miseries during this get away and there is always some awesome music playing in the background. The music is an easy 10. The cast is mostly people you've seen on HBO (Entourage, West Wing, Hung..) The storyline is unique and I felt a constant surge of energy. If I could change something about the film, I'd add a few more sensitive dialogs without making it seem a little pushed. The editing could have been a little more \"free\" and that would have set it free. I can picture this film not doing too well and tanking completely but it had a few unique situations and conversations but towards the end like it's characters it ends up drugged and hungover which is why I really liked it, I guess. It was honest in that sense but a little more intelligence and... Anyway, thank you film-makers for the wonderful sound track, I have discovered some 10 good songs and varied artists. It is a good portray of the human condition and a dialog by Sasha Grey is quite possibly the best scene in the film. WATCH IT!"
B0063BGBO4 Mark Pellington's I MELT WITH YOU is less a traditional narrative film and something more experimental; something more akin to a visual performance piece and not necessarily so much about the plot or dialogue. However, that's not to say that dialogue or plot don't exist. They're there and they're strong, and as far as performance is concerned, this ensemble is pretty impressive.Richard the writer (the always excellent Thomas Jane), Ron the financier (the terrific Jeremy Piven), Jonathan the doctor (The mostly under-appreciated Rob Lowe) and Timothy the question mark(the completely unknown Christian McKay) are four old college friends now all at 44 years of age who made a pact to meet up every year for a Spring Break getaway from family and work and all the pleasures/stresses those cause and have a week together in their own private Land-Of-Do-As-You-Please. Multiple glasses of alcohol are ingested. A smorgasbord of drugs are swallowed, snorted, inhaled and injected, partially as a gift from Jonathan the doctor. Richard brings some human party favors in young nubile female and male company (included is former adult star turned serious actress Sasha Grey). 80's Music is played constantly and loudly. They laugh as they reminisce and there is the sensation of freedom from the reality of their current lives, but it's exceedingly short-lived. Richard is a former writer-turned-teacher and serial womanizer; Ron is happily married with a great family but his financial shortcuts are catching up to him; Jonathan is wholly disillusioned with his profession and has reduced to selling fake painkiller prescriptions as well as being a divorcee with a young son who calls his step-father \"daddy\" now; Timothy is still grieving over the loss of his boyfriend 5 years prior.This week will be very different than the 22 that preceded it, though, and it will not end well for any of them.Things start out amicably enough, but as the week progresses, the group spirals out of control and a descent into what some might consider drug-addled madness but is actually something deeper and more meaningful for the four of them. Things become even more tense when the local town sheriff (the very talented and lovely Carla Gugino) begins to suspect there are darker things going on at the house these men have rented for the week.Mark Pellington, best-known for the dour domestic terrorism thriller ARLINGTON ROAD, goes back to his roots as a music-video director (where he is best known for the unforgettable video for Pearl Jam's haunting \"Jeremy\")as peppered generously throughout the film are brief flashes of the past, present and future, and meditative shots of the water, sand and rocks that surround their rented house in Monterey which is more evocative of Terrence Malick's work. It's an odd mix of smash-cut editing and longer and more visually arresting takes, and it's as disorienting as the constant haze of drugs and alcohol our characters are in.This film does suffer at times from what have come to be referred to around the internet as \"First World Problems\"; which is essentially a bunch of good-looking white men sit around a campfire and complain about their sex lives, their lack of wealth, and how unsatisfying their future is from how they were as kids. That was a big problem for me with Lisa Chodolenko's THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT, but these problems become alternately more and less significant as the film reaches its second act where a drastic, desperate and tragic act leads these men to re-evaluate their problems against the vow they made to one another all those years ago. The whole rest of the film hinges on the importance of this vow, but the vow remains non-specific (but implied) until the very end.Aside from Pellington's expert use of the visual style in this film, the performances from the leads are range from very solid to downright awesome. Jane is absolutely mesmerizing in this film, as is Piven. Their characters really have the heavy lifting to do from a dramatic standpoint and they carry the emotional core of the film effortlessly. Both McKay and Lowe do very solid work here, but sadly their characters feel somewhat short-changed with the prominence of Jane and Piven. Gugino unfortunately has little to do, but is utterly convincing when she's doing it. The various supporting characters, such as Tom Bower playing an ancient mariner and the aforementioned Grey playing a somewhat spiritual and redemptive madonna/whore type have even less to do, other than spout some wisdom or forgiveness.It's definitely not a film not for everyone. While having a linear narrative, it still may be somewhat troublesome for a more literal-minded viewer. Personally, while being a somewhat upsetting and nihilistic film (something Jane seems to do very well: see THE MIST), it's also a very powerful and beautiful film about bonds that stretch across the years and the promises we make to our friends. The symbolism can get a little too heavy-handed and ham-fisted occasionally, but the rest of the film makes up for that.Also, killer soundtrack."
B0063BGBO4 The acting was great but the movie felt like it was dragging on.  The drug use took away from character development and the plot was lacking.  With such a great cast, I was expecting something better.The sound track was good though."
B0063BGBO4 There are two questions one has to propose after watching an overwrought parable of a film like \"I Melt With You.\" Is the movie any good? And is it worth watching? I know some who feel these answers are always the same, but I don't. If someone asked me if Mark Pellington's outrageous examination of middle-aged regret was good, I'd have to say no. So over-the-top and patently ridiculous, the movie is an absolute mess tonally and thematically (even to the point of morphing into a thriller for its conclusion). But is it worth watching? There's something to be said about the absolute madness of it all that makes \"I Melt With You\" sickly fascinating. Even as I was laughing at how inept the story line felt, the movie kept pushing into greater and greater outrageousness. And I must admit, there is an odd entertainment factor to be gleaned from this unpredictability. While it may not be a \"good\" movie, it patently refuses to back down and play it safe. I respect that as well. My rating, therefore, is divided. I give it one star on merit and three stars for its bold commitment to lunacy. Overall, I'll make it two stars and predict that this is the love-it or hate-it proposition of the season.The movie introduces four childhood friends who get together once a year for a week of insane debauchery. Without much preamble or development, we meet the guys briefly in their everyday lives before they assemble at an isolated chalet. Thomas Jane, Jeremy Piven, Rob Lowe, and Christian McKay play the quartet and it's clear that, as a whole, they've been a pretty privileged bunch. But looks can be deceiving, or so the screenplay would have you believe. Each man is haunted by regret and the life not chosen. Despite being successful professionals (some with families), the trip instantly devolves into a drug-fueled music video of bad acts and excess. The movie, in these early scenes, has so little plot momentum that it seems a repetitive (and rather silly) glorification of poor choices and a complete disconnection with recognizable humanity. As each man faces his supposed demons and idealizes a more innocent time, the movie slows down to hear their hard luck stories. But one tragedy and a childhood promise will forever change these men. I won't reveal any more than that, other than to say that the movie just gets systematically more loony as it progresses.With pulsing music, disjointed camera work, and absolute hysterics, the movie becomes a preposterous thriller. To their credit, the actors never waver and all serve up deliciously over-the-top interpretations of \"real\" people. I know some will consider the subject matter provocative and thought-provoking, but it's so far out there--you can't take any of it seriously. But by the time the film enters its final 45 minutes (and the great Carla Gugino shows up), the movie has jumped a school of sharks (not just one) to enter bad movie nirvana. It's so bad, it's good! I'm not sure how anyone would get deep meaning out of \"I Melt With You,\" although its central premise is sound enough. If you do, however, good on you! For me, it's a master class of excess that takes itself way too seriously and thus becomes an absolute treat for lovers of bad movie mayhem. Without the slow start, maybe I'd have rated this higher for the delirium! As is, though, I hated it AND loved it (but for all the wrong reasons), yet am hard pressed to actually recommend it. Despite those that will proclaim it some sort of modern masterpiece, there's a reason its critical consensus on Metacritic is 26 out of 100. KGHarris, 8/12."
B0063BGBO4 This is actually a painful movie to watch and although the Richard character is truly disturbing ifnot despicable, the others are pretty well not worth watching at all.  There is so much drug and alcoholuse that the humanity is erased from the film.  Awful.  Do not bother unless you yourself are part ofthis drug culture that's being portrayed."
B0063BGBO4 This film is actually a lot better than I expected. Five college grads reunite at a beachhouse getaway for the weekend, when things go horribly wrong from depression and a plethora of drugs to add to the mix."
B0063BGBO4 Mark Pellington's Sundance disaster, titled 'I Melt With You', is one of the strangest, incredibly maddening and tonally challenged films that I have seen all year. There are pros and cons - more of the latter than the former - and it is easy to see why so many critics have slashed it to bits. With that being said, it is certainly not as bad as everyone thinks it is, but it could have been a whole hell of a lot better.The film focuses on the yearly reunion of four friends who went to college together in the eighties. Every one of these individuals somehow failed to live the dream, and as a result, they have taken questionable paths in life. Over the course of a drug-filled week, the men reminisce on the past, proceed to wax philosophical on the present, listen to the music of their youth, party with girls, drink obscene amounts of hard liquor, snort mountains of coke, and pop every pill known to mankind. Between this foursome, moments of sobriety are extremely rare - the main characters remain intoxicated for at least two thirds of the running time.The 'Big Chill' meets 'Scarface' vibe comes to a screeching halt when one of the men, racked with guilt over the death of his lover, commits suicide - a tragic occurrence which is partially linked to a pact the four men made twenty five years ago, which all of them, save for one, managed to forget. You read that correctly. Twenty five years prior to this particular reunion, these boys made a binding promise to one another - a contract, signed in blood. When the film reveals exactly what the promise entails, it is a shocking discovery.This begins a downward spiral that neither one of them can escape. It is here that the tone of the film changes for the worse, and as a result, becomes more than a bit preposterous. The cast includes Thomas Jane, Jeremy Piven, Rob Lowe, and Christian McKay. The performances are hit (Christian McKay) and miss (just about everyone else, especially Thomas Jane).The first half of the film is pretty decent, and I was disappointed to see it devolve so quickly. What could have been an extremely provocative study of broken dreams and arrested development becomes a hopelessly melodramatic pile of drivel.Rated R, 122 minutes, directed by Mark Pellington, released by Magnolia Pictures. Available on Blu-ray and DVD on February 28th from Magnolia Home Entertainment."
B0063ONN9C My daughter keeps asking to watch season 1 again even though we have season 2....not sure what that's about. The writing seems as vapid as usual to me. Whatever...."
B0063ONN9C I used to hate this show, but I guess it finally grew on me. My daughter is obsessed with it so I guess after a while I started to see the appeal. The songs are cute, the characters are cute too. The colors are bright and the animation is great. I like that the characters look different (they aren't all little white kids) and that there are boy mermaids! How darling! Also, Mr. Grouper is a teacher. Usually on tv teachers are portrayed as women and men are portrayed as wanting nothing (wholesome) to do with children. In the &#34;time for lunch&#34; segment at least one of the kids (usually Oona for some reason) has a healthy lunch item like a veggie burger or carrot sticks. I always think it's positive to show children enjoying healthy snacks, even if they are cartoon mermaid children.My daughter loves Nonni and Deema. Nonni is precious and his deadpan humor is in stark contrast to the antics of the other characters. Deema is a little diva (I think we all know a little girl like this) and my daughter loves her hair. She loves to draw swirls and say it's Deema's hair.Her favorite episode is the one with the witch (voiced by Wanda Sykes) who wants to turn everyone into frogs. The songs and story are very creative. I thought it was sweet how they made the Big Bad Wolf a total sweetheart and the Giant a softie.To be honest, I don't think it's very educational. I know it makes attempts at education but I really don't think it comes across. I don't mind letting my daughter have a bit of shallow entertainment in small doses, since she is advanced for her age. But for kids and parents there are more educational shows."
B0063ONN9C Our 14 month old absolutely loves it!!! Hums the theme song all day long!"
B0063ONN9C The songs are catchy and the characters and stories are super cute.  We are totally on the guppy train in this house :)"
B0063ONN9C I do really like it. It was very, very good because teach little lessons, dance and sing and just have fun.  It's a show that makes me laugh!"
B0063ONN9C My child loves this show.  It's great to watch them interact and learn.  I totally recommend it for any pre-schoolers"
B0063ONN9C My 3 1/2 year old granddaughter loves this series.  So happy to see it is available on Amazon, now she can watch whenever she likes."
B0063ONN9C Wonderful, family entertainment.  This program is both educational and delightful!  I love watching it with my son."
B0063ONN9C My toddler says bubba ga (bubble guppies) within 10 feet of seeing a tv. He loves all of the singing, Its educational so why not, 3rd season here we come"
B0063ONN9C Cute show.  My kids love it, especially my 21-month-old daughter.  She asks for it by name frequently!"
B0063ONN9C My 2 year old son loves this show! I am so glad he is able to watch it through amazon prime on my kindle! Cute, educational and fun!"
B0063ONN9C This is a fun show. My 2 year old granddaughter loves it. She has learned things from it and loves to &#34;sing&#34; and dance with the guppies."
B0063ONN9C My granddaughter loves Bubble Guppies, and watches them as often as possible!  She is 4 years old.  It's colorful, has a catchy tune, and good story lines."
B0063ONN9C My preschooler loves the Bubble Guppies!  It's colorful.  The stories are great.  But, best of all the music is top notch.  There are some children's shows that can drive you insane with the music, but Bubbly Guppies will have even adults singing along.  We're so glad this is on Amazon Prime now."
B0063ONN9C Kiddo adores this show. She love, love, loves the music and asks to watch the songs again and again. She even tries to copy the dancing! She's also learned a ton from the show. All those Mr. Grouper let's think about its she has memorized the answers and not just repeats them, but understands them. She even memorized the songs down to who dances/sings in the background on each one. It's like a kid magnet! If I play this when we're traveling random children drift over to us in the airport to look over her shoulder! Usually when we're at home I let her watch one show a day after lunch/before nap and it's usually this, Umizoomi, or a Go, Diego, Go (she's animal obsessed). Hope she continues to love it because she &#34;discovered&#34; this around the same time as Sesame Street and she's very over sesame. This keeps going strong!"
B0064JGWZS This is definitely a weak series. It's an interesting premise but I just found so much of it cliched and PC'd out it's hard to swallow. First of all the very silly idea that some ex-rebel soldier would chase various people, even be able to do that much after a chaotic war, in order to get revenge for his wifes death-GAG. The main character has such wooden acting it's hard to care much about anything he does, even cold blooded murder in revenge. Some ex-slave owner part of the despotic South is hard to have much sympathy for. Oh and he's a saint too he just pays the ladies of the evening for services not rendered because of his noble nature-GAG. This is all just blather.This IS a ripoff of Deadwood down to the 2 friends looking to make an enterprise in a dangerous place, the Irish film projectionists(see Deadwood if you don't know who I'm comparing them to). I could care less about them too. Ugh the PC cliches just abound here. Everyone's represented, the blacks, the Indians, the British heroin, the evil bossman and yes the wronged rebel so sad-GAG. Everyone gets their small piece of heaven in each episode here so we can all get our pre-ordained PC helping.For anyone used to watching the HBO/Showtime stuff this is just too weak and shallow. Now I'm sure all you people who bought this will disagree, of course if you bought it you disagree! Ever notice how that works? It's hard to be critical of your own choices or yourself isn't it?This review is not for those who have bought this(or are paid to give good reviews) it's for those looking for an honest opinion of this series who are thinking of watching it or buying it."
B0064JGWZS AMC is still making the best shows on TV, and this one is near the top.  It takes a while to develop the characters, but if you stick it out then the wait is well worth it."
B0064JGWZS Finally the technical problems are resolved!SPOILERS:Chaos reigns in Hell on Wheels. Just desserts are delivered to the Swede. Rewards and loses come to others. While Bohannan's guilt and rage lead him to go too far."
B0064JGWZS I have watched many westerns with my Dad and this is one of the best! It tells about the beginning of the railroad and how the people have lived besides the main story about a Civil War Veteran that is looking for revenge toward the men that killed his wife and son. I can not wait for Season 3 to start on Aug. 10th!!"
B0064JGWZS You know, I've got my Dad to thank for getting me into Westerns. Starting out with the likes of Gene Autry and Roy Rogers, going onto John Wayne and onto shows like The Lone Ranger-The Rifleman and then onto Gunsmoke-Wild Wild West and the like. I'vw watched them pretty much all my life and enjoy them very much. Heck, a time or two- I've even picked novels by Louis Lamour-Robert B. McNeill-Zane Grey and others and read them. I guess a part of me wishes I existed during them days so I could roam the plains and see the beautiful splendor of the outdoors. Anyhow, because of my love for Westerns, I happen to be talking to a friend one day about viewing Streets of Loredo recently. I told him how I enjoyed it but couldn't find any new Westerns out there that I hadn't already seen at some point(I am 45 years old, mind you). He recommended Hell On Wheels. The only thing he really told me about it was that it took place after the Civil War and that it involved the building of the transcontinental railroad. I was somewhat reluctant on getting it. Then, one day, my better half and I were renting a movie from Redbox when I'd seen the first five episodes available on DVD...so, I gave it a shot.It goes alot deeper than my friends' initial description of the show. It centers on a Confederate soldier who's out to exact revenge on the Union soldiers who murdered his wife. He ends up following their trail to the traveling town of, you guessed it, Hell On Wheels.The First Season does have its' moments but, for the most part, is a hard-hitting Western series that fans of Deadwood and the like will love.  If you'll notice, reviewers(inlcluding me) keep bringing up Deadwood. The reason is the show is well-written, the characters grow on you and it always keeps you coming back."
B0064JGWZS Interesting idea.  There are a lot of positives -- modern take on a western, shows some of the US expansion following the Civil War.  Good start."
B0064JGWZS I love to watch this show. And I'm not going to lie to you the main reason is because Anson Mount is so Hot. He really is the reason I started to watch the show."
B0064JGWZS I love the show as I said in the title and I'll say it again it is just great. I think the appeal for me is I like the character of Mr. Bohannan (Anson Mount) he really is the whole show and his character development has been great. I might even have a slight man crush on him I can't quite tell. I mean the show was not without its flaws but I don't agree with some of the directions some of the characters have taken (head shot) but still a great show and I'm excited for season 2.So to somebody who likes westerns likes cowboys and Indians and things like that this is a great series with high production value, great acting and amazing sets. They really set the stage for the time and you never feel a break from that period of time.Oh and one last thing I just love Mr. Bohannan's voice as you can tell from the title hopefully you read \"Yeah that seems about right\" in his voice because one of his lines from one of the shows and that's how I say it and I LOL every time.Enjoy the show as I know you will."
B0064JGWZS When I first heard about \"Hell on Wheels,\" I really thought it might be yet another unforgettable series. Instead, this is entertainment PLUS, all the way through Season One, that will have you waiting for the next Season, too (or is that, Two?)!Anson Mount is simply terrific as Cullen Bohannan and Colm Meaney is always a pleasure to watch! Great to see Monk's Ted Levine in a totally different role (though he doesn't make it through all of Season One!) and finally, a word of warning: the violence can get REALLY violent!I loved \"Deadwood\", but Hell on Wheels has made me forget all about it!"
B0064JGWZS I am a fan of historical fiction when it is done WITHOUT a political agenda. Good historical fiction sticks as close to the truth as possible to educate as well as entertain. Sometimes the writer needs to improvise to keep the storyline flowing--but it also should be as close to the truth as possible.The writers REPLACED the Irish immigrants who were the majority immigrant population who built the eastern portion of the railroad (along with Poles, Italians, Swedes and Germans) with arrogant &#34;in-your-face&#34; Farrakhan blacks. The Chinese who built the western portion are barely mentioned. I am an advocate of giving credit where credit is due and to write a series given blacks credit for what others have done I find insulting.I will not buy the politically correct Hollywood formula &#34;White/Black/Female&#34; second season."
B0064JGWZS I have read all the reviews here at Amazon about Hell On Wheels.  Most people get all defensive and say it's just \"deadwood light\" or something along those lines.  Admittedly, I have never seen Deadwood, so I don't know if these two are similar or not.  What I can tell you is this; I've read the show summary for Deadwood and I've watched Hell On Wheels.  Just from what I've read about Deadwood, it's nothing like Hell On Wheels as far as show plot.  Deadwood is mostly about general western reenactment and everyday life in what the real wild west would've been like.  Although I am sure there are alot of similarities in how the shows look and feel, Hell On Wheels differs in alot of ways.  Hell On Wheels is a modern day western show about building a railroad in the west, which sets it apart from Deadwood.  I've not read anything remotely close to that in the reviews for Deadwood.  In fact, the only real influence from Deadwood that makes it onto Hell On Wheels is some vague character similarities.With all of that being said, I'm not even gonna mention Deadwood at length anymore.  I'm not interested in that show.  I am, however, a big fan of Hell On Wheels.  It's a unique concept that has great plots and well-defined characters that makes this show compelling television.  From Cullen Bohannon to Thomas Durante to Robert Bell and his wife[forgetting her name] to Ferguson[Common's character].  All of these individuals make for intriguing on-screen dynamics with multiple implications and story plots that make you truly appreciate the effort AMC gave this show.  It's something that definetely stands out in AMC's television show lineup and something any casual western lover would enjoy.  And unlike old school westerns, Hell On Wheels has a consistent pace with a great story that does not drag on or dance around the point.  It's simple, straightforward storytelling that speaks for itself and goes directly at the audience.  Also unlike normal western television Hell On Wheels is not too dark.  It has elements of realism in its portrayal and is dark but not so much so that it looks gloomy[as Deadwood seems just by initial appearance].  Hell On Wheels has humorous moments while also remaining true to how a real western railroad work crew camp would look & feel like.  Just watching the bonus features on how they made the look of the show proves how much effort the show creators took into recreating authenticity.  To me, Hell On Wheels is a unique show that may take elements from past shows or westerns, but also stands on its own as completely different entity to itself.  It's not \"deadwood light\" or anything else in my opinion.  It is Hell On Wheels, a great show that deserves to be on television for awhile if the show keeps a consistency to it and doesn't overdo it or overexaggerate.  I could see this show lasting for at least 5 seasons or better if done right."
B0064JGWZS Given as a gift! they loved it and are waiting for me to get the nest series in this collection!!!!"
B0064JGWZS I'm on the fence on whether or not I'll get another season. But I liked it enough to where I will keep it.  (If I don't like a DVD I purchased, I send it on to friends who might.)  I would actually rate it 3 1/2.  A little violent, but not quite as bad as other shows I've seen."
B0064JGWZS My wife and I recently had the delight of taking a guided tour through the streets of Tombstone, Arizona.  We're both history nuts, and our guide - a retired doctor who's gone about researching the peoples and places of the famed city for his own purposes - peppered his 2 and  hour presentation with modern pop culture references in order to help bring the days of the Wild West back to life.  In terms of authenticity at depicting the struggles of daily life for common folks, he rated two television programs very high.  The first - we guessed right - was DEADWOOD; the second was a bit of a welcome surprise: AMC TV's HELL ON WHEELS.HELL ON WHEELS appeared on AMC's schedule with relatively little pomp and circumstance ... at least, little by comparison to their competing programs MAD MEN and THE WALKING DEAD, which were given red carpet treatment.  The small, comfy Western's first season came and went with little critical acclaim, though it currently garners a respectable score of 63 on Metacritic's tracking poll.  Starring a practically unheard of Anson Mount in the lead, along with strong character actor Colm Meaney in a sizable secondary role, HELL ON WHEELS is `the story' of the old West, of pioneering a frontier and making it hospitable for the men, women, and children coming to populate it, all with a healthy bit of gunslinging vengeance thrown in for good measure.Cullen Bohannen (played by Mount) harbors a mystery: he's on a personal vendetta to find and kill the men who raped and murdered his wife while he was away fighting the Civil War.  In order to `fit in' inconspicuously amongst with the unruly types populating the expanding Western frontier, he takes a job as a crew chief for Thomas Durant (Meaney), rail baron.  However, Durant's sheriff - `The Swede' (Christopher Heyerdahl) - suspects Bohannen is secretly up to no good, and he goes forever out of his way to keep the man under his thumb.  The track will be laid, blood will be spilled, and vengeance will be had ... but at what costs to the players involved?What's particularly fascinating about the program is that - strictly from a character dynamic - Bohannen never knows who to trust, and this keeps the audience on the edge of its seat.  He's an effective boss, but he's constantly on his guard against others wanting the `top job' and willing to weasel it out of him.  Durant clearly suspects Bohannen's motives, but he's beholden to him at the same time for getting the tracks laid.  Lily Bell (Dominique McElligott) - a widower with strong ties to the train business - wants to trust the man, but she's drawn into her own affairs to set right the legacy of her late husband.  To its strengths, WHEELS becomes a kinda/sorta Western noir as the roles of `ally' and `adversary' always seem to be in flux for our main character.Also, the expansion of the frontier - the building of the railroad - serves as a metaphor for all the stories here.  No gains are made without great personal effort and sacrifice.  With each new stretch of track comes another turn into unsuspected treachery - be it financial, spiritual, or even territorial as the local Indian tribes seek to stop the `black beast' rampaging over their land.  But, in order to grow, something must be torn away first - or be crushed under the locomotive's mighty steam-driven wheels - and the frontier promises to always extract its price.Bohannen's primary storyline - vengeance - comes and goes throughout the course of the first season; it plays strongly into the pilot episode, as well as significantly in the season finale, but along the way he's allowed to grow a bit and come to grips with the consequences of his actions.  Where it'll all go is a mystery as the season ends on a bit of a dramatic upheaval (no spoilers, just a massive set-up that might change the stakes for all involved) ... but I'll definitely be on board once the train heads out again for the next season.If there is any weakness to the stories here, it's the prevalence of interracial relationships.  For some reason, it seems as if the writers were intent upon putting everyone through the ropes so far as `race matters' was concerned.  Granted, you've got your `whites,' your `blacks,' and your `native Americans' all thrown together at a time when the cultural melting pot was boiling on the stove, but I'd rather the program dial back the blossoming romances every-which-way and continue to tell great stories of exploration.  Bohannen's search for justice has enough teeth to carry the main narrative for a respectable amount of time; layering on secondary romance after romance only dilutes the tales into yet another `spin' on race relations that, so far, carries the same moral of the story: \"try to get along regardless of color, folks.\"  Plus, there's plenty of gibes made at the expense of the Irish.  Seriously, by the end of the season, I was hoping that the writers played out the race card so that it appears only sparingly in the episodes yet to come.  It grew tired real quick.Mount, in particular, does an impressive turn as the principle gunslinger here.  For a talent whose rarely been seen on the big and small screen, he brings a wit and a charm to his grizzled stare, and the West comes alive with the crack of his pistol.  He's an everyman plunged into an antihero's journey - a jaded past and a jaded future - every bit as mean and lean as the circumstances require of him.  Meaney feels a bit miscast, at times, but, as the season progresses, his character thankfully gets fleshed out a bit more.  The true grit here, though, goes to Heyerdahl's Swede; he chews scenery every time he's on the screen - a great foil to Mount's main thrust - and it'll be a pleasure to watch where this ticket takes him.HELL ON WHEELS is produced by a partnership of AMC with Entertainment One Television, Nomatic Pictures, (gayton)2, Endemol, Endemol Entertainment UK, and H.O.W. Productions.  DVD distribution is handled through Entertainment One.  The disc is solid with exceptional video and audio production qualities; it looks and sounds terrific.  Music is used to terrific effect throughout the first season, at times sparse and, other times, haunting.  There's a great array of special features, including several `making of' shorts and character bios as well as some additional focus providing key insight into the narrative of several episodes.  If you're looking forward to season two, then you'd do well to bone up on these in order to better grasp where the show may be headed when it comes back to the small screen.STRONGLY RECOMMENDED.  Fans of HBO's late foray into the contemporary Western DEADWOOD would do well to discover HELL ON WHEELS' charm; it isn't as obviously vulgar or gritty, but it captures the mystique of that certain time and place of the days long ago with equal emphasis on delivering a quality show with exceptional (if not minimalist) production qualities.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Foundry Communications provided me with a DVD screener of HELL ON WHEELS: COMPLETE FIRST SEASON by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review."
B0064JGWZS I truly enjoyed watching this series- it has so much going for it. The setting is the backbone of \"Hell on Wheels\", and it convincingly brings this strange community (a camp of laborers at the western frontier, where the Union Pacific Railroad is being expanded upon and slowly extending its reach across the United States) to life. I could feel the filth and desperation of this world, as well as the aching backs and blistered hands of the men who were worked to the bone by their merciless \"walking bosses\".Equally strong are the actors who were cast to bring the characters of \"Hell on Wheels\" to life. The two protagonists, Mr. Bohanan and Mr. Ferguson, are absolutely fantastic. Though deeply flawed, I could not help but find myself rooting for them... even though they were oftentimes at odds with each other, making for a somewhat muddled viewing experience. But that is by no means a complaint. This is the result of brilliant writing (and acting), and all who were involved in the process deserve to be commended for their efforts.The only thing holding this first season back from five stars is some tired cliches (the wild eyed preacher, the angry Irishman, etc.), as well as some absurdly gratuitous violence that I feel was included simply because that's the trendy thing to do on cable TV nowadays. I have no problem whatsoever with violence in media, and I thought much of it was well placed in \"Hell on Wheels\". Confrontations between Native Americans and railroad workers made sense, as did the constant disputes among laborers. But do we really need to see things like the well dressed railroad tycoon mutilating bodies in order to make for compelling newspaper photos? The answer is no, my friends. That's in there simply to get a rise out of the viewers. Ugh. Such a boring, tired concept.But by no means should you let these minor criticisms prevent you from watching this series, particularly if you're a fan of period pieces, the HBO series \"Deadwood\" (from which influence was clearly drawn), or American history. This is fantastic television- no question about it. Can't wait for season two."
B0064JGWZS The series deals with the post Civil War expansion westward through the eyes of a former Confederate soldier who lost his wife and only child to Union soldiers.  Bohannon, our hero, joins the railroad crew as he finds a clue to the death of his wife.  Working with the railroad is secondary to his own justice and revenge.Season One is tawdry, dirty, and often horrid in the showing of the wretched life and conditions these men, and many women, were subjected.  Alliances, both easy and uneasy, are born and die as quickly as they are needed or no longer useful.Hell On Wheels has a feel of grittiness from beginning to end.  Some may find this a little too overpowering for their senses. Others will enjoy the series for not sugar coating the ugliness of the times."
B0064JGWZS Hell on Wheels season 1 is raw and fast moving.  A diverse set of characters who show the mix of cultures, including prejudices, that inhabited the Union Pacific's construction camp.  Always absorbing."
B0064JGWZS Is it original? Yeah. Is it poorly done? Yes, definitely. Very bad show. It's hard to care about any of the characters. The actors are just there for a paycheck. If you're a dullard, you'll think this is a great show. If you've seen better, forget it."
B0064JGWZS Historical value. I've actually sent history students home to watch this one. Even the weapons are well thought out for this series."
B0064JGWZS As much as Cullen Bohannon's adventures are interesting, and Colm Meaney's character is compelling, and Tom Noonan is just... wacko, sadly the show doesn't work as well as it should.The show, as another reviewer here pointed out, is DEADWOOD Light. It even uses many of the same tropes as that program did (mysterious and violent yet forthright man; naive yet beautiful recent widow; SOB boss who runs everything in the surrounding area; unconventional and troubled preacher), but that's nothing revolutionary to a Western. These are pretty common all around.The story of the building and connecting of the Transcontinental Railroad is pretty darned compelling, but obviously, that needs to be dressed up a little more: The Black and Irish workers, the side-businesses in the camp, the little pieces of subterfuge and manipulation; this is apparently the drama driving the show forward. Again, sadly, it's just not compelling enough to maintain interest for those who have seen this show before and seen it better cough*DEADWOOD*cough.While freshman showrunners Tony and Joe Gayton (who also wrote the somewhat-entertaining Dwayne Johnson/Billy Bob Thornton B-movie FASTER) deserve props for doing their very best to make this look and feel authentic, the characters and the story are just too bland and too stock (much like FASTER) and the performances, with a few exceptions, don't flesh them out further. I really wanted to like this show, too, since AMC has a few of the very best shows on TV right now. I DVR'd every episode and watched the first four, but everytime I thought about watching a new episode, I just felt like it was a chore, and that is not the feeling you want when you sit down to watch TV. Oh, well."
B0064JGWZS I can not say enough great things about this series. Well written, and the actors are wonderful. I have been searching for a great western type series to watch..and Shazam, here it is. This is a must see!!"
B0064JGWZS Hell on wheels gets much better as the program progresses from one episode to the next. If you only watched the first one or two episodes you may not be very impressed with the show at first. As the episodes progress the characters get more interesting and the story as well. The only problem with this program is that they've taken on a very big subject with a very low budget. If you go to their website and look at the production information you'll see what I mean. Considering the program renewed for another season may be the budget will be bigger and the producers will be able to present a better picture of just how grueling it was to build that railroad. If the storyline has the characters stay in one location as it would appear to be headed at the end of the first season the show will probably not see a third season. With a program like Deadwood you can have a show that is primarily character driven but when you have a show about building a railroad you need more than that. Nevertheless when the program returns in early 2013 I will definitely buy it."
B0064JGWZS By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MSI'm usually a fan of shows or movies which have a basis in history. Hell On Wheels fits that mold.Producers Joe and Tony Gayton got the idea from seeing a documentary.\"We [Joe and I] started talking and remembered this story, American Experience, which was this really great documentary, and I thought, 'God, that's great. I just learned a bunch of stuff I had never learned before.' You just have this cursory information that the Chinese and the Irish built the railroad, but it got in underneath all the dirt and stuff that went on, with the financing of it, and the greed and corruption. ,\" Tony said.The lead character Cullen Bohannon (Anson Mount) is on a mission. The ex-confederate soldier is out to revenge his wife and son, who were killed by Union soldiers. He knows Union soldiers are working with the transcontinental railroad, to protect the venture from outlaws and Indians. He gets a job from Thomas \"Doc\" Durant to supervise an all-black \"cut crew.\"He meets and eventually becomes friends with Common (Elam Ferguson), a recently freed slave, who is trying to figure out what to do with his freedom.Another important character is Lily Bell (Dominique McElligott). Her husband, a surveyor was killed by Indians and she barely escaped. Her husband was partners with Doc, and he had maps which showed the course the railroad must take through the mountains. Doc courts her, mainly concerned on the front end with getting those maps.Hell On Wheels  is a great series, full of potent images, memorable characters and a story line that's believeable and rememberable. It was renewed for a second season."
B0064JGWZS Hell on wheels is a Great series, good story lines, love the chemistry of the cast. I will be getting season 2."
B0064JGWZS This is a very gritty series about building a railroad after the civil war and the trials and tribulations that the workers had to go through.  Lots of little sub-plots throughout that keep things interesting."
B0064JGWZS I very much enjoyed this fast-paced, semi-historical western series. Super exciting and full of suspense. The part I liked the most is that it wasn't like the HBO series \"Deadwood\" that throws out an F-Bomb every minute or two (literally). Sure there is some spicy talk, but it's not overdone in my opinion. There are elements (like the \"Soiled Doves\") that are just saucy enough without being disgusting. I think the blood and gore are a bit much, but every action-film is getting to be like that. Note to Hollywood filmmakers: Not everyone wants to actually SEE a man's head being blown off! We are intelligent enough to get what is happening without seeing a ton of blood and gore. So, anyway, other than a few moments where I had to close my eyes during the action scenes, I was riveted to the screen. Definitely give this series a chance. (Also, the 1st season is better than the 2nd...just FYI)."
B0064JGWZS With all the success that AMC has had recently turning out high quality adult programs such as \"Mad Men\" and \"The Walking Dead,\" few new dramas in 2011 were as eagerly anticipated as their Western revival \"Hell on Wheels.\" Despite a somewhat mixed reaction from the mainstream media, the show was an instant hit when its premiere episode became the network's second highest rated debut in history. And yet, despite these big numbers and impeccable production values, it is still very much a show that is finding its way creatively and dramatically. There are so many reasons to recommend \"Hell on Wheels\" and yet it takes a while to find its footing after a powerhouse beginning. For most of its ten episodes, I found myself admiring the show's technical construction as opposed to loving its storytelling arc.The two strongest components of the show (evident from the very beginning) were its lavish depiction of the Old West with some spectacular battles and effects and a dynamic lead villain in Colm Meaney. The story opens in a post-Civil War America with an enigmatic soldier (Anson Mount) seeking revenge for the murder of his wife by Union officers. His journey puts him in the heart of a railroad construction project led by Meaney at an untamed post on the outskirts of civilization. There are working girls, disgraced clergy, thuggish bosses, newly emancipated slaves, a Native American presence and a myriad of other unscrupulous business types coexisting in this tempestuous microcosm and seeking to exploit the new possibilities on the road west. Meaney is absolutely terrific and other notable performances are turned in by Common (unexpectedly solid as a sometimes ally of Mount) and Tom Noonan (as a preacher trying to reform his life). While the entire cast is quite good, some of the peripheral characters have yet to be developed in any meaningful way.There is no denying that \"Hell on Wheels\" is a handsome and extremely well executed from a technical standpoint. From the sets to the costumes to the effects, there are some pretty spectacular action set pieces and period recreations. It's obvious that many people love \"Hell on Wheels.\" I wished I had been more emotionally connected to the earlier episodes, it took about half of the season before I felt really invested. After that, though, I really loved much of what came next. There are so many strong elements at work here--I was willing to be patient. The skeleton for a improved second season is in place. As long as the show digs deeper into its characterizations, there's no reason to think it can't develop into one of TV's best dramas. Not fully cooked and sometimes relies on too many cliches, but it has enormous potential. And it sure does look great! KGHarris, 5/12."
B0064JGWZS This series is about the contradictions in our national history as we re recovered from the civil war,aftermath of slavery, Indian wars, personal trauma, growing industrialization. The story lines are absorbing and the acting is generally very good with particular praise for Anson Mount as Bohannon, Thor Heyerdahl as Swede, and Ted Levine as Johnson.  Levine plays a railroad overseer who turns out to have played a crucial role in the hero's traumatic past. He is outstanding in the role. I don't want to say more so as not to spoil it for those who have not yet seen the series.If you enjoy historical sagas like Deadwood, Hatfield and McCoys you will enjoy this absorbing drama."
B0064JGWZS A colleague recommended I check out this series and I'm so glad I did.  It's a great story - very different from what is on TV right now.  I will order the second season as well and try to catch the third season when it's on TV.  This was reasonably priced and a great way to be introduced to the series."
B0064JGWZS I stumbled on this series and was blown away. It is the best!  Love everything about it. Acting and casting is first rate. I love Ian Tracy and he is perfect The story is clever..  I can't wait for season 2 starting aug 12, 2012.  The scenery is gorgeous. The star is a hunk too. Can't say enough positive things about Hell on Wheels.  A wonderful example of when film is good it can be really really good!"
B0064JGWZS I wasn't expecting the solid greatness this fantastically written, directed and acted TV series gave me. Most TV westerns of recent years have been a mixed bag. Mostly short series, not ongoing like this one.AMC has really got a winner on their hands here. And thus far season 2 is just as great. If you like your characters deep, and your western action exciting, then Hell on Wheels will fill your bill."
B0064JGWZS This could have been good..it could have been great. But, in order to please blood-thirsty audiences, I assume, too many scenes were sensationalized with blood, violence, and gore and a huge turn-off."
B0064JGWZS This wasn't my favorite show, but my husband sure did like it.  If you are into watching something different, then this is a safe bet."
B0064JGWZS I loved this series on AMC! I preorder this as soon as it became available. It does suck one of my friends that played a Native American on the show had to get killed put it is what it is. If you haven't seen it.. do! It's really great! Highly recommend!"
B0064JGWZS This movie was very very good. I cannot wait to buy the second and third seasons of Hell on Wheels now."
B0064JGWZS There are some things to like in this show and some things to definitely dislike. But first off this is a tale set shortly after the American Civil War, focusing on a Confederate veteran who is seeking several men who did his deceased wife wrong. Turns out these people have gone west to work for the railroad company looking to reach the Pacific Ocean by a certain point. Of course, the tale branches off into several subplots and layered relationships. Colm Meaney, who some might remember from STAR TREK, is best known to me and plays an investor with a stake in this venture as it will hopefully make him his fortune. The outfits and looks of things feel right though the dialogue at times feels a bit too modern. It's slow in the beginning but that's because they're developing several subplots which will eventually overlap. There's some good coverage of relations between Irish and former slaves which is well done and has a great deal of truth to it for the era (both sides were competing for similar jobs), as well as the effects Manifest Destiny had upon the American Indians in the way (anybody else recognize a certain actor from LAST OF THE MOHICANS?) of progress. There are also some nice contradictions in the series, like evangelists preaching alongside hookers at work and talk of fair wages amidst rampant racism. For Deadwood fans I'd say this is better than the third season but certainly not the first and arguably a notch down from the second season. Budgetary concerns kept out Chinese Americans which got criticisms. The show is hoping to rectify this in the second season but it all depends on finances. On that note this premiere was the second most popular of AMC shows to date bringing in 4.4 million viewers. CHARACTER/DIALOGUE: B; STORY/PLOTTING: BVISUAL FEAST SCENERY POTENTIAL: B to B plus; GETS THE PERIOD RIGHT (for TV viewers): B to B plus; OVERALL GRADE: B to B plus; WHEN WATCHED: December 2011."
B0064JGWZS I really enjoy gritty westerns, epecially any with Clint Eastwood, so I like many were amazed with HBO's three season run of Deadwood. Hell on Wheels is nearly as dirty and raw, minus the language and nudity, as that show, but a couple of episodes ran rather slow and at times some scenes were unbelievable. The acting is solid throughout and the main character (featured on the DVD cover) who happens to look like Daniel Day-Lewis is someone I've never heard of before, but does a solid job. Even rapper Common proves he has some acting ability in the sidekick role.Miss Deadwood? Check out the weaker but still entertaining Hell on Wheels."
B0064JGWZS American TV continues its run of quality series with this Western set in post Civil War America.  There is a sense of the familiar in the way the episodes are put together, using the editing and music stylistic choices that have worked well in other quality TV series, but satisfyingly there is also a sense of something new, in the setting and the characters.  The setting is a gritty - well no, lets make that muddy, settlement which houses the workers on the railroad, and moves from time to time to stay where the work is - hence the title.  Into this town of ex slaves, immigrants, criminals and whores, comes an ex-Confederate soldier, on the trail of Union soldiers who murdered his wife.  However the pleasure in the series isn't this slim character arc, but rather getting to know the range of characters who subvert the usual clich&eacute;d expectations in Western - yes, we get the hooker with a heart of gold - but her history is an unexpected one, and yes, we get the lone preacher trying to convert the wretched hive of scum and villainy - but his character is also not as we at first expect.  Even Colm Meaney's magnificent railroad baron is a treat, as he defies expectations and manipulates (and occasionally is manipulated) those around him.  The head of security is a fantastic creation - The Swede, and then there is Common, playing the ex slave, and Dominique McElligott as the Englishwoman who supplies the beauty against the range of beasts on display.  They're all well drawn and well acted characters, which makes this an eminently watchable series.I had the same view as others as I watched this, that it was good to have aDeadwood: The Complete Series [Blu-ray] substitute back on screen - but in fact it's kind of unfair to compare the two.  The settings are quite different, though both maximise the drama by using a very distinct geographically bounded area to set their scene.  They are both down and dirty and show humanity at more lows than highs, but I would suggest there is a hint more optimism here, even if we still have the violence and cursing and whoring.  I am not an expert on the period, but the railroad crews are an interesting point of view to peek into this period of history and convinces as to its authenticity thanks in large part to its utterly committed cast.  I for one am looking forward to the next series..."
B0064JGWZS I admit i wasnt blown away by first episode, but it certainly builds over the season into a great show."
B0064JGWZS Well, if you are looking for a different type of Western series, this is it.  My wife doesn't usually go for Westerns but she thoroughly enjoed this production.  The basic premise is different as well as the really authentic clothing and styles.  I'm glad I didn't live back then; times were really tough and life was a major struggle. I also like Anson Mount in the lead role.  He looks and acts the part perfectly."
B0064JGWZS I love this series and had to have the discs. I plan to watch this many times over. Go Hell on Wheels!"
B0064JGWZS Hell On Wheels - The Complete First Season (2011)I stumbled upon this show by complete accident not being a regular TV viewer. I saw the title featured on Amazon and recalled seeing that term used in the book \"Nothing Like It in the World\", Stephen Ambrose's history of the trans-continental railroad. The term described the nomadic towns that sprang up and accompanied the construction of the nations railroads. I impulsively purchased the First Season and submit the following observations.I was very impressed with the sets, location and, of course, the rolling stock - trains. Having resided in the mid-west for several years - Minnesota - the Canadian prairies looked very authentic to me.From my reading the rail towns were, in fact, lawless and vice was rampant. The survivors of the Civil War, both Union and Confederates were attracted to the wide-open lifestyle. Outward expressions of racial and ethnic enmity was part of the then American culture. Of course dramatic liberties were taken but the basic social interactions portrayed reflect, I believe, the situations, as they actually existed.The actors were unknown to this viewer but were memorable for their roles particularly \"The Swede\" and Joseph Black Moon.One real attractive aspect of the box set are the behind the scenes documentaries that are included. One fact that impressed me no end was that the locomotive used in Season One was made out of wood!I just purchased Season 2 so you know I'll give this series a good rating!"
B0064JGWZS The reviews about poor historical accuracy caused me to hesitate to buy this series. Since I don't know that much about the exact history, any artistic license taken did not bother me. This show is great and the 3rd season is in my WishList."
B0064JGWZS Set Tivo to capture this show when it started and after first, set to get season pass. Interesting, well done, multiple complex character show with old West as backdrop. More than a Western. Some history that seems to ring true even if it actually isn't. Rough and tumble and bloody at times. I do like series and hope to catch all of season 2. Recommend."
B0064JGWZS I had not previously seen Hell on Wheels so ordered just Season 1 DVD'[s.  Loved it, and will probably obtain other Seasons."
B0064JGWZS Deadwood (2004-2005) was the last good &#34;authentic&#34; Western show......until now.  Hell On Wheels does an excellent (and authentic) job of re-creating the era (post-Civil War; dawn of the Transcontinental Railroad), while still mixing in enough drama, sex and intrigue to attract more than just history buffs.  All-in-all, an excellent first season; I just purchased season 2, so we'll see if the legacy continues."
B0064JGWZS Cullen Bohannan (Anson Mount) provides a most interesting protagonist in this realistic post Civil War drama/action series. Cullen is seeking revenge for the defilement and death of his wife during Sherman's destruction of Meridian, Mississippi. As Cullen gets his revenge, he comes to find out there is more to the story. He is unique in that he married a Northern woman, and freed his slaves prior to the Civil War and hired them to work his fields. He also claims no belief in God as he comes across as a second amendment atheist. Rapper Common did an excellent job as Elam.Cullen takes up with the railroad in the wild prairie land as Native American raids become one of many the dangers in this traveling road show known as \"Hell on Wheels\" which includes people who support the men such as prostitutes, preachers, and picture men.While the costume details and history appear authentic, there was one thing that caught my ear: The derogatory word for a Chinese worker (rhymes with clink). The first known use of the word was in 1890. The film starts in 1865. Appears to be some sloppy research.My main criticism of the series is that it moves at a slow soap opera pace.No f-bombs, sex, or nudity in the pilot. Things get a little spicier in the series."
B0064JGWZS Hell on Wheels is set several years after the USA Civil War and concerns the struggles of building the transcontinental railroad.  An interesting time period to explore and very well done set pieces.  It's just shy of HBO's Deadwood in terms of authenticity and character but if you enjoy this time period or \"the old west\" you will enjoy this show.  Good job AMC!"
B0064JGWZS In comparison with much of what is available in the way of westerns, this is a minimally acceptable series.  The plot is interesting, the actors moderately competent, and the set designs and photography convincing.  Obviously, this series is a milksop imitation of Deadwood.  Deadwood was a ten; Wheels is a five.  Unforgivably, the depictions of Native American culture are offensive.  Such caricatures would be expected in a 1940's John Wayne oater but are both atavistic and ridiculous in modern productions.Still, there is enough of interest in Wheels to warrant viewing (if nothing better is available and one is relatively desperate for escapism)."
B0064YPHEK Love the Nature series. Its educational, enlightening and entertaining. There are even some episodes I'm not sure i want to watch ...but they suck me in and i end up enjoying."
B0064YPHEK I liked the premise at the beginning of following the raccoons given collars, but then the focus shifted to other cities.  By the time it shifted back to the Toronto study there was not enough time to get much information.  I think it would have been more interesting to focus on the original study with perhaps just a few remarks about the Japanese and German ones."
B0064YPHEK Is this show about nature or about man involving himself in nature. In episode 1 a terrible narrator who talks way too much throughout the documentary speaks for 15 minutes about how he is within 15 meters of the eagle and the eagle is staring at him. Episode 2 is about a lonely man that raises a dozen wild turkeys from birth. You never actually learn anything except that the man is sad when he loses his turkeys. This show seems more about the people filming them than about nature."
B0064YPHEK What a great series!  I will watch it again and again.  One photographer dug a four foot by four foot pit and lived in it for seven months to get a shot of Siberian tigers!  It's a great series."
B0064YPHEK The nature series is very entertaining while enlightening and does pass on a lot of knowledge. This series should be in curriculums in elementary school."
B0064YPHEK The doucmentary was good.  Interesting but not in great detail.  The poor video quality made it hard to watch.  Interesting about the Harpy Eagle, but I had to go to other websites to get more detailed information"
B0064YPHEK I love Nature but do not have cable TV or a local PBS station to watch so I was happy to see it on Amazon Prime but sadly not a lot of episodes.  Hope they add more at some point."
B0064YPHEK it is just great nature show...heads above those on animal planet and other channels similar such as discovery etc.  watch it"
B0064YPHEK The particular episode I watched about odd animal friends was so heartwarming and so different to see animals grow up together that would usually be enemies.sometimes it's like humans if you aren't yet taught to hate you don't know you aren't supposed to be friends."
B0064YPHEK I like this series. Each episode is interesting and some of them are downright fun! They're not controversial at all."
B0064YPMOU It's so hard to know what is really going on in wars, until we can look back with 20/20 vision at these documentaries.  This series gives a voice to the truth.  My parents said they had no real knowledge of the truth about the Viet Nam war while it raged on and on.I'm a nurse and for many years I've been thanking the few Nam war vets who have been in my care because I knew about the terrible home-coming they received and I truly admired and appreciated the service they gave our country..  As I held the hand of one vet and thanked him..he said: &#34;No one has ever said that to me before.&#34;  to which I replied: &#34;Well..they should have.&#34;Presidents Johnson and Nixon were two of the worst leaders and liars America had seen in it's president's up to that time.  We've had worse since then with the Bush administrations and now we have the worst leader in history with &#34;Puppet&#34; President Obama.In President Kennedy's own words in filmed speeches, he was set against sending troops to Viet Nam.  I believe that is partly why U.S. political forces failed to protect him and helped arrange to have him killed. Who is REALLY running this country and who is really putting these kinds of men into office?  Is it really the voters??"
B0064YPMOU I was still in High School when that war ended for the US but had some recollection of events both in the classroom and newspapers and broadcasts.  I also have an older brother who served two tours there.  This was an amazing piece of documentary work.  Both the visual content and narration was amazing.  I really can;t say enough about this series.  Watch it."
B0064YPMOU This was an excellent series and I highly recommend it to anyone with an interest in this war and the struggles our Soldiers and country faced."
B0064YPMOU One of the best documentaries on the Vietnam War.  Extensive coverage, thoughtful interviews and good footage.  The editing was better than I expected.  Overall, outstanding."
B0064YPMOU I enjoyed watching the series. I enjoy Vietnam movies. I grew up watching the war on television and worrying that I would be drafted into the war. The war ended before I finished high school. Confusing time in America during the war with the protests against war, civil rights movements and riots. It was good to see the soldiers point of view from the private up to the general."
B0064YPMOU decent real footage and objective reporting. Welcome the insertion of facts and events that were not presented before, butexisted non-the-less."
B0064YPMOU *Added 21 January 2014: The latest reviews offer an interesting insight into this series. There are even more reviews than expected and they are less critical! During WWII the 'enemy' was obvious. Vietnam is more easily compared to Afghanistan.Original review date 14 September 2013:How to explain our involvement in Vietnam? How to explain our country divided? This is a beginning to try and help one understand the reality . . .  my generations's war. Photographs and video footage bring a reminder of what happened but cannot give back the lives lost. Familiar and yet different, an intimate view of what happened and what was to come. I found the narration to be well done even it didn't always match the footage. The nightmare scenarios followed one after another and the lessons were learned too late. Who they were, where they were from and what they did, create a video worth watching/listening.['Army Brat' . . . both daughter and wife]The wrenching reality of this series is by far superior to most Vietnam documentaries. The original review remains as written and I have chosen to append these comments after purchasing and viewing the entire series. My own knowledge came from those who served 'in country,' veteran sites and archives. For those who want a simplified comprehensive assessment, this series presents an overwhelming abundance of information for both the personal and political overview.  Thank you to all those who served our country and to those that made this documentary possible."
B0064YPMOU I felt this was the best Vietnam War documentary I've ever seen.  Not only is the war in Vietnam given a broad look, but also what was going on back in the states, and how our vets were treated."
B0064YPMOU A very good albeit short history of the Vietnam war.  Some not before seen footage.  Worth a watch."
B0064YPMOU Very well done. The film footage show a lot of what was happening and took me back to the way things were."
B0064YPMOU This  series should be required viewing for any politician that wants to get the US  into another war.  Very moving sequences and personal  experiences.  Some of the footage was shown repeatedly."
B0064YPMOU This is an older program that aired some time back.  It provides a good and accurate summary of the history and politics of the Vietnam war."
B0064YPMOU Well written and documented with very good images.  It took me back to 1969 very quickly and my time there."
B0064YPMOU I grew up during this war and remember watching some of the things mentioned during tv newscasts. I am not sure how exact it is historically but I feel like it was a good representation of the series of events that happened during this time period in American history"
B0064YPMOU Absolutely fantastic! Shows the real war as it was, not as it was portrayed to be by our government. If you are a war historian then you need to see this program!"
B0064YPMOU This is a greats series. It gives the viewers insights into the minds of the young men and women who served and fought in the Viet Nam war. I am a history buff and study a lot about this period in American history (my father served in Viet Nam in 1966)."
B0064YPSRG This is a quirky romantic comedy about a young man in New York City, who is a pickpocket. He meets a woman and has a passionate affair on a one night stand. She finds out she's pregnant and confronts him with choices and challenges he must make in order to continue the relationship. Very funny, Enjoyable, and Entertaining. Highly Recommended!"
B0064YPSRG First of all, don't pay any attention to any bad reviews, I seriously doubt these people actually watchedthis movie. For an independent, it was quite a surprise. Facinelli does a terrific job with the screenplay abouta pickpocket trying to pay off his Father's $500,000 debt to scumbag Vincent Gallo. Along the way, he manages tolift a badge from Michael Madsen, who works for acknowledged superfreak William Forsythe (in a very subdued role)and then all hell breaks loose.As our lead is being pursued by seemingly the entire NY City police force, his mom breaks bad with Joe Pantoliano,and he \"accidentally\" bumps into and falls in love with the beautiful, but recently impregnated, Jaimie Alexander,with whom he had a one night fling then apparently forgot about.The writing is tight, the characters are well cast, there is humor, drama, intrigue, and romance, and this is MichaelMadsen's best role since ... well since hell I cant remember... a long damn time.Anybody that doesn't like this movie needs their heads examined. For its budget, a solid 4.5 stars."
B0064YPSRG LOOSIES like so many other art house films that take a while to build an audience, but then enjoy a faithful following. But this film is a real find: Peter Facinelli is known to everyone as the head of the Cullen Clan in the vampire TWILIGHT series and as the goofy delusional doc on the NURSE JACKIE TV series (and from roles in a lot of small films where he didn't get the notice he deserved). But who could tell that this tall stud muffin natural comedian could also write? Facinelli came up with the story and wrote the screenplay for LOOSIES and he also stars as the main character - and he is a hands-down winner in each category. Director Michael Corrente seems to let Facinelli have the film and he plays it to the hilt while at the same time molding into a solid ensemble of fine actors.Bobby (Peter Facinelli) is a young pickpocket in New York City, snatching wallets, cellphones, briefcases and money as slick as any pro could perform. He lives with his mother Rita (Marianne Leone, wife of Chris Cooper!) and follows his life of petty crime to pay off his recently deceased father's gambling debt. All his work is turned over to Jax (Vincent Gallo), a filthy clod of a guy who berates Peter's inability to go big time in theft. Bobby is a fairly happy-go-lucky guy until he accidentally encounters Lucy (Jaimie Alexander), a beautiful girl who works in a bar but who Booby happened to have a memorable one-night stand with three months ago. Lucy confronts Bobby, Bobby doesn't remember her name, and when Lucy informs him that their little tryst created a pregnancy, Booby tries to do the right thing and find the money to give Lucy to 'take care of the pregnancy'. This leads to a serious of crazy events: Bobby needs big money, mistakenly lifts a police badge form a cop (Michael Madsen) whose boss (William Forsythe) threatens to fire him unless he can get his badge back. The 'cops and robbers' scene plays out: Lucy doesn't want to be associated with a pickpocket despite the fact there is a newly rediscovered chemistry with the changing Bobby, Bobby resents his mother's finding a boyfriend Carl (Joe Pantoliano) who owns a jewelry store, but plans a gig with Jax to work a deal with Carl to get the cops off his tail and allow him to become the guy he really wants to be.How Bobby makes his way through this complex plot is the magic of the fine writing and the first class acting by the surprisingly hunky Facinelli. Jaimie Alexander is a terrific find, and the cameo roles by Vincent Gallo, Marianne Leone, Joe Pantoliano et al are beautifully realized. 'Loosies', by the way, is the term for loose cigarettes that people can but without investing in a pack. Seeing the film, titled so appropriately, will make the audience sit up and pay attention to Peter Facinelli in a totally new realm of respect. He is VERY good! Grady Harp, April 12"
B0064YPSRG For some writer's block reason a skilled pickpocket doesn't understand high school biology about reproduction and gets a girl pregnant and doesn't understand how it was possible. Duh! Anyway, tediously long script showing the pickpocket art of stealing cellphones to pay a debt to a not-so-nice fence while running from the cops. Stereotypes of coping with the girl's pregnancy and dragging her into the fray only to have her turn his life around. Usual stereotypes of dumb cops, double crosses and redemption. Actors were cast for their respective roles by looks and the robotic acting showed why, Twilight obsessed vamps notwithstanding.A bit concerned with the consistent and continual portrayal throughout the movie that lying, stealing, avoiding responsibility, drinking, bad parenting all were shown in a positive light while the cops come out as conniving drinking dumbasses."
B0064YPSRG A hardly memorized movie of a not-so-bad looking guy avoiding sexual encounters while a story is about his choices as he was accused in making one pregnant during a one night stay.Not much at all."
B0064YPSRG Nice little romantic \"comedy\". One of those where things just go from bad to worse and one has to shake one's head. Liked both main characters and think they did decent acting jobs. Could be a data movie for 25 - 30's.  Recommend as entertainment."
B0064YPSRG I have to say that I am a huge fan of Peter Facinelli, having said that this movie could not have entertained me any more. He did a superb job with the part as did the rest of the cast."
B00669UD0Q A Lonely Place To Die is a solid film.  It's about a group of young Scottish hikers programmed for adventure.  They're quite happy about their journey at first... until one guy from the group goes to take a leak and hears the faint sounds of a little girl crying for help.  They then realize the girl is underground so they dig and dig... and eventually find her.  However there's no time to celebrate I'm afraid, as it's quickly discovered that these hikers are being hunted by two crazy men with guns and a Russian accent (at least I think it's Russian).For the first half of the movie, these hikers are literally running and climbing rocks for their lives as the crazy gunmen continue to stand around, reload and fire at their targets, and hey, if they intended to wipe out the hikers backpacks, they succeeded with flying colors, har har!Anyway the hikers are now on a mission to protect the little girl that they freed and saved from the underground box she was forced to squeeze into, and after the first half with all that intense mountain climbing and careful maneuvering the storyline eventually rolls into town... not sure *which* town exactly, but the gameplan remains the same- protect the girl no matter what.  Unfortunately  now the gunmen are more aggressive than ever.You see apparently the little girl is valuable but I wasn't really sure in what way, and if her importance was explained I didn't catch it (and I even tried as hard as I could to understand the accent of the two gunmen but every so often a few hard to comprehend lines were thrown in there).There's some really graphic segments in this movie.  The one that surprises me the most is the one where two of the hikers were simply climbing down from a mountain and suddenly the guy standing on top of the rocks falls down the mountain to his death on a row of rocks beside a river.  It's an amazingly graphic scene and makes me sick when you realize how fragile life can be for a mountain climber- one wrong move and that's it, you're done.  The woman who was positioned halfway down the mountain turns around and sees her friend falling as it happens, and she lets out a terrifying and realistic scream that really bothers me.Overall, I really like this movie.  The Scottish accents are easy to understand, the woman most persistent on protecting the female child is really beautiful, the acting is fantastic, the action and suspense is constant, and it's just a wonderful movie."
B00669UD0Q This movie requires patience, but if you don't have it just fast forward till it looks interesting.  This is a decent thriller, but not overly thrilling.  I just couldn't get into the characters.  I watched it but I found myself fast forwarding which I don't do very often.  I think perhaps this movie needed better editing, there was to much footage of mountain scenery, parade, et cetera.  Had they trimmed there and developed the characters more it would have been better.  It doesn't take all that much to figure out what is going on, and they dragged us with all the extra footage.  There are some great scenes of them escaping the bad guys, but they needed a bad guy boss on the scene with some character.  The bad guys are okay but nothing made me think, oh those guys really scare me (see John Lithgow's great performance in Cliffhanger).  In fact I think they were made to look so cold blooded I just didn't care about them at all.  The five people on the mountain are decent, but only a couple I halfway felt I knew a little by the end.  The police that try to help are barely developed so once again they are okay.  They needed more screen time because I started to like the black cop, but didn't get time to really know him.  The girls father at the end was more interesting because you could feel his intensity.  All-in-all a pretty decent movie but it had a lot more potential had they developed more of the characters and spent less time on the surroundings. I love scenery and sets, but they don't make the movie, the actors and story do.  At this less than seven dollar price it is worth buying.Recommendations:Shoot to Kill,Cliffhanger, andThe Eiger SanctionCA Luster"
B00669UD0Q In the immortal words of Charlie Brown,\"Argh!\".  This film is terrific for its first two-thirds.  Director Julian Gilbey wratchets the tension in this portion immeasurably.  Gilbey seems to be taking his cues from John Boorman's \"Deliverance\" and Walter Hill's \"Southern Comfort\" in exploring the age old themes of man versus an unforgiving natural terrain combined with threats from his fellow man.  It's in the film's final third where things go terribly awry.  It's here where the film devolves into a second rate \"Taken\" that makes little narrative sense.  I'm ambivalent about recommending this movie.  If you must proceed there's a lot of good stuff but you have to divorce it from the dross."
B00669UD0Q A Lonely Place To Die is a very Atmospheric film that not only has beautiful scenery and cinematography but also packs a punch as far as storyline and execution.The Acting is first rate and it is what it is, there really aren't any big aha moments or unexpected twists.The group of mountain climbers are in a race for their lives and the life of the little girl they saved from a man made underground prison.Many lives will be lost be it the pursuers and /or the Climbers.The main question is why do the men with heavy artillery chasing them want the girl so bad,where did she come from and will she be returned safety and will any of the climbers be alive to make sure she is?One of the best adventure/suspense thrillers of the year in my opinion because it's no nonsense and cuts right to the literal chase.There is quite a bit of violence and blood but nothing that put's it in Slasher mode although I have seen many slashers with less blood.Bottom line it's well worth a rent and even a buy."
B00669UD0Q There have been some number of adventure thrillers where mountain climbing is at the heart. For my dollar this is well worth seeing.Here's the scoop. Five friends start out to climb a mountain. By pure chance they come across a young girl held in a makeshift underground vault. They realize she's been kidnapped for ransom and proceed to free her and make their way off the mountain, only to find her kidnappers are on their tail. Who will prevail in this game of cat and mouse?Given the mediocre reviews I almost didn't hit the play button on this. I was glad I did. It's better than I anticipated. It's directed and shot well. Great respect is shown for the mountains and landscapes. It gives the viewer a good sense of nature without looking like a travelogue. The pursuit is generally pretty good. There were a couple of cheap shots in the script. Face it. Playing the gun jamb card at a crucial part of the proceedings just doesn't cut it any more. But a lot of nifty things do happen elsewhere. Making the kidnapped girl an Eastern European, with the subsequent communication barrier causing more problems, was a nice touch. Things DID get a bit muddy for me when the guys with the ransom money enter the fray. I had a difficult time hearing what they were saying so I think I missed out on some important stuff.The acting by the climbers, particularly Melissa George, was pretty good. The bad guys didn't do much more than shoot their guns so it's hard to gauge their acting skills.This isn't quite worth the 4 stars I gave it but it's certainly better than 3. If you like action/adventure flicks you could do much worse."
B00669UD0Q Tossing bits of formula storyline into a box and shaking it does not produce anything but jumbled stuff. Just a few examples follow even though the entire movie is poorly edited, directed and the acting came across as actors just acting the roles and not understanding the roles. This potpourri strains credulity which for this type of movie you have to have.(1.) Pointless most of the first half hour showcasing partying at a climbing lodge. Helicopter scenic shots of hills, birds and the usual vehicle on a road. Overbearing drum and piano pounding sound effects to create tension when the acting and story is flat.(2.) Lots of scenes of Scottish Highlands at camera angles that made hills look like mountains; streams look like white water rapids. Pointless time spent on a very small town pagan honorific festival with fireworks made to look like New York City July 4th, all through different angles of the same firework. Lots of scenes of climbing equipment being assembled with multiple camera angles; turning a 30' drop into one that looked much further.(3.) People seem to repeatedly always show up at the same location despite the remote isolation. The first was our climbing group coincidentally finding a girl buried underground in a forest with only a small breathing pipe. The second that two hunters happen to be in the same spot. Then two more just walk up at the same remote spot and kill those hunters. then these two always seem to show up at the same location as our climbing party which has now split into two groups going in different directions yet all three groups seem to show up at the same location. Clever editing, in this case, made instanteous space travel possible.(4.) Buried girl is a kidnapped Serb Croatian - of course, since that's a currently popular ethnic plot point in movies. How the girl looks clean and fresh after being buried for days and the 3 inches of forest ground cover above her box looks undisturbed is quite a burying trick. She could have just pushed the lid up.(5.) Same girl is swept downstream and ends up underwater for ten minutes yet is revived by just breathing into her lungs. Hello, she should be dead and besides her lungs should have had water in them which needed to be cleared out first. When she revives it's as if she's waking from a nap.(6.) Climber falls down a hill and severely breaks an arm but later he using it just fine, then he says it was his leg that's broken so then he starts limping even though he was running previously when it was suppose to be his arm.(7.) Female climber is upstairs in an apartment that's engulfed in flames. She passes out, but in the next scene firemen are carrying her away. Such fast firemen (more editing) yet when the gunmen (who again seem to always know where to be) are going through the town shooting anyone they don't like, the police are no where to be seen.The ending reflected the movie in that it made little sense and went nowhere. Seemed like an afterthought finish. Great, and even good, movies pay attention to details and not just assume the audience is a bunch of not-paying attention toadstools."
B00669UD0Q By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MSThe Gilbey brothers, Julian and Will, almost didn't get to see their vision of A Lonely Place To Die, come to fruition. During one of the numerous climbing sequences a boulder came crashing down, almost hitting the production team.The film which was filmed in the Scottish highlands focuses on five mountaineers, who get caught up in fight-to survive the elements and ruthless killers.The climbers rest at the top of the ridge when Alison (Melissa George) tells the rest of the gang to be quiet, that she hears something.Soon the group discover a vent pipe coming out from under the ground with a weak voice coming from beneath. They dig, uncovering a chamber with a young Serbian girl inside. She can't speak English and they can't speak Serbian but they slowly become aware that she has been hidden away as part of a kidnapping plot.Miles from civilization the hikers must decide what to do. Knowing the danger, some want to abandon the girl saying \"at least she's free from her containment.\" But conscience prevails and they concur they must become reluctant heroes. The girl has no experience climbing. The terrain is unforgiving so they split up with two going for help, while the other follow a longer but safer path to the nearest community.The kidnappers return, armed to the teeth and start the deadliest of hunts.This is a terrifying cat and mouse where the obstacles are steep, the prey unarmed and the odds astronomical.This is a sleeper, must-see thriller."
B00669UD0Q Good, solid, tough, very brutal and action packed thriller about a deadly encounter in Scottish Highlands...This is a very good albeit VERY brutal British thriller, with good actors and a strong scenario, all of which is placed amongst breathtakingly beautiful landscapes.Of all the actors, before watching this film I knew only Melissa George (i saw her in &#34;Triangle&#34;), but everybody plays well. My favourite characters were Jenny (Kate Magowan), the older of the two women, who left her daughter with grandparents to relax a couple of days in the mountains in company of her significantly older husband and then Ed (Ed Speelers), frequently wise-cracking and occasionally annoying slacker, who once had a Croatian girlfriend who used to scream at him a lot in Serbo-Croatian...)))About the scenario, without revealing anything else than what is said on the back cover of the DVD, I will just say that it begins with five friends, three men and two girls, hiking in the wilderness of Scottish Highlands. They are all good people and the introduction, even if it is short, manages pretty well to establish a connection between the viewers and the five heroes. The place they have chosen to hike is so remote, that there is no cell phones service or Internet available and even the GPS plays tricks...Then suddenly the five heroes discover someting in the middle of the forest... And once they discovered it, the film really begins, because now some other people simply CAN NOT let them leave the wilderness alive...I am absolutely not saying anything about what will happen next, but believe me, if you like action packed thrillers you REALLY want to see this film. The scenario is really solid and the tension is maintained to the end. The villains are extremely bad people, but unlike in so many American films they can also speak - and what they have to say is as interesting as it is shocking...The finale of this film is particularly good - and shocking. Frankly, at the very end I felt a very cold shiver on my back... The conclusion of the film could be that if you really want to steal a dragon's egg, you should first be CERTAIN that you can outfight, outrun or outsmart the wyrm... Because woe to you if you can not...Music is rather discreet but in the moments it appears, it is very skilfully chosen to fit the landscapes or the action. In the beginning and expecially in the end we can hear absolutely splendid traditional Scottish songs, one of them dating from Jacobite wars. I liked them greatlyA very important warining here - this film is extremely BRUTAL and minors should not watch it in any circumstances.Bottom line, this is a good, solid and very BRUTAL action thriller and I am very pleased that I watched it. Enjoy!"
B00669UD0Q A LONELY PLACE TO DIE is an intense action thriller buoyed by breathtaking climbing sequences and quick-paced action sequences.  Set in the gorgeous Scottish Highlands, the film follows five mature adults on a climbing vacation who stumble upon a little girl buried underground, obviously a victim of kidnapping.  Their decision to rescue the child propels them into a cat and mouse confrontation with the deadly and relentless kidnappers.What elevates this sharp indie is the characters are believable and empathic, even if we don't get a lot of background we do care about them and want them to come out on top.  Director Julian Gilbey expertly keeps the tension intact and elicits strong performances from his talented cast.Melissa George (TRIANGLE, BAG OF BONES) gives an outstanding committed performance as the feisty but sensitive Allison.  Ed Speelis is good as the roguish Ed who experiences a sudden and required maturity.  Sean Harris oozes chilli9ng venom as evil Mr. Kidd and Karel Roden quietly compelling as Darko, the negotiator.  Eammon Walker and Alec Newman round out the cast.  Holly Boyd is effective as the kidnapped child.A LONELY PLACE TO DIE is dark and an ultimate downer.  Its also an expertly filmed thriller worthy of more attention."
B00669UD0Q A Lonely Place to Die is a movie best seen knowing as little as possible about it so, if you've avoided learning about the plot so far, just watch the movie. It plays with expectations and conventions to appear to morph from genre to genre while actually staying true to its own story. It's an adventure tale that moves along briskly without dawdling where it shouldn't and without rushing, either. The few very, very slight missteps are only apparent in contrast to the assuredness of the rest of the film and they pass, quickly to be forgotten. The Scottish Highlands setting verges on beautiful familiarity but reveals strangely beautiful alienness as the film progresses. The action and stuntwork in the film remains at a human level and is all the more effective for it."
B00669UD0Q If you are looking for a movie to add to your movie night, try this one you will love it. I watch this on Netflix, thinking it may have been poor entertainment, I was wrong. Its  starts of with 5 hiker's in the mountains; when they hear the cry of what seem to be a young girl crying for help. Then everything spirals down hill from there, I won't spoil the movie you won't be disappointed. Although, I felt the ending could have been better ,but still a great movie."
B00669UD0Q It focuses on a group of people who hike into the mountains and find a young girl buried under the ground... alive... they dig her out and try to get her to safety... TRY is the key word... someone is hunting them."
B00669UD0Q This was a good popcorn thriller. Nothing more.The acting was good, story line had some holes but what film that we love doesn't?I can confidently recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good adventure film but isn't looking too closely at the cosmetics.Should give it 4 stars but, meh, it will find its viewership.Worth it if you can find it under $10."
B00669UD0Q \"She's our responsibility now. We've got to get her off this mounting as soon as possible.\" When a group of mountain climbers out for a weekend of fun hear a sound in the forest they begin to investigate. When they find a little girl held prisoner in a small chamber they decide to rescue her. While trying to get her to freedom the hunters decide that a group is more fun to hunt then one little girl. This is a very frustrating movie to watch. The beginning was very tense and has you interested almost immediately. You feel like you can't catch your breath the entire time and are really rooting for the crew. Then with about a half hour left the movies stumbles badly and turns into something completely different and is barely able to hold your attention until the end. If I judged the movie based off the first hour I would definitely say watch this. Based off the ending I would say watch it still, but shut it off with a half hour left and have someone tell you the ending. Very disappointing. Overall, a very good movie for most of it. I give it a B- (would have been higher if ending was better.)"
B00669UD0Q Five mountaineers in the Scottish Highlands inadvertently get involved in a crime when they rescue a kidnapped Serbian girl in the woods. Following the tradition of thriller genre that is best represented by John Boorman classic \"Deliverance,\" Julian Gilbey's movie \"A Lonely Place to Die\" starts out promisingly, but rapidly descends into a series of nonsense.I can generally ignore plot holes as long as a film is good enough to entertain us. Unfortunately, \"A Lonely Place to Die\" is not good in most aspects. Action is mostly derivative with cardboard characters that cannot make a sensible decision even when \"villains\" are not around. Melissa George plays Alison, a seasoned mountain climber who should have known that climbing down a cliff is not a very good idea when some criminals responsible for the girl's imprisonment might be back in any minute.The film ditches its original idea of the cat-and-mouse thriller in the Scottish mountains in its third act, where things get even more ridiculous and confusing. Without spoiling much, all I can say is that a third party arrives in the climax that is padded out with drawn-out dialogues and unexciting action sequences involving guns.Obviously there is the potential for an intense thriller, which seems buried somewhere in \"A Lonely Place to Die.\""
B00669UD0Q The idea of taking someone and hiding them away until the ransom is collected is not new, and that is the main story here.  What is new, though, is the fact that they are hidden underground in a remote area in the mountains and found by mountain climbers/hikers.It does get very gory at times but you have to expect that from the contract killers/goons who took the young girl to begin with."
B0066SB8UQ You really can't go wrong with the Green Lantern Corps at all. Like to see this animated series do well and continue to evolve."
B0066SB8UQ keep the story  going  the rumor is your going to end the show after this season. that would be less than smart"
B0066SB8UQ If you have even a passing interest in the DC Universe or Green Lantern. You really must watch this show. From the beginning. You'll be so hooked. AND, you'll love it. On par or a bit better than Avenger's the Earth's Mightiest Heroes. Even better than the new Green Arrow adult show Arrow. Basically uses Geoff Johns inventive creations and condenses the story from the comic book series."
B0066SB8UQ This has to be the best animated adventure out there. It has a story plot that goes on and weaves it way through the story line. it has drama, adventure, action,heart and a love story of sorts as well without getting sappy and did i mention a actual story line ! Not just thrown together it is great. by the series it will be a great addition to your library"
B0066SB8UQ I checked out the pilot when I saw Sam Liu and Bruce Timm were involved, was immediately hooked and got an amazon video pass for the whole season.  At first I was skeptical of the 3D animation medium, especially since it's been done so badly before with superheroes (iron man, spiderman), but the simplified palette and detail characterized by Timm's style translated perfectly into the 3D medium.  What sealed the deal was they that they didn't skimp on details, such as the perfect syncing of the facial expressions and mouth movement to the dialog, the models being complex enough to give very human like expressions.  Clearly some pixar-level talent was involved in this series.  The art and style of this series is sublime, worthy to stand among the other feature-length animated superhero films from Sam Liu in the last half-decade.Aside from surface details, the voice acting is top-notch and the stories are amazingly well done.  The antimonitor arc was engaging and enjoyable.  It brought back some decades old memories of these green lantern stories and honors them with this modern re-imaginination."
B0066SB8UQ Ragnar, brother of Queen Iolande of Betrassus, has received a red ring as a result of his fury and jealousy at his sister's being chosen as a Green Lantern. Now the crew of the Interceptor must return to Betrassus and stop him. Meanwhile, all is not well among the on Oa. Apa, leader of the Guardians of the Universe, is determined to take down Ganthet (voiced by the late Ian Abercrombie, to whom the episode is dedicated) for embracing a \"base emotion\". Determined to help Hal Jordan and his friends, Ganthet reveals that he placed a \"protoype\" on the Interceptor before its departure based on the interaction between willpower and that \"base emotion\"...hope.The mythology of the Green Lantern comics is at its strongest in this episode, as is the quality of the show as a whole. New plot threads are added to the ever-expanding storyline of the series. The stage is set for yet another Lantern Corps to enter the mix. And the war with the Red Lanterns grows even more serious and deadly. It would appear that this season is building towards quite an exciting climax."
B0066SB8UQ I hope they make a second season.  My favorite character was not the main character, but the red lantern.  He was cooler."
B0066SB8UQ Really good series it's like a cartoon version of the movie but deeper the animation is also done well with good scripts and voices it give you a closer look on how green lantern is and the enemies he comes in contact with."
B0066SB8UQ This a good, family friendly show for all ages.  I especially like how this TV series brings together all aspects of the Green Lantern series."
B0066SB8UQ Forget what you saw in the Green Lantern movie!  This cartoon is true to it's comic book origins.  The CGI is perfect for this intergalactic cartoon.  The Green Lantern Corps is perfectly portrayed in this animation breakthrough. Think Incredibles style animation and quality on a weekly basis. That's how good this cartoon is!  This one is worth the price of admission.  If you like the comic book genre and a well written and acted cartoon, this one is a keeper!  Attention is paid to the character development and villains that are worthy adversaries to the hero.  This one doesn't try to dumb down the characters for a young audience. Adults and kids will watch this again and again!"
B0066SB8UQ I love being able to share some of my comic book heroes with my son who is 9 years old. Of course he thinks I should give it a 5 star review."
B0068ZCCA2 as always - great twists & turns and great challanges - never gets old to watch people being so sneaky."
B0068ZCCA2 My husband and I just started watching this show because it was on Prime.  We are hooked to the whole series!!  Best long running reality tv!"
B0068ZCCA2 I've seen several seasons of survivor.  This season was the most unsuspecting, full of surprise episodes.  Fabio's win was a perfect play using the &#34;below the radar&#34; technique.  The characters played well.  Some over played, and some simply quit playing.  Age did not matter.  All in all, Fabio's last 3 immunity wins played a factor in winning the game."
B0068ZCCA2 If you like watching people succeed at their lowest common denominator this season is for you.  There veiled bigotry, thievery, childish behavior, and selfishness.  The hungrier the contestants got the meaner they got with each other.  The black girl was an embarrassment to her race.  The old guy did nothing to assist his team in getting any rewards but he felt that he should have gone to the final three.  The nice guy would have finished last in a real life survivor situation but this case he didn't finish at all."
B0068ZCCA2 I would really like to see much earlier survivor shows, starting with the first season since I never got to watch those."
B0068ZCCA2 I am glad I didn't have to wait from week to week to find out what would happen next. Very enjoyable to watch from the comforts of my home."
B0068ZCCA2 I really love the Survivor series. I like how they switched up the tribes; older and younger. It's kind of unfair to separate young vs. old but Survivor isn't about being fair and it was entertaining to watch."
B0068ZCCA2 This is the first season of survivor my GF and I have ever watched, so we actually wanted to give the show five enthusiastic stars because survivor rocks. Now that we have seen some of the other classic, more widely beloved seasons we think that three stars is a better review of Nicaragua. I don't want to give away spoilers but some of the contestants don't seem like they really want to be there, the strategy is pretty pathetic for survivor standards, and the weather is rainy for pretty much the whole season which doesn't bother me on my couch too much but it was pretty draining for the contestants."
B0068ZCCA2 Watching Boston Rob play Survivor is amazing!  A lot of crazy characters on this season makes it so much fun to watch!"
B0068ZCCA2 Always enjoy watching survivor. Jeff has kept the adventures intriguing. Recommend all seasons that are currently available. Watch and enjoy."
B0068ZCCA2 This is a fun show to watch with young teen agers. We enjoyed it and watched some of the episodes together."
B0068ZCCA2 I will always give survivor 5 stars! I am a fan since the very first season like a lot of people! Some seasons are better than others but I have never found a season I didn't like!"
B0068ZCCA2 Watchable, adequately entertaining, recycled challenges.  Players were not especially appealing and I never developed even a remote favorite.  Several players were so annoying that I wished I could have voted them off myself.  The three finalists?  Ho-hum.  Cinematography was well done and Jeff was more animate than usual."
B0068ZCCA2 BEST REAL TV SERIES YET."
B0068ZCCA2 I didn't get a chance to watch this series when it was on network tv.  But I have enjoyed watching it on Amazon especially since there aren't any commercials."
B0068ZCCA2 I haven't watched Survivor much because it seems to bring out the worst in people.  Did make an exception and watched this season to see if anything had changed and was glad to see that the most deserving person won.  Congrats to all the survivors and well played."
B006DUK1K0 I watched this not knowing what to expect.  I found it entertaining and telling a story of life in a french brothel at the turn of the century.  It turned out better than I expected when I first started watching it."
B006DUK1K0 I accidentally started this when scanning through so I can't rate it. Sometimes the movie starts when I'm trying to slide through the selections."
B006DUK1K0 I have not watched this performance I it's entirety.  Interesting watching movie with sub titles.  Intend on seeing whole movie."
B006DUK1K0 ... it is not totally surprising that life in a brothel at the turn of the century was no bed of roses (or in any brothel today except maybe the Nevada houses which seem to always have a camera trained on the smiling whores), but the depiction of a lady's first encounter with sadism is shocking, and the mood pervades the rest of the flick. The symbolic &#34;emerald&#34; is confusing."
B006DUK1K0 This movie makes absolutely no sense.  It's about a bunch of 19th century hookers.  Thought it might be an interesting topic and go into other aspects of history--but no.  It's just about the hookers.  Don't waste your time."
B006DUK1K0 Very slow moving plot if there is one.  Trying to tell to many stories and really not showing anything really grabs you."
B006DUK1K0 Didn't hold my interest and turned off the film after the first five minutes.  That's my impression and not a slam on this film without viewing it longer."
B006DUK1K0 This movie was so odd and yet I couldn't stop watching it. If you're wondering if you'd like it just know that this film (IMO) was a cross of a History Channel docu-drama, late night poorly made soft core porn and Moulin Rouge (&lt;because of the interior design and cinematography). Here are my top 10 noteworthy observations from the movie:1. As you can probably figure out by the title, this film focuses firstly on the market and exploitation of women in France come the 1900s2. ^However, the director/ writer were both clever in really drawing your attention to the different women when they were all together and everything seemed harmless, and natural and beatiful in the state of undress. Pretty much any other time you see these women (90% topless, 10% fully nude) and with a man, (maybe just me, maybe for others), but I didn't find them appealing anymore. It's as though they morphed into puppeteered china dolls that felt so lifeless yet had such entertained facade around their \"guests\". (And yes, I understand anyone might put on a facade if you were being sold for sex every night).3. You are constantly reminded in this movie that despite the care-free somewhat lux lives these women are living, they are by no means free. Every day they rack up a debt that they will never be able to re-pay4. It is strange at times as you get mixed feelings from some of the women about sex/ relationships- some speak of their 'clients' in a rather light and humorous manner, some seem like they pride themselves in their \"specialties\", while others have grown to despise sex altogether.5. The interior design and lay out of the bordello is quite beautiful (although I'd hate to see it under a black light lol)6. For how much time is spent around the characters the ending is quite disappointing but neat that they filmed this \"bordello\" in present day with it's surroundings.7. The modern music was at times an odd touch, especially when many of the characters are slow dancing in period attire to the Moody Blues, although this has been accomplished in other movies seamlessly, here it achieved quite the opposite effect.8. Very interesting undertone with the main character, as you follow her from the beginning as just another ordinary prostitute through her horrible accident, her odd dream sequence and later the revival of someone/ something else in her.9. It was very interesting to watch their use and methods of sanitation, even though many ended up getting sick or dying anyway.10. Also noteworthy is the appaling goodbye letter written to one of the women stating that since coming from an aristocratic and healthy family and despite his deep love and unquestionable willingness to sacrifice himself for her, he must not see her anymore as she has an infectious terminal illness...really?? You're more concerned about catching an STD and spreading it to your high nose aristocrat family than the fact that you have no morals or self-respect to 1. tarnish your character by going to the local whore house and 2. be a coward and liar who obviously doesn't know what deep love or self-sacrifice isOverall, it was to say the least an interesting movie, that still managed to keep my interest despite it's slow moving plot and english subtitles. I would probably only recommend this to students with interests or classes in human rights, women's rights, exploration of human sexuality, or psychology, as this movie could make for great discussions and personal interpritations."
B006DUK1K0 A really boring soft-core porn film rather than a French art film.  As best I can tell there was no plot.  if you're looking for a god foreign film pass this one up!!"
B006DUK1K0 This movie was so much more than expected.  I thought it was a beautifully done movie on all counts. I thought the timing appropriate to the film and the unfolding of the story. If I was looking more for entertainment than thought provoking material this wouldn't have been my choice. The nudity was entirely used as costume, not excitement or for shock value.  It addressed the vulnerability of being female while focusing on a more specific slice of that vulnerability that is only different because of the specific exchange of coins. The era, the settings, the players make no difference in the experience or our social structure as it relates to women. The sheer sensitivity of all the people who put this together is amazing. It took great understanding to pull this off in this delicate way.  All that being said the title was completely unfortunate.  I would never have selected this movie and someone looking &#34;for a good time&#34;, will be disappointed.  The reviews should help but many go by a title.  It does not attract it's target audience. I will think about this movie while others will be frustrated. That will be what is reflected in comments."
B006DUK1K0 The movie was okay but it dragged in places.  The ending was a little disappointing and left the viewer hanging."
B006DUK1K0 It is best movie in long time.  I loves the history and always learn something that I haven't hear or learn in the past."
B006DUK6SM \"It's takes a village to raise a child.\"  Everyone could have made a difference before it was too late if they had chosen to do so.Movies Message:  We all have choices everyday in our own \"villages\"."
B006DUK6SM This movie surpassed my expectations for it!  Maudlin and stirring with deep regret and a heartfelt sadness that is not easily expressed.  Piven is a very good actor for a young talent.  Having sons, sons who drifted away through traumatic separations make it difficult to watch.  Losing someone is a living death though they are alive; still it is like a death when they are out of a person's life.  Divorce has made a Nation full of dislocated parents and children.  Asking why a thousand times a day doesn't make it any better or different!"
B006DUK6SM What happens when you leave a child unattended for a few minutes, only to find out that the child has ventured out of the truck, in the cold winter, and is found too late. With this premise, the movie is about the parents, both a little screwed up, and certainly not parents of the year. The father, who is responsible for the event, never quite makes it through, and one can tell ahead of time where this story is heading. Sad, a great reminder that children must be under supervision at all times, and more depressing than anything else. 3 Stars."
B006DUK6SM A very good story line. A young dad takes his son in his truck into the woods,in the dead of winter, sees something, locks his son in the truck, cautioning him not to move and goes to explore.  he comes back and his son is not in the truck and not a trace of him.The rest of the plot keeps you in two minds and the endings is quite a shock."
B006DUK6SM ANGELS CREST is not a perfect movie: there are so many undeveloped sidebars that keeping everyone in a place where they seem to fit into the tale is difficult.  But there are some powerful performances here and some cause for reflection that makes the movie very worthwhile watching. Based on the novel by the same name written by Leslie Schwartz, adapted for the screen by Catherine Trieschmann, and directed by Gaby Dellal, the story deals with numerous interactions of a small town populated with alcoholics, drug abusers, adulterers, and other strange types and how they deal with a tragedy that makes no sense.Nate Denton (Ameko Eks Mass Carroll) is a 3 year old son of Ethan Denton (Thomas Dekkar in a breakout performance that deserves attention) who awakens one morning in his pathetic home to tell his beloved single dad that it is snowing.  The father/son bond is strong and Ethan dresses them both to go out to view the beauty of the snowy countryside in their old truck.  When they arrive at a perfect spot, Ethan turns to the backseat to take Nate out to make snowmen, but Nate has fallen asleep in this safety car seat.  Ethan makes the truck warm, locks the truck and walks out to view the spectacle of winter, the deer, and the eloquent mountains.  In a few minutes he returns - and Nate is gone!  Ethan is terrified, begins shouting his son's name as he searches for him.  The town is alerted and a search party begins.  Nate's mother alcoholic mother Cindy (Lynn Collins) is notified of Nate's missing and begins her tirade on every person she meets.  After an overnight search for Nate, Ethan discovers Nate's frozen body and is devastated. Ethan is taken into custody for a death stemming from negligence and the townspeople form sides as to Ethan's guilt.  Among them is a waitress Angie (Mira Sorvino) and her small daughter Rosie (Emma Macgillivray), Ethan's friend Rusty (Joseph Morgan), a lesbian couple (Elizabeth McGovern and Kate Walsh), Cindy's preachy  mother (Barbara Williams). and the local police.  The town brings in the District Attorney (Jeremy Piven) who obviously has secrets of his won that mirror Ethan's crisis.  The story is resolved in a strange and tragic manner, leaving many crises unsolved.Thomas Dekkar gives such a fine performance that we are able to see inside his heart and head and soul.  The supporting cast conveys the small town response to a tragedy among their own - who is guilty of what and how could the incident have ever occurred.  There are many ideas created by the writers and the characters that are never realized fully, but the sense of human response to an accident is staggeringly real.  There is much more to this film in retrospect, after watching it, that haunts the viewer.  Grady Harp, December 11"
B006DUK6SM The plot is interesting, the characters are believable, technically great. I would like to see more of this program, and hope it makes the cut."
B006DUK6SM Ordinarily in a movie filled with grief, such as this one, there is some teaching moment - something that saves it from the pit of despair.  Now I realize that isn't life.  Life hands us grief - or, more times than not, we make our own.  I does not hand us an 'Ah Ha!' moment.  Many times movies try to do that - it doesn't here.  It leaves every individual to find their own reason based on the surface look of a mix of characters.  In other words - it's filmed grief of flawed individuals that unfortunately produced a child.  They are so absorbed by their own flaws that they really fail this child from the moment of conception.  Maybe that's the teaching moment.  It doesn't matter how much you love something or someone; if you don't pay real attention to anyone besides yourself - you will eventually call it guilt."
B006DUK6SM Heartbreakingly realistic performances by most of the actors along with an excellent script makes &#34;Angels Crest&#34; a must see drama.  It portrays the consequences of bad decisions in as brutal a fashion as I have ever seen in a movie.  The lead actor was outstanding if somewhat enigmatic. His heartbreak is as true to reality as I have seen any actor portray."
B006DUK6SM and scary reminder of how quickly little people become curiously efficient! well directed/acted relationships that, like real life, are dependent on the domestic occurrences...and the invisible command to mature or deal with consequences."
B006DUK6SM Just what we need.  Another deeply depressing downer about dealing with the death of a child.  This time we have Ethan (Thomas Dekker from TV's \"Terminator: The Sarah Conner Chronicles\"), a 20 something dad who has custody of his 3 year old son.  He is divorced from his alcoholic, skanky sleep-around wife (Lynn Collins).  The film is set in the fictitious Angels Crest, Montana (filmed in the Alberta Rockies), occupied by a small but close community of gorgeous people, at least all that are under 50.The town has a diner where everyone gathers and exchange gossip about each other.  The diner is run by Angie (Mira Sorvino), the sympathetic big sister type.  We know we are in for rough sledding early on when Ethan takes his 3 year old out into the wilderness to build a snowman.  The poor kid falls asleep and dad decides to leave him in the truck and track down some deer.  I mean, there is all kind of wildlife in this mountainous region, but you would think this guy had never seen a deer.  When Ethan returns to the truck 10 or 15 minutes later, the kid is gone.  Somehow he had managed to escape his car seat, roll down the window and escape.Well, there is no happy ending and it is hard to not feel for the poor schmuck as you would anyone.  No one in town feels anything but sympathy including the town lesbians played by Elizabeth McGovern as the former straight, married with-a-son one and Kate Walsh in all her butchiness.  Then there's Cindy's (Collins) mother the Evangelical and Jeremy Piven as the D.A. who is going to prosecute Ethan.  Jack (Piven) it seems has a past of his own.  Something about losing his only child, but we never learn the particulars.  Then there's the best friend of Ethan who has also been sleeping with Cindy.  Whew!  There's more but you get the idea.In a tragedy play like this, the director got too involved with the numerous characters.  In addition, some of the scenes are just ridiculous.  In one, Jack the prosecutor (Piven) shows up at a potential witness's house wearing one of those furry hats with the earflaps that tie...and it never comes off.  In another, Ethan decides to take Angie's three year old daughter for a ride in his truck without telling her.  This is after his son dies!  Are you kidding me?  Anyway, forget this film unless you want to go into a manipulated deep state of depression, albeit with some beautiful snowy Rocky Mountain vistas.  A much better, but similar themed movie of this nature is Atom Egoyan's \"The Sweet Hereafter\" (1997)."
B006DUK6SM I rented this because Mira Sorvino was in it and the last two movies we've watched with her in it were so well-acted that now I check out any new movies that she's in.  She had a small role in this movie, but she was good in the role.What I liked about this movie was how real it felt, the acting was so good that you could actually believe they were father and son and you get lost in it that way.  The little boy steals your heart. What I didn't like was how underdeveloped the other characters were, how several side stories were introduced but went nowhere and the extremely abrupt ending.I don't regret renting it and I thought it was pretty good, but also frustrating in that it felt incomplete."
B006DUK6SM My wife and I found this movie to be quite boring.  The acting was OK, but the author left something to be desired."
B006DUK6SM None of the movie was a surprise but a simple depiction of tragedy. The film simply set up the scene, the basics of character, a tragic event to propel the movie There were tons of subplots hinted at and it could easily have gone off course, but it didn't.  I thought it was interesting that the film maker made the choice to remind us that everyone has their own baggage in any situation, but that doesn't  change the main focus. It really made me think about how quickly the most innocent choice could go wrong so quickly.  A bad choice could  turn even quicker and children are so quick after they learn to walk!  the town sentiments were complex and mixed in with their own personal issues, but it seemed to be a divide between those that had children and those that didn't, but there is plenty of room for differing opinions. Lovely seamless acting by everyone."
B006FKSSOY While I may find the care bears just a tad annoying my daughter loves this show. What am I to do?"
B006FKSSOY He's almost 3 years old and he loves the voices and colors in the Care Bears.  I'm not so sure he follows all the stories, but he has a great time laughing and watching it."
B006FKSSOY It's Care Bears! My kids love them and it has several episodes so your not sorting through Dvd's looking for other episodes"
B006FKSSOY This is a great show for babysitting. It keeps the young children entertained while teaching values. I recommend it to everyone."
B006FKSSOY Care Bears is a very colorful show that has a lesson for the kids to learn. My grandson really likes for me to play them on my kindle for him."
B006FKSSOY My daughter loves the care bears and these cartoons are very cute.  Nothing scarey him them and the animation is way better than the ones I grew up with."
B006FKSSOY Care bears are always uplifting, never any foul language and it shows my little ones ways to make choices.  I also like the use of color to enhance each character."
B006FKSSOY This is not the care a lot I grew up with but they are still very cute and the message is always positive. This is a great show to let your kids watch."
B006FKSSOY My 3 yo adores this updated classic. Theme song is required singing :). A classic that still teaches valuable lessons. Great pic too"
B006FKSSOY The show is great.  But my granddaughter ordered this automatically without my permission.  I have since learned how to block ordering.  All she had to do was press watch this now - and I payed  She just pressed buttons and watched these shows all day long.  The shows kept her occupied and she wantedmore and more"
B006FTBWXY Nice to watch Family and also you learn from it. A four some language not appropriate.. improve for kids to watch they are our future..."
B006FTBWXY The show is still pretty cool. Like learning about all the stuff that comes into the shop. Clean for the family."
B006FTBWXY Great show, the old man and Chumley are hillarious. I like the crew and I have learned a lot about what to look for at yard sales and thrift stores."
B006FTBWXY Unlike the ever predictable theme of every Rocky movie that came out these guys are doing the same thing all the time but have fresh stuff to show you at each show."
B006FTBWXY Love this show. I enjoy all the history you learn about a object and not to mention how much some stuff goes for."
B006FTBWXY I love this show.  Not only do you learn amazing history of the objects that come in, but the enthusiasm of Rick for his purchases is fun to see.  And the interaction between family members and staff can be hilarious. To be able to watch this show on my new ipad is absolutely wonderful."
B006FTBWXY I always learn a lot about things that people bring in to sell.  There is a lot of history behind some of the items.  Always fun to watch."
B006FTBWXY It is fun to see all of the different,and interesting, things that come into the store. It must be a very large business operation as most pawn shops that i have visited were filled with a variety of pretty common stuff.Pops, the boys, and  Chumley are the real fun entertainment of the show."
B006FTBWXY I love the historical aspects of this show.  It is outrageously fun.  All of the personalities seem to work well together."
B006FTBWXY I have the HDX 8.9&#34; and really love this show.  Being a Prime member, I especially enjoy getting certain seasons for free.  Anyway, content wise the show is wonderful.  It's always entertaining because you never know what someone is bringing in.  Picturewise, the picture is excellent in HD.  This is just a great investment in your entertainment."
B006FTBWXY the store receives some pawns that are old, artistic, motorhead, canons, vintage guns and much ..much more..it's nice to see some comedic interactions with store workers also.."
B006FTBWXY Love the family and chumley too. Rick loves History and me as we ll. I hope to some day go in shop and buy something that I don t need, that somebody else didn t need and then pass it down to somebody that doesn t need it either"
B006FTBWXY I have been watching this show long enough to know that Chumlee is a good shot. He should compete in tournaments."
B006FTBWXY well: this is a 2 Disc set beginning with Darth Pawn & ending with Take a Seat which is from 2011 & NO NEW DVDS yet! Now they cut & edit their own programs to sneak in additional ads. But I digress. If you LOVE the guys, you WILL Luv the episodes but we are willing to get more dvds & everything stopped. There are other Pawns but they're basically Reissues or as they call them &#34;Fan Favorites&#34;. I've written A&E & HISTORY to no avail & no answers. Lousy marketing in our opinions. We can't afford the Instant Seasons that are available either."
B006FTBWXY If you follow this show you know that over the seasons they have started to focus on &#34;storylines&#34; about each member of the show (Rick, Cory, The Old Man and Chumley). I don't watch the show for this stupidity, I enjoy seeing the items that come in, learning about them and what they are worth.  I really wish they would focus on that more and less on these silly stories that no one cares about."
B006FTBWXY Love the Pawn Stars guys and this is another great season.  Hope to see season 6 and 7 next on Prime.  I like to learn about things and watch this guys, they always make me smile."
B006FTBWXY When this show originated, I never expected it to last.  As it progressed, I became hooked on trying to evaluate the various items brought in.As the show progressed, my opinion of the blue-collar, poor grammar guys in the shop really upsurged.  They really know their history and business.  From fine art to antique artifacts, these guys are truly knowledgeable way beyond the poor knowledge demonstrated of their native language.The show is compelling, kind of like a poor man's PBS Antique's Road Show."
B006FTBWXY We love this series.  Informative and funny. Love the interaction between the generations who work together. Chumlee is a hoot!"
B006FTBWXY Love this season as I do all of their seasons. Chum lee and the guys are as always great. Love the new shop"
B006FTBWXY My family and I love this show and the staff.  We mainly watch it because of the history we learn about the artifacts."
B006FTBWXY The show features a trio of men who seem to really enjoy how they make a living by buying and selling some very unusual items. Once in awhile someone will show up with a rare, almost priceless item that they want to sell. That's where the fun begins. Is it real or is it fake?  This keeps the interest high, making the show well worth watching."
B006FTBWXY In every episode you learn bits of history behind the items brought into the pawn shop, all while being entertained.  And who knows, maybe you have a valuable treasure sitting in the closet. :)"
B006FTBWXY Quick Take: Essentially, this is half a season for half the price. A non-sale, non-discounted price of 19.95 fits in line with almost six hours worth of DVD content. A full season, had it been released that way, would simply have doubled the asking price.Last year, History and A&E; Television made the dubious decision to start releasing Volumes of their most popular shows as opposed to Seasons. I was one of the most vocal opponents of this move and some of my scathing tirades can be found on those initial releases. In truth, though, I have nothing against the idea of volume releases (especially for shows that aren't held together by continuing plot threads) as long as three things are clear:1) They need to be priced according to content and no more expensive individually than a season set would be.2) Don't start releasing Full Seasons and then switch tactics mid-stream to confuse unsuspecting buyers.3) If it isn't a season, all content needs to be disclosed on the DVD packaging so the consumer knows what they are getting!Last year, many of these early Volume releases broke my second and third rule. I mean really! How can you release a DVD when it's not a full season and NOT tell buyers how many and which episodes are included? Absolutely unforgivable. I need that information to decide whether or not I want to purchase the set. As we have progressed, though, and the notion that we're to continue with Volume releasing has stayed with us, the point becomes rather more muddy. Now, we're past the second issue and the third issue has been corrected. All of these Volume releases now contain information about the content. So, there is no deception and no confusion. You get \"x\" number of episodes for \"x\" price. It's now up to you whether or not it's worth it. That's fair. If you don't like it, don't buy it.Volume Five of \"Pawn Stars\" contains sixteen episodes over two discs for just shy of six hours worth of content, coming from most of Season Four.  If you have collected the earlier entries in the Pawn Stars DVD releases, this is the next group of chronological episodes.  There are no Special features, but English and Spanish subtitles are optional. Included:(1) Darth Pawn, (2) Put Up Your Dukes, (3) Pawn Illustrated, (4) Striking A Chord, (5) Harrison For President, (6) Wise Guys, (7) Robosaurus, (8) Ah, Shoot!, (9) Going Postal, (10) Chummobile, (11) Evel Genius, (12) Pablo Pawncasso, (13) Sub For Sale, (14) Missile Attack, (15) Not On My Watch, and (16) Take A Seat.The show is entertaining for several reasons. Of course, some intriguing merchandise passes through their hands and you just might learn something. But as in any reality show, this one is as much about interaction and conversation as it is about the art of the deal. The Harrison guys are a colorful crew--real old school Vegas. Perhaps the biggest scene stealer is Chumlee (like an adopted son) who plays village idiot, but can surprise you as well. It's comical and engaging for the most part. All in all, it is rather like the unsavory and confrontational cousin to the classic \"Antiques Roadshow\" with more grit and edge. KGHarris, 8/12,"
B006FTBWXY Please read my review of Volume 6.Not too much has changed.I reviewed #6 before #5 so the review process is backwards.This is an unusual series.Much like &#34;Antique Road Show&#34;but in a pawn shop."
B006FTBWXY Every show has interesting things that come into the Pawn Shop.  However, I am extremely tired of the jousting, barbs and insults form the Old Man (especially), and that Rick never has a good job or good word for Cory or Chum.  I've stopped watching almost.  I don't watch nearly as much as I did in the past."
B006FTBWXY Here is a vidio set that is so neat to think history is still in the hands of folks that don't always know what they have.  Fun and a great way to discover things about history you may have never known."
B006FTBWXY I love the Pawn Stars series, particularly because we can't watch it on television so being able to rent it from Amazon is a plus. What's not to like with 4-5 fat guys showing off their knowledge of historic object (and some not so historic). Satisfies an inner need for greed."
B006FTBWXY chumlee is the star of the show. rick is the brains. their antic are almost as good as I love lucy. Plus you get and education as well."
B006FTBWXY The is a very fun show. You just can't watch one. Great entertainment plus you always learn something as well."
B006FTBWXY Big Hoss is stepping it up to try and assert his place as a co-owner of the Pawn Shop.  Very interesting dynamics in a great setting with lots of interesting characters and items coming thru the doors."
B006FTBWXY A lot of set-ups, but that's OK. Takes all kinds to make the world go around. Like to see it in person."
B006FTBWXY We love Pawn Stars and appreciate being able to stream it but...Amazon's responsiveness has been horrid!!! They must improve on the responsiveness of the equipment serving up these videos. I essentially gave up after viewing just one episode (which we loved).The problem isn't once the streaming starts, but it is getting the system to the point where an episode can be selected and then started. I'm using a Roku3 box."
B006FTBWXY Addictive show and a huge hit now. You really learn interesting tidbits about old merchandise and historic pieces. And with money involved, it keeps you watching. I will say the current seasons are coming up with more nonsense with the crew. Very pre-scripted stuff. Many items brought in lately are guns and books. I prefer movie props myself."
B006FTBWXY Love the people, history lessons and fun they have.  Three generation shows a deep love as well as real conflict. We often wonder who and where are the women in their life."
B006FTBWXY I enjoy this show very much.  It is interesting to watch the various items that come in for sale and the negotiations that take place between the seller and the pawn shop owners.  Some sellers over value their product while some under value their product and the pawn shop owners have to sort it out while trying to make a profit.  It is all very entertaining."
B006FTBWXY Very entertaining.  I think Chumlee is really cool.  The old man is hysterical.  They're all good.  Keep them coming. Voila!"
B006FTBWXY Very entertaining, and enlightenment of what articles are really worth. I'd recommend this program to anyone who has old memorabilia lying around to watch this program."
B006FTBWXY My whole family likes this show.  We love the different historical finds.  We like to know what an object is worth and what you can get monetarily from one.  The family chemistry is fun to watch.  We have recommended this show to our friends and family."
B006FTBWXY The people on &#34;reality&#34; tv are fake and they encourage our youth to laziness and an inability to use their intelligence for anything but staring dumbly at the television."
B006FTBWXY Viva Las Vegas! Where else would you find characters like this. Entertaining and educational with a bit of real life drama."
B006FTBWXY I really enjoy seeing trinkets and treasures coming out and the value put on them.  But I cannot stand the pompous attitude that pervades the show through the slob characters.  It's so bad that I just turn the program off midway.  I'll take American Pickers and the storage war people over the Pawn Stars any day any time."
B006FTBWXY I love pawn stars, so of course I like volume 5. If u like the earlier seasons then you'll like this one. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes reality tv."
B006FTBWXY We love watching this show. You learns something new about antiques and see what people have collected in their attics or cellars ~ that are worth some money! Makes you wish you'd kept some of those old items you tossed years ago :)"
B006FTBWXY Fun to see what kind of things make it into a Pawn Store. The items are interesting as well as the people that bring in the items.The family dynamics are also entertaining"
B006FTBWXY If this show would stop interrupting itself with SCRIPTED NONSENSE, it would be nearly perfect for what it is.  Interesting transactions and conversations of historical relevance with customers and experts are the highlights of this show.  Here we have people who are genuinely interesting WITHOUT SCRIPTED SCENES, participating in fake pranks and telling poorly-timed jokes.  It just stinks of audience manipulation and poor writing.  Neither of which belong in a &#34;REALITY&#34; TV show.I blame the show runners.  They need to be fired.  Let's just follow the &#34;Pawn Stars&#34; on their terms and hear from them and let reality HAPPEN instead of manipulating it.  I think these guys are interesting people.  Let THEM run the show.  Let THEM decide how to film.If the fake crap does not stop, I am not going to view this anymore--and I suggest you avoid it too.  Why participate in time-wasting TV tactics?  I tune in to observe experts and pawn professionals do their thing.  This is not supposed to be the next &#34;Three's Company.&#34;Otherwise, the show is great because Chumlee, The Old Man, Rick, and Corey are good, unique, and often funny people.  When not scripted, of course."
B006FYDKMA The best pickers in the Biz, been watching these guys since they started the show and love every episode.  Well produced with great audio and video quality."
B006FYDKMA THIS show is fun to watch for the entire family,teaches our our younger generations how things used to be,when the guys find old hidden treasures from the past..these &#34;pickers&#34; are not afraid to get their hands dirty,sometime s climbing through piles of storages things,to find a &#34;honey hole&#34;of special items from America's past.They travel America's back roads,again teaching us all what great country we live in."
B006FYDKMA Great way to pick up on some history and american culture.  This show will make you a better negotiator at yard sales."
B006FYDKMA This was a great episode, but I may be biased because I think all of their episodes are great. And as a collector myself I always learn something new from these guys."
B006FYDKMA After all these years this show still amuses me in what they do. Every time I watch it I actually learn something. Its still as good as it was when it first started."
B006FYDKMA I've watched seasons 1 - 4 so far and enjoyed them all.  Mike and Frank set up a friendly bantering when they are on the road.  It is fascinating to see the &#34;rusty gold&#34; that they find in some people's piles of junk."
B006FYDKMA How absolutely cool it is to see inside the daily lives and jobs of three very cool people !and the treasures they find are more often the people they meet than the stuff they collect."
B006FYDKMA Mike and Frank seem like guys I could hang out with, I enjoy the dynamic of the two of them driving around in the van and the interactions they have with the people they pick. I also love the stories that go along with the treasures that they find. It didn't hurt that I only paid $9.99 for the entire season, Mike, that's what we call &#34;breaking the ice&#34;."
B006FYDKMA I almost feel like I am picking with them or at one of their stores. I enjoy learning about the pickers and their customers. It is fun to be told what an item was originally used for."
B006FYDKMA Seems like a good series and the characters are interesting."
B006FYDKMA Its refreshing to see nice guys doing well in business -- treating others fairly, not trying to swindle, cheat, beat or climb over others as a way of doing business. They make it pleasurable for all! Very enjoyable show."
B006FYDKMA Many years spent riding with my dad doing just the same thing, meeting folks and picking!  Can't beat it.  You meet some crazy, funny and interesting people who widen your horizons and expand your knowledge and just plain have fun!  I can even almost guess the prices they will pay and what they will sell it for.  It is great to see them treat people fairly and just enjoy themselves.  Good fun!"
B006FYDKMA My wife and I can't get enough of this show.  Mike and Frank (and Dani) are entertaining, the stuff they find is amazing, and the information they supply on history of the objects is usually quite interesting"
B006FYDKMA This is a great consept for a show. I watch every episode i can. I like the way the guys treat everyone they meet."
B006FYDKMA Two childhood friends travel across America searching for the old and the unusual.  They take these items out of hiding and sell them in their store to other people who appreciate the history behind them.  Their enthusiasm for the history behind the items and their excitement in finding them is infectious."
B006FYDKMA I'm not a reality TV? Fan but I do enjoy this show, the guys are fun and funny. As is the gal in the store. A key part of the team. Finding and sending the guys to a good picking site. All in all, a fun entertaining and even educational, whenThey find an object, and can give us it's history,You won't be disappointed, if you watch this, show, and all the characters, they run into."
B006FYDKMA These two give a glimpse of how things were in the &#34;good old days.&#34; Mike and Frank are always on the lookout for things that bring back the past in rural America. They have lots of fun looking, and we have fun watching them look."
B006FYDKMA I think it's boring but the Mr. likes it.  Not much changes from episode to episode.  It must be a guy thing."
B006FYDKMA Explanation For Lower Rating:I'm not sure what the History Channel is doing with their DVD releases this year, but it is certainly a step in the wrong direction. When they released \"Pawn Stars: Volume Three,\" many people assumed that the show would be Season Three as the other two seasons of the program had been released in their entirety. It was, in fact, only sixteen episodes. When they released \"American Pickers: Volume Two,\" it was the same thing. Season One had been released with all episodes, but this Volume Two was only eight episodes of Season Two. I know some people that preordered sight unseen, or just weren't paying attention, felt a little shortchanged by these smaller portions as opposed to what they had assumed were full season DVD releases. Personally, I didn't agree with the decision but, at least, the DVD packaging was very clear about what was included. Anyone who read the box knew what to expect: how many episodes and which ones, so it wasn't a blind investment!Now here's a leap backwards for \"American Pickers,Volume 4.\"I am sitting here with the DVD in hand and nowhere does it say how many episodes are inside. Never mind that it doesn't list them (which in my opinion it should if it is not a Complete Season package), it doesn't even tell you how many episodes you are getting. I suppose I'm supposed to look at the running time and do some estimated mathematics? I know this may seem trivial to some or that I'm overreacting, but I think the company owes potential buyers this information. My lower rating, therefore, reflects the History Channel's (or A&E; Networks distributing) apparent disregard for its own fan base. I don't like to make purchases without knowing exactly what I'm paying for!  It's not the price (which is in line with the contents), it's the lack of information that bothers me.I, however, will tell you what is inside. The 2 DVD set has eight episodes, a chronological continuation of Season Two for just shy of six hours worth of programming.  Really, how hard would it have been to include the fact that there were eight episodes on the DVD box?Season Two: (1) Fairlane Fever, (2) Too Hot To Handle, (3) Trading Up, (4) The Emu Chase, (5) Keep Out!, (6) They Boldly Go, (7) The Possum Trot, and (8) California Dreamin.  There are no special features, but there are Spanish and English subtitle options.The premise, for anyone unfamiliar with the show, is that two \"pickers\" (Mike Wolfe and Frank Fritz) travel the country trying to unearth hidden treasures from the various people they meet along the way. Some of the items may have historical significance.  That's the angle the History Channel uses to tie the show into its lineup. In truth, the show has similar appeal to the classic \"Antique Roadshow\" mixed with the treasure hunting gamble of \"Storage Wars\" with a dash of \"Hoarders\" thrown in for good measure. It's always intriguing to see what long forgotten gems might be lurking in someone's garage or junkyard. Along the way, the boys chat up the locals and experience a different kind of Americana.  An interesting show, but fans deserve some respect in these DVD releases.  KGHarris, 8/12."
B006FYDKMA Mike and Frank have great personalities and in-depth knowledge of antique junk! It's a junk history lesson on things I have thrown away. It's easy to get hooked on these episodes."
B006FYDKMA My husband and I enjoy American Pickers. This show captures audiences both old and young. Very diverse and entertaining. Funny!"
B006FYDKMA Ride again!You just can't go wrong with these guys, (and gals...).  Okay, I take issue with some of his motorcycle &#34;expertise&#34;, (having ridden and worked on / for the Big Twin for most of my life), but it's STILL one of the original and best series of it's kind available today."
B006FYDKMA The chase is on to a reality show that is fun and amazing in the search of America's lost treasures.  You will love it and a must for trivia and seakers of the past ."
B006FYDKMA I love American Pickers I have watched almost every episode at least once some several times. Started watching it the first season and would record it on the DVR.  Since we have had Amazon Prime we have watched all of those shows and the newer ones too. Appreciate not having to lose them after a year or so.  They are fun to review."
B006FYDKMA Amazing show with both history and entertainment. The stuff they run into keeps you wondering what they will find next. Mike and Frank are great together and make the show flow."
B006FYDKMA I just get a kick out of watching these guy come up with treasures out of junk heaps.  They seem to have a knack for finding some real unusual characters along the way too.  I recommend this show to anyone."
B006FYDKMA Great show!! Looking forward to more episodes! Love what they find, they have given me idea's on how to re use old items."
B006FYDKMA Am always entertained at their ability to talk prices down, But am always educated as to history of antiques and the such. Love their chemistry and the occasional danielle pick."
B006FYDKMA GREAT SHOW!!! MY BROTHER TOLD ME ABOUT THIS SHOW& I LOVE IT.... SO WHEN I SAW IT OFFERED AMAZON &#34;PRIME&#34; (FREE) I SNAPED IT UP!!!!"
B006FYDKMA Yay...love these guys and the people that they find. Always a good time filler!"
B006FYDKMA Mike and Frank have the best jobs in the world! I wish I could do what they do. They inspire me to do some picking."
B006FYDKMA I learn so much from watching these guys. Great show. Never gets old. Always something different. Frank and Mike are great together."
B006FYDKMA History, stories and junk combined and delivered by two real characters. An educational, human interest tour-de-force. I can't wait for the next season to go Prime."
B006FYDKMA I really enjoy seeing the Pickers find some great stuff.  I bring back memorials and also gives you some history."
B006FYDKMA Awesome Show for anyone who likes old stuff. Funny and educational with engaging characters. Have seen stuff on this show I've never seen before!"
B006FYDKMA Never get tired of seeing what they will find next on their trail for the next great collectible.  Their searches for stuff is fun to watch...almost like an antique scavenger hunt!  As a collector myself with over 500 advertising signs and other collectibles, I can appreciate their enthusiasm for the &#34;hunt&#34; ... just don't come to my house looking for stuff!"
B006GM4JNU This might be the only Disney show that's actually worth watching.  It is very entertaining and has a nice range of characters."
B006GM4JNU &#34;Whatcha doing?&#34; Watching Phineas and Ferb, probably. :-) It's nice to have the episodes available on demand and not have to scour the TV listings to see when it is on. Each episode is great and there are many layers to explore for everyone, kids and adults."
B006GM4JNU My 6 year old son loves Phineas and Ferb and he is so excited to be able to watch them again as we haven't had cable in a while. The episodes play nice and smooth over our Roku box."
B006GM4JNU This is a great show for kids. It is one that does not need to be reviewed. Your kids can just watch it."
B006GM4JNU I like the show, but Candace gets on my nerves. She is such a drama queen and yells waayyyy to much. I think Phineas and Ferb are really cool, creative and smart though. The villian and Perry is also a cool part of the show. The villian is almost likeable. Which is good. He's just a bit misguided."
B006GM4JNU I will cheerfully admit to being a childless adult that enjoys this show. Kids can't appreciate so much of what makes this show funny. The songs are great and so are the characters. I cannot recommend this show enough. It is truly creative and deserving of your time."
B006GM4K2A This is by far my favorite Disney show.  I think it is very imaginative and smart.  My wife and I like it just as much as the kids do."
B006GM4K2A If you like the show you'll love this Phineas and Ferb season. It's fun for the whole family... even grandma!"
B006GM4K2A Mom loves the show for the pure genius that is Phineas and Ferb and their inventions. Son (who is an adult, but started watching the show when he was in the &#34;proper&#34; demographic), loves the antics and is seeing the layers of the show now. In fact, at work, one of the teams that Mom is on had a &#34;homework&#34; assignment where someone who had never seen the show (only one out of the 6 team members) had to report on what &#34;OWCA&#34; stood for. This is a show that adults can enjoy while the kids are watching, too."
B006GM4K2A My 6 year old son loves Phineas and Ferb and he is so excited to be able to watch them again as we haven't had cable in a while. The episodes play great over our Roku box."
B006GM4K2A The show has broad appeal to girls and boys; various ages and interest. I like the shows Imagination and modern approach to story telling."
B006GM4K2A My six year old loves it as does my husband. The only thing that gets on my nerves is Candane is an annoying drama queen. And the mushy love stuff between Candace and Jeremy and Isabella and Phineas is a bit too adult for kids. The evil villian is not scary at all. Perry and the evil guy are funny,but there is some physical violence between them. It's short lived but still short lived. Take a look and see what you think before you let the kids watch. It is meant for older kids age 7 and up."
B006GM4K2A I am a childless adult who was introduced to the show by a friend. It is genuinely funny and most episodes are memorable. The songs are great and the characters are strong. Kids can't really appreciate why it is so funny. Highly recommended."
B006H0602Y When I was 21, I worked in a convenience store.  No, I know what you're thinking, but that wasn't the impressive part.  While I was working there, one night a guy came in and asked me if I wanted to manage a rock band.  How could I say, \"No\"?OK; so I wasn't going to manage that band per se.  I was going to be a roadie.  Whatever.  But just like the lead in this film -- Ron Eldard, who plays his part perfectly with a bittersweet edge -- I sucked it up and I setup and I tore down equipment nightly, for the betterment of the band.  And Rock And Roll.I should have seen the writing on the wall when, one night, most of the guitarist's equipment was stolen from the back of The Van.  (And no, I wasn't at fault on that one.  I don't even think that I was important enough to have keys to The Van.)  But it gets worse.  Since I played guitar at the time, he asked me if he could use my equipment that night.  I said, \"Sure!\" which was really stupid, but it didn't work out as poorly as it could have.  At least neither my Wa-Wa nor Chorus pedal were stolen that night.But my final paycheck from the band bounced, which was surely a bummer, and that's how it became \"final.\"  I worked really hard for that money; surely harder than the band ever did.  I knew that they probably weren't going anywhere, based upon the fact that they were a local band, and based upon the fact that they mostly played Frat parties, and further based upon the fact that they weren't as well known as Blue Oyster Cult (BOC).Now, if you were a metalhead from that era, you surely had the opinion that BOC was borderline lame.  You had Ozzy Ozbourne, who had the great Randy Rhoads on guitar.  (Check out the scene where our protagonist is going back into his bedroom for the first time in many years.  An iconic picture of Mr. Rhoads playing his iconic flying-V is hanging on the wall.  Now there was a guitarist!  Unlike that hack guitarist from BOC, whoever he was.)  And you had bands such as Judas Priest and The Scorpions, who could go all cow-bell all over BOC.  Even on the worst of nights.I did find it interesting that the writer and director chose to go with BOC as the band-that-never-appears here.  Whatever.  That was fine.  Maybe they just paid a small royalty to use the name?  (And surely that royalty was small.)  Perhaps they wanted to use a lame band since our protagonist could be called -- and I apologize -- somewhat lame, even though he is very sympathetic.  But the band itself doesn't matter, as I give nothing away as I say that the movie begins with the protagonist being fired, via phone call, from the band that he \"manages,\" err, \"roadies\" for.There are quite a few themes going on here, but one of them surely is \"looking back, nothing was ever as good as it seemed.\"  Just by looking in his eyes, you can tell that the protagonist realizes all that he's missed out on in life by pursuing his dreams, dreams that surely never materialized.  But his \"friends\" -- they were more like \"frenemies\" -- regret their lives as well, as they believe that maybe he lived a better life than they ever did.  Well, they're both wrong of course, as all of their lives were perhaps just ordinary.Not to give anything else away, but maybe instead of trying to be a rock star, one should simply be happy with the simple things in life, such as being a gardener?  That might be the real moral of the story as the credits roll.  And perhaps, \"I need more cowbell -- AND more films like 'Roadie.'\"  A pretty big recommendation on a film that brought back many memories, at least for me."
B006H0602Y ------------------------------------------------\"Roadie\"(Magnolia Home Entertainment, 2012)------------------------------------------------Ron Eldard shines as the lead in this indie film, playing Jimmy Testagros, a working-class lug from Queens, NY who is brought down to earth after having spent twenty-six years as a roadie for his all-time favorite rock band, and then getting fired and having to confront the emptiness of a life spent on the move. Down on his luck, he heads back to his hometown and the cold comfort of his rock-poster filled room in his widowed mother's house. Bobby Cannavale plays his dramatic foil, a former high school bully whose grown up into a jerky, loudmouthed adult who lures Jimmy back into the same humiliating, imbalanced power dynamic that divided them as teens. Cannavale's character generates heat in the script but is a little overstated -- his jerkiness is explained by his being a cokehead, but it's still a bit much. A more subtle performance comes from veteran character actor Lois Smith, who plays Jimmy's half-senile mother, and whose subtle reactions and keen appraisal of her son's failings gives the film real kick.  Eldard's Jimmy -- mopey, charming, transparent and forlorn -- is a compelling character, likable though pathetic, a guy who's bottoming out yet remains charismatic and attractive despite his all-too apparent failings. This is a movie about accepting people with all their flaws, which is a message I appreciate -- it might be a little too depressing or one-note for many viewers, but it's definitely worth checking out. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)"
B006H0602Y By Jim Clark, publisher Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MSJimmy Testagross (Ron Eldard) has been living his dream for over 20 years. He has been a roadie for Blue Oyster Cult. The key words are \"has been.\" Blue Oyster Cult has quit filling large arenas and have cut back on equipment and personnel. Jimmy is a victim of that downsizing.Since Jimmy doesn't have any other skill sets he limps back home to his mother.He hasn't seen her or talked to her since his father died. She is developing Dementia. The band continues to tour in South America but Jimmy's repeated calls go unanswered.After seeing what has happened to his mom he makes up a more successful Jimmy. He says he's become the band's manager, even produced and written some songs for them and is simply visiting before he must get on the road again because, \"they are lost without him.\"Downtrodden he walks into town to get a drink. There he becomes reacquainted with his longtime nemesis Randy Stevens (Bobby Cannavale) who has inherited his dad's car lot and married the girl, Nikki (Jill Hennessy) who Jimmy uses to pine for. I should say still pines for.The problem is Jimmy never grew up. He still harbours the regrets and frustrations that he's carried with him. The road was the only thing that gave him a feeling of normal ... his only true home. Now he's forced to make a life changing decision - either step up, tell the truth and take on the responsibility of his ailing mother or continue to live a lie.This is a neat little drama filled with great music."
B006H0602Y Ron Eldard and the rest of the cast have a great movie here. So typical and excellent script. All the characterizations are dead-on."
B006H0602Y This movie is amazing. Let me share, perhaps against your will, some personal data. I am 53, going back to my hometown I left 30 years ago. I have a life time of experiences spent apart from my old friends and enemies. I will see some of my old friends and daughter from times long gone during this trip. The feelings I am having, and the imagining of what may come are so close to what this movie conveys. Going back, after so long, to see what has been and perhaps your life under different experiences. This movie seems so real that it feels like I could have experienced it. Don't miss this one."
B006H0602Y Blue Oyster Cult was/is a Long Island rock band that peaked in the mid-70's with the classic \"(Don't Fear) The Reaper.\" In this indi-drama, Ron Eldard (\"Super 8\") plays Jimmy, a roadie on their tour for the past 20 some years.  For reasons unexplained, he is fired, by telephone no less.  With no job, no money and no prospects he decides to go to the house where he grew up in Queens, N. Y.  His mother (veteran actress Lois Smith), hardly recognizes him.  Except for one day when his father died, Jimmy hadn't been back since he first left home and went on tour.While sipping a cocktail at a local saloon, Jimmy runs into an old high school nemisis (Bobby Cannavale) and his wife and Jimmy's former girlfriend (Jill Hennessy).  Nikki (Hennessy) is a struggling solo artist, but seems happy in her life which includes singing before 30 or 40 people.  We can pretty much see where this is all heading but, it really doesn't.  Although Nikki does stop by Jimmy's house and visits his old bedroom which his mother had kept intact (complete with vinyl albums and a working turntable), their high school memories are just that.There really isn't much of a story here.  The actors do their part well, but they don't have much to work with.  Although a night out with plenty of booze and cocaine produces an opportunity to let loose, the story peters out the next day.  In addition to some fine performances, the soundtrack should satisfy most from this rock and roll generation.The Blu ray transfer is in 1080p with a 1.78:1 aspect ratio.  The picture is fine if unspectacular.  A bit soft here and there but nothing problematic.  The DTS-HD MA 5.1 soundtrack is solid especially with the dialog.  I guess I was expecting a bit more with the musical influences.  Again, not necessarily of concern."
B006H0602Y I was at about 3-1/2 stars on this one.  It was a cool movie.  Kinda reminds me of going home, and seeing people you haven't seen in years."
B006H0602Y Somewhat slow-moving and depressing, but great acting and feels 'real'. Makes you think about what could have been, and the lead character's life is sad, but realistic. A good renter."
B006H0602Y Thoughtful and well-written.Thought provoking.  Opportunities, choices, consequences. It's strange to think that the decisions  made before age 25, when we are all impaired with an undeveloped brain, directs the course of our adult  lives. It's frightening to realize that our  immature self with no life experience or health insurance, focused on wine, women & song,  is choosing our life path .  No wonder we wake up at 40, 50, or 60 dissatisfied and paniced.  The dream we followed was that of a child, using the experience, knowledge, and education of a child to dictate our lives in retirement. How does that make sense? How does the 15 year old self, dreaming of being a Rock star,  playing air guitar to the radio  in his parents  home rent free, occasionally hitting them up for gas/grass money , possibly know  enough or have enough skills to make life decisions?  Thank goodness  for social security  and Medicare!"
B006H0602Y Roadie (2011) tells the story of a man who returns to his hometown, after being unceremoniously fired from his job of twenty plus years, as a roadie for the rock band Blue Oyster Cult (BOC).  It's a poignant look at the past and the present, as pride prevents the rocker from telling the truth about his situation, to his mother, and those he grew up with.  While the characters might seem a bit clich&eacute;d and stereotyped, when put together they complement each other, and seem to belong to the same universe.  Familiarity with the music featured in the film is not essential, but adds greatly to its impact.Jimmy Testagross (Ron Eldard) arrives at his childhood home in Forrest Hills, New York, and instead of telling his mother (Lois Smith) that he has been fired, he claims to be the manager for Blue Oyster Cult, and is visiting before the band leaves on a tour of South America.  Jimmy repeatedly calls and leaves messages for someone named \"Bobby\", in connection with his situation, but never receives a return call.In a bar, Jimmy runs into Randy Stevens (Bobby Cannavale), a guy that tormented him in high school, who dredges up unpleasant memories, when he uses the nickname \"Jimmy Testicles\".  Randy now owns a car dealership, and his wife Nikki (Jill Hennessy), was once Jimmy's girlfriend.  Nikki sings and plays guitar, and is at the bar warming up for a performance that night.  Continuing the lie, the couple are suitably impressed by Jimmy's \"success\", as manager and contributing songwriter for BOC.With posters of Phil Lynott and Randy Rhodes on the wall, Jimmy and Nikki listen to the music of the Good Rats, as they reminisce in his bedroom, which has been preserved like a shine by Jimmy's mom.  Later Jimmy is picked up by Randy, and is taken to a motel, where Nikki is getting ready for her show.  Fueled by music, alcohol, and cocaine, what starts out as a fun time headbanging to BOC's \"See You In Black\", later turns ugly, as old demons resurface, and feelings are hurt.Directed and co-written by Michael Cuesta (Homeland, Dexter), Roadie is a \"little\" movie that may not fully resonate with those who don't have the life experiences to appreciate some of its nuances, but most can relate to some of the basic themes being examined.  Jimmy's embarrassment is completely understandable, and his deception is like a sitcom clich&eacute;, where a boast or prank goes too far.  Peter on the Brady Bunch claiming to know Joe Namath, is just one of many examples.  In this case however, things feel more real, as matters don't play out as silly harmless fun, with several allusions to much darker possibilities.Ron Eldard (Sleepers) is perfect as a burned out rocker still trying to cling to the ways of his youth.  Waxing poetic on the significance of BOC, and the talents of guitarist Buck Dharma, Jimmy is truly in his element.  Still bitter that his father crushed his musical dreams, his success is largely dependent on the talent of others.Lois Smith (Twister,Five Easy Pieces) is spot on as Jimmy's mom, who still has the ability to transform the forty year-old, into a little boy.  Many could play a loudmouth prick, but Bobby Cannavale does it with an authentic sense of New York style.  The talented and versatile Jill Hennessey (Law & Order,Crossing Jordan), is always a pleasure to watch.  Her musical talents bring great realism to Nikki, who is struggling with her own unrealized dreams.  Hennessy performs part of \"Ghost In My Head\", the title track from her 2009 album.While not completely original, Roadie largely works because it is thoughtfully written, and features some extremely talented actors.  Providing ample opportunities for reflection, this is a particularly interesting watch for those who have faced a midlife crisis, and is punctuated by a selection of music, which adds firmly to the film's impact.  Among the featured songs are Robin Trower's \"About To Begin\" and \"Long Misty Days\", Jethro Tull's haunting \"My God\", Blue Oyster Cult's \"Cites on Flame\", and perhaps most apropos, as it deals with the life of a roadie, \"The Load Out\", which is unfortunately not the original version performed by Jackson Browne."
B006H06CFO Answers to Nothing almost became a 3-star movie but thanks to the final 30 minutes making a dramatic improvement in storytelling, it's only fair to award it 4 stars.  It's about four separate stories happening at once, and I'll list them right now:1- Dane Cook is NOT a comedian in this film.  Let that be known right off the bat.  Instead he cheats on his wife with a woman who looks and sings remarkably similar to the legendary Patti Smith.  As you can guess, he's cheating because he doesn't get along with his wife.  Unfortunately there's a few exceptionally graphic and inappropriate sexual related scenes in the very beginning that I didn't really care for, however I suppose having \"it\" happen during a story about a World War II soldier parachuting down to a house in France with an attractive inside is an interesting spin.  You'll see what I mean when you watch the movie.2- An African American woman who has a certain hatred for other black folks and seeks help with a counselor to figure out why.  Sort of pointlessly weaved into the storyline if you ask me, since if you were to remove this segment it wouldn't have been a big loss.3- An attractive blonde-haired detective woman who wants to bring down a potential suspect involved in the abduction of a child that she strongly believes is responsible for the childs disappearance.  Unfortuantely this segment was *severely* lacking.  At least, the scenes involving the detective.  There's a REALLY good segment with the suspect near the end concerning a house break-in that's easily the best part of the movie.4- A woman who has to take care of her paralyzed brother by bathing and taking him for walks in his wheelchair.  I suppose her intention here is to get into proper running shape so she can continue to have the strength to take care of him, but the fact that she was in desperate need of assistance because of how straining of a job it was leads to some interesting segments with her family later on, and especially memorable is the running marathon segment near the end.The only problem is that on a few occasions the storyline really drags, especially from the 30 minute mark until the 1 hour and 15 minute mark.  That's a good 45 minutes of lackluster entertainment that tells a decent enough story to get the job done, but never does anything that truly stands out.  This is why it's quite difficult to give the movie 5 stars.  However the ending is REALLY darn good- all the events are convincingly and thoroughly explained by the conclusion.  Good movie."
B006H06CFO Writer/director Matthew Leutwyler manages to challenge the concentration and intellect and attention span of the viewer in this non-linear and ultimately satisfying intertwining of stories that examine the bad in the best of us and the good in the worst of us. Against the backdrop of a child abduction case (person of interest is next door neighbor Beckworth (Greg Germann) we follow five days in the life of Frankie, a single parent detective (Julie Benz) assigned to the case, her best friend Kate (Elizabeth Mitchell) whose determination to get pregnant keeps her from confronting Ryan (Dane Cook) her psychologist husband's infidelity with rock singer Tara (Aja Volkman) while he is attempting to reconcile his parents (his fragile mother played by Barbara Hershey) long separation, an on-line video game addicted  school teacher Carter (Mark Kelly) and his obsession with the missing child that pushes him to the edge of vigilantism, a beat cop Jerry (Erik Palladino) grieving over the violent death of his wife, Drew (Miranda Bailey) recovering addict and her wheel chair bound brother Erik (Vincent Vinteresca)preparing for the LA marathon, and Allegra (Kali Hawk), a self-loathing African American TV writer's search for love who happens to be a patient of Ryan's (and who is on the brink of a mixed courtships with a shy and likely virginal Evan played by Zack Gifford). The string of stories asks us to look at their lives (and ours!) and to take action where it is needed to end injustice.The cast of characters is so strong that despite the rather confusing progress o the story we get to know each character very well.  The ending is exceptionally well handled.  This is one o those surprise films that appears on the surface to be one of those shallow/too much too fast director's egomaniacal art films, but by film's end the audience simply cannot fail to be touched in many different positive ways. Grady Harp, August 12"
B006H06CFO This is what we call a major league indy plot with loosely connected characters...intertwine is the phrase they like to use to make it sound artsy. There is a missing young girl. Beckworth (Greg Germann) the neighbor is a person of interest. Frankie (Julie Benz) is the investigating officer. Her friend Kate (Elizabeth Mitchell) is the sweetest thing this side of candy, and she is married to a psychologist Ryan (Dane Cook) who lies and cheats. One of his patients is TV writer Allegra (Kali Hawk) who is African-American and hates blacks. There is also a woman who cares for her brother. He is in a vegetative state. She wants to push his wheelchair in a marathon. There is also a rock band, the woman Ryan is cheating with, a rookie cop, and a teacher so obsessed with the missing girl, that it screws up his on-line video role playing game.The film builds up multiple characters in a mostly boring fashion. It isn't until the climatic ending that you begin to feel you have just seen a decent film. This film reminded me in many ways of another indie, \"Garden Party.\" If you don't like one story or character, wait it will change. The acting was exceptional well, however a story being all over the place is not everyone's cup of tea. If you are not an indie fan, you may not enjoy this feature.F-bomb, sex, nudity."
B006H06CFO Every now and then a gem that i've never heard of sneaks up on me.Once in a while when you read the plot on the cover of the dvd at the rental store it doesn't let you down.\"Answers To Nothing\" fit that bill for me.What a little gem this movie is!It starts with a little girl getting kidnapped from her bedroom in the night by a deviant but in between the manhunt for the criminal and her is a bunch od stories mixed into thru the movie.A woman who takes care of her invalid brother and desperately tries to keep custody of him,even enters both of them in the l.a marathon,very heartwarming story.A couple trying to conceive by artificial ensemination,a man obsessed with the child kidnapping case,etc.Rent it...you won't be disapointed!!! 5 stars easily !!!"
B006H06CFO \"I'm buried in the armor, I'm an iron man.\" After a child is abducted this movie deals with the following five days and a group of people including the single mom who is investigating the case. Her sister (Mitchell) who wants to get pregnant badly but her husband (Cook) is cheating on her. A school teacher who is obsessed with finding the missing girl. An alcoholic who is taking care of her wheel chair bound brother and a self hating black woman who wants to fall in love. I have to begin by saying that this is not a movie for everyone. Very slow moving in some parts and not a happy movie at all. That said I really enjoyed this. Dane Cook is a huge surprise in this role and is actually a very good dramatic actor. This movie shows how each person is somehow intertwined in each other's lives and how one life effects the other. While not nearly as good as \"Crash\" it does have that type of feel to it. This is a movie that you must be in the mood for and is a struggle at first, but the last half hour makes you glad you stuck with it. Overall, the type of movie that leaves you thinking about it long after it is over. I recommend this. I give it a B."
B006I0GSZM This is a mediocre rendition of a Stephen King novel of the same name.It dragged a great deal and was more unpleasant than scary.A shame as the book was great"
B006I0GSZM If you are a Steven King fan, you will love this movie.  This held my interest from the very beginning to the end. I love thriller and suspense movies and this one fit that bill.  I loved the story line and the suspense was on the edge of your seat.  Absolutely loved it!  I gave it 5 stars as the acting, story line and the fact that Steven King did it again........so well!  Highly recommend it."
B006I0GSZM As always, Stephen King knows how to deliver a story. This is no exception and for those who like his work, they won't be disappointed."
B006I0GSZM It must have been deliberate.  Pierce Brosnan, of all people, looks like Stephen King in this adaptation of his novel!  The novel was one of King's best because he managed at long last to combine a horror story with a love story.  Love stories prior to this had pretty much eluded him although he tried. The tv show is rendered in much broader and bolder strokes than the novel.  There is always that tendency in screen adaptations of novels though.The scary stuff is plenty scary.  There is ghost after ghost in creepy rendition after creepy rendition.  If you are in the mood for horror, this is the tv show for you.The protagonist's wife is killed  in traffic while he is at a book signing.  He is devastated and retreats to their lakeside home in Maine. There he begins to wonder if his wife was seeing someone else.  He also meets someone new but she is locked in a custody battle with her child's rich paternal grandfather. It turns out to be a lot more complex problem though than an affair or a custody battle.  There is a mystery going back to his grandfather's generation which affected a circle of young men from the 1930s.King's best screen adaptations were Kubrick's THE SHINING starring Jack Nicholson, Rob Reiner's STAND BY ME with the late River Phoenix, Christopher Walken starring in his DEAD ZONE, Kathy Bates in her Oscar winning role with James Caan in MISERY and Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie in CARRIE. Those are pretty lofty standards for others to try to meet.  That is heavyweight film talent. They are all either Oscar winners or Oscar nominees. So doing it on tv with a good actor, but hardly a Walken, Caan or Nicholson, gives this less of a chance right from the start.  BAG OF BONES is a good job but it is not up there with these now classic five star films."
B006I0GSZM I also watched Bag of Bones on DVD which is based on a novel by Stephen King. I bought the book years ago on the bargain shelf at Barnes & Nobles. I read it quickly and loved it. When the miniseries aired back in December, I had other things going on and I didn't get a chance to watch it. Bag of Bones is good, but several things have been changed and left out from the book. I love ghost stories, so I naturally love it despite of it's flaws."
B006I0GSZM This Stephen King adaptation is much more entertaining and colorful than many of the other reviews here let on.  I'll admit, important elements of the novel were missing in this mini-series.  The single-mom character was much more complex and fleshed out in the novel, and some of the stranger, more interesting images and scenes from the book didn't make it into the movie.  However, I thought the ghost-story-mystery aspect of the film was old-fashioned and deliberately paced, and I thought it was very entertaining.  I like the fact that the movie slows down to tell the story without a lot of quick cuts and abrasive sound effects.  Pierce Brosnan's obsessive grief comes across as completely credible, in my opinion, and his performance goes a long way in making events believable.  Is this a higher-end King adaptation?  No, it is not.  However, I did think it was fun and engaging.  You might want to give it a chance if you're a fan of the kind of atmosphere and scripting that older ghost stories take on (Ghost Story, The Changeling, etc.).  After all of the terrible reviews I've read for this, I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie."
B006I0GSZM I thought it was good and wished it would have continued. The storyline was sad, but it was well written and there were times when I couldn't tell what was real and what was not real."
B006I0GSZM Had read the book many years ago and decided to watch this. Almost four hours long, if remember correctly, in two parts. Good acting and a very engaging story line. I am used to the edgier approach of movies instead of the restrained presentation of TV movies. That said, it was time well spent."
B006I0GSZM The sound was excellent.  The costumes, brilliant. Acting was right on for King 's book. It is thoroughly enjoyable entertainment."
B006I0GSZM Out of Stephen King's countless books, \"Bag of Bones\" is probably the easiest to adapt -- it's a straightforward ghost story about revenge, murder and writer's block.So of course it was eventually adapted into a TV miniseries of the same name, with Pierce Brosnan playing a bestselling author (take a shot) staying in a small Maine town (take a shot) with some ugly skeletons in its closet. The first half is a tedious affair, mostly setting up various clues for Brosnan -- but the second half is a genuinely disturbing, heartrending tale.After his pregnant wife Jo (Annabeth Gish) is killed by a runaway bus, writer Mike Noonan (Brosnan) is understandably devastated. He also finds himself unable to write, so he ends up heading off to the Maine lake-house that Jo had been fixing up for several months. He also is grappling with suspicions that Jo was unfaithful to him, since he was told that they couldn't have children.But during his stay, he begins to see strange ghostly events -- fridge magnets spell out messages, strong winds blow, and the music of 1930s blues singer Sara Tidwell (Anika Noni Rose) plays. Soon Mike figures out that there are two ghosts: one is Jo, and the other is far more malevolent.He also inadvertently becomes involved in a custody battle between wealthy, cruel Max Devore (William Schallert) and his beautiful daughter-in-law Mattie (Melissa George) over Mattie's young daughter Kyra (Caitlin Carmichael). But as Mike tries to figure out why Devore wants his granddaughter, he learns of a string of brutal murders stretching back through the years -- and the terrible crimes that started it all.The first episode of \"Bag of Bones\" moves at a very slow pace, primarily devoted to setting up the clues and the whole custody battle. In fact, a lot of it is about Mike drifting around, struggling to write and having strange visions that are (of course) prophetic -- and if it weren't for the occasional ghostly visitations, you might forget that this is a Stephen King story.One advantage of the slow episode is that it gives Brosnan plenty of time to develop Mike. Yes, he's another bestselling writer character with a personal tragedy, but it feels so much more REAL with Brosnan. He really makes you feel the life-destroying anguish of losing your spouse (possibly drawing from experience), and the passionate paternal feelings that Kyra stokes in him.But the second episode lashes together the horror, clues and custody battle into one dark, bloody package -- and suddenly the horror is flowing pretty quickly. Ironically, the most horrifying part is the human capacity for brutality (a graphic rape-murder scene, the attempts to kill children), but there is still plenty of ropy-faced zombies, curses and the occasional crazy old crone throwing rocks or scissors.One major problem, however, is Max Devore and his crazy sidekick Rogette. These characters are so utterly, revoltingly, sadistically evil that they become cartoons rather than antagonists -- it wouldn't surprise me if they tortured puppies for fun. And it's never really explained why various men want to kill a kid who isn't theirs. Do they think it will lift the curse? I have no idea.It takes its sweet time to drag itself to the horror content, but if you can hang on through the slow, character-building first episode, \"Bag of Bones\" is a dark and heartfelt ghost story."
B006I0GSZM First, it should be mentioned that I am a Stephen King fan. As far as I know, I've read all of his books, and \"Bag of Bones\" was one of my favorites. I loved everything about it- the summer Maine setting, the characters, and the \"traditional\" ghost story setup. It would be unreasonable to expect every detail of the novel to be crammed into a two episode TV mini-series. Instead, the producers did a great job of cutting where they had to, making small changes where necessary, but mostly retaining the story and the FEEL of King's \"Bag of Bones\". Be warned that it can (and will) get cheesy at times, but that's part of the charm.I watched this on rainy October evening, with a warm Labrador curled on my lap, a mug of hot chocolate near at hand. This was a great experience- nothing too mind blowing or horrific (I'm not a huge fan of horror movies); just a good, comfortable ghost story. It's mostly a harmless affair, with moderate amounts of tension (undoubtedly reduced since I had already read the novel) and no excess gore. Instead, the story revolves around psychological fear and exploration, with a solid performance turned in by Pierce Brosnan (King fans are lucky to have him on board for this TV adaptation). If you're fan of King's work, or ghost stories in general, grab a mug of hot chocolate on a cool fall evening, tune in, and enjoy."
B006I0GSZM Why people should expect a movie to emulate a book makes no sense. They are totally different mediums with their own strengths to be taken advantage of and weaknesses to be avoided. They are separate stories that share a common bond. Example: I thought \"Help\" was better as a book (actually what my imagination created) than as a movie but the movie had it's acting strengths.As far as \"Bag of Bones\" it was too formula driven and loaded with stereotypes. Usual writer searching for inspiration; loses wife; goes to rural Maine (of course); encounters murder mysteries; has dreams; has romantic affair; things turn inexplicably on and off; windows/doors/drawers open & close; bad townsfolk are hiding a secret; spirits appear; spirits lose power when dug up. Help! How repetitively redux.Acting was OK but dialogue sounds like it came from a too cloistered Hollywood writer - simply not realistic conversations. CGI effects of ghostly dead people was standard '40s movie making boring. Some effects were more laughable than scary such as lightning hitting a sign which happens to land on and kill some townsfolk (cheaply shown as an old pickup catching fire) and a tree that looks sort of human shaped that gives a jolt when touched, finally a CGI face appears on the trunk while a branch or two take a swat at our hero-writer (the trees in \"Alice...\" and in \"Wizard of Oz\" were scarier)."
B006I0GSZM Fantastic story line and great acting.  Several twists and turns with intrigue and horror to make you hang on to every moment.  If you haven't seen a movie that deals with a good mix of supernatural and reality, you don't want to miss this one."
B006I0GSZM It's been many years since I read Bag of Bones, so I don't know if I'd be nitpicking the details of this movie more if I'd read the book more recently, but I thought it was solid.  Like most TV movies, some of the acting was really good, and some not so much.  Pierce Brosnan as Mike Noonan was a highlight.  He's one of the most accomplished actors to take a lead role in a Stephen King adaptation, and he didn't take it lightly.  Many actors struggle at being believable in a supernatural tale, but I thought Brosnan came off as genuine in every scene where he interacted with the forces around Dark Score Lake.  He also did great expressing Mike's grief in the first part, showing that he still has formidable dramatic talent.  Being a longtime fan of King, I can't help but think it's incredibly cool that a former James Bond played a Stephen King character.  I'm sure King didn't mind it too much, either.  Out of the other important characters, I thought Max Devore was done well, and the girl who played Kyra did an excellent job.  Mattie, Sarah Tidwell, and Jo were passable, and most of the secondary characters, like Bill Dean and the housekeeper, were fine.  Lowlights for me were Mrs. Devore, who was cartoonish, and the officer who harasses Mike. Like I said, though, you can't usually expect an all-star ensemble when it's made for TV.  On that point, some of the special effects aren't so special with the TV budget, but some of it was actually quite good, particularly a couple of gruesome death scenes and some zombie-esque ghosts.  This movie also has several old-school horror \"jump\" moments that are effective at startling the hell out of you even though you know something is about to happen. All in all, I've seen worse Mick Garris-directed films, and maybe only a couple that are better.  Brosnan carries the cast, and the source material is strong enough to make for an entertaining 2 and 1/2+ hours.  It felt to me by the end that I had experienced something close to a novel, with enough mystery, drama, and suspense to keep my full attention.  I'd give it a solid B."
B006I0GSZM Mike Noonan (Pierce Brosnan) a novelist with writer's block after the tragic death of his wife Jo (Annabeth Gish)  decides to get away to their summer place by a lake. He has high hopes to communicate with his wife beyond the grave and he soon starts to once he arrives. But the ghost of a dead singer, named Sara Tidwell (Anika Joni Rose) also starts to communicate with him their through an old recordplayer.He also finds himself in the middle of a custody battle between a widower, Mattie (Melissa George) and her evil father in-law Max Devore (William Schallert) when he saves Mattie's daughter from getting hit by a car. Since Max is a powerful man, he wants to bully Mike into admitting that Mattie is a bad mom and that she wasn't watching her child. In-order to help Mattie's daughter, like Jo wants him to, Mike must discover the town's dark secrets.The film is a decent adaption of the Stephen King book, but that's all director Mick Garris, is capable of, either decent adaptions, like this and the Stand or really bad ones, like Desperation. What makes Bag of Bones only decent is that it just moves along slowly with Pierce Brosnan acting pretty casual about being haunted or the other strange happenings. Melissa George acts pretty casual about the strange things going on as well. The director, takes an interesting story and manages to make it kind of dull and not even scary.I think a more talented director could have got better performances out of Brosnan and George since they aren't bad actors. Garris should only be handed King adaptions that weren't big successes. For instance, he needs to be kept away from the Dark Tower, Under the Dome, Duma Key, Insomnia, the Talisman or anything else that has potential as a movie or mini-series."
B006I0GSZM Whenever another television adaptation of a Stephen King novel comes around, I always feel a little wary. Some of his supernatural offerings seem better suited left to the imagination as opposed to getting a literal screen treatment. That's not to say that there haven't been good interpretations. There have. But there have been just as many failures as successes. If anyone should have a sense of King, it is director Mick Garris who collaborated on previous TV efforts include \"The Stand\" and the much maligned \"The Shining\" miniseries. For me, \"Bag of Bones\" falls squarely in the middle ground of King's television presentations. It has been simplified and changed in ways that purists and/or fans of the novel may not appreciate. But for those unfamiliar with the story, it has its share of pleasures as well. For those expecting big scares, however, the pacing of this two-part miniseries may be a little off-putting. I would describe this as a melancholy murder mystery enhanced by supernatural elements as opposed to any kind of horror show.Not surprisingly, King sticks close to the topics he knows. The protagonist in \"Bag of Bones\" is (once again) a popular writer, played by Pierce Brosnan, who is pushed to the brink of sanity in picturesque Maine. Reeling from a personal tragedy and trying to push through writer's block, Brosnan settles into his family's lakefront country estate. The town is populated by a typical array of eccentrics including a plucky single mother (Melissa George) and an evil town bigwig (TV stalwart William Schallert). It seems that this quaint little berg has seen its share of unpleasantness with a series of murderous drownings through the years. Brosnan starts communing with spirits in the afterlife, and the central mystery seems to have something to do with a blues singer named Sara Tidwell (Anika Noni Rose) of a bygone era. Past and present meet as Brosnan seeks to establish a connection and put a long standing mystery to rest.The leisurely pace allows the viewer to really get to know Brosnan, and he gives a solid lived-in performance. The cast also has Jason Priestly, Matt Frewer, and Annabeth Gish (perhaps the most underrated actress working), but none of them has anything to do before all but disappearing. George is likable enough, but the teleplay doesn't really establish a relationship between her and Brosnan before forcing them together. Schallert is menacing fun and his female companion is a hoot. Noni Rose gets a couple of welcome musical numbers, but isn't developed with much depth. Everything is so straightforward and uncomplicated in this adaptation, it is never very hard to envision where the screenplay is taking you. And when you finally get there, it is so rushed and rather unconvincing.It's fair to say that this adaptation of \"Bag of Bones\" lacks the subtleties and shadings of the novel--but that's probably to be expected. If you aren't anticipating big thrills or an exact replication of the book's plot, I might still recommend this for Brosnan's performance. Without commercials, this clocks in at just over three hours. I, personally, liked this slow build (although someone who watched with me declared it a snooze-fest). I just wished that when we got to the conclusion, it had offered up something of a surprise. Still, it was enjoyable enough. However, it is not a particularly memorable endeavor when you think about all of the King adaptations that have been produced through the years (would they and could they all be made by Frant Darabont for the big screen!). KGHarris, 12/11."
B006I0GSZM I love Pierce Brosnan so this show was a shoe-in for me to begin with.  Though it used a lot of cliche scary effects, it had an net resting enough plot to keep me intrigued."
B006I0GSZM This lost my attention ten minutes in. It was stupid, flat and boring and I never finished it. It didn't live up to Steven King's other works."
B006I0GSZM I have always loved the imagination of Stephen King and this series on A&E; called the \"Bag of Bones\" relates to what I had been through with the loss of the only man I have ever loved.  The thinking they are there in a room with you or they have sent you a sign telling you how to handle their passing.  Pierce Bronson is perfect in the role and the rest of cast was chosen well.  That is one thing I like about Stephen King he does not let Hollywood or Television change his stories they are just like the books he writes.  Wonderful Series and I intend to buy it to see them all on my laptop to know how it ends is what makes King a great writer, as you never know how he will end his stories.  Great work this series is by a wonderful writer of so much that a world enjoys the challenge of how the story proceeds and ends.  Thank you Amazon for giving this to your customers to enjoy....Link to Bag of Bones Series -http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006I0GSZM/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
B006I0GSZM It's what I'd watch when there was nothing else at all and I had gone through all my DVDs and feel like &#34;well, that was OK&#34;"
B006I0GSZM Not my cup of tea.  Used as background noise while using my PC mostly.  I really don't think casting a British &#34;pretty boy&#34; as a Maine outdoors &#34;man&#34; fit the part either."
B006I0GSZM This is how I choose movies from the Roku my husband got for his birthday from my daughter.  It was a tense and unsettling to watch and a satisfying end.  I'm giving it 4 stars because I waited too long to write this and think I would remember it better if it were 5 star material.  Still think I'll be watching it again, which is a good test of the experience."
B006I0GSZM The story was a bit contrived but the acting excellent.  Always a surprise ending with Stephen King who leaves you hanging until the last."
B006I0GSZM Pierce Bronson plays Michael Noonan, a New England author, in a continuing of Stephen King's write about things you are series. When is wife, who he truly loved, dies, he is drawn to their lake home. Noonan has nightmares about his wife in the final scene of \"Quarantine\". At the lake home he inadvertently gets involved in a local drama and discovers some small town secrets that frankly would make a good novel, which BTW he has to write.I enjoyed the simple ghostly images and hauntings. Noonan takes the paranormal in stride as he tries to uncover more about the illness known as Dark Score Crazy which causes people to drown their daughters. What is unfortunate is any Stephen King fan can watch the film and see where the master has done this before. For instance when we see the computer screen with the same line written over and over, one can not help think about \"The Shining.\" The question begs: Does King want us to think about \"The Shining\" and give us a clue that Noonan is crazy or is it a deliberate misdirection? Or maybe King is starting to recycle old trunk novels as does the writer in the story. Outside of Noonan, the characters were poorly developed, especially considering the length of the film.While I enjoyed the film, I have come to expect more from Stephen King.Made for TV. Includes a rape scene."
B006I0GSZM I enjoyed watching this mini-series duo of broadcasts. The acting is good. Brosnan is convincing as the main character. There are some odd situations, but the plot carries you along most of the time. Since there are only 2 episodes to this series, the viewer is quickly pushed to the main character's situations. It would have been nice to have 2 more episodes or more to flesh out settings and characters. The topping to this is a classic Stephen King ending... you'll know it when you see it."
B006I0GSZM That's about it.  He is engaging, but the rest of it is actually a dull slog despite the storyline, violence, and other characters.  Too bad.  I am sure the book was better; I read it some time ago, since I always read King's work."
B006I0GSZM Adapting a Stephen King novel to the screen has proved to be a dicey proposition for writers/directors in the past.  Either the film is a huge hit (like \"Shawshank Redemption\" or \"Green Mile\"), or it turns into a B-movie that doesn't nearly live up to the billing.  In the case of \"Bag of Bones\", director Mick Garris does a remarkable job of translating the page to the screen.For a basic plot summary, \"Bag of Bones\" sees writer Mike Noonan (Pierce Brosnan) struggling with severe writers block after the death of his wife Jo (Annabeth Gish).  To try and break out of his funk, Mike heads to his summer retreat home on Dark Score lake, where Jo had frequented often.  While there, Mike meets Mattie Devore (Melissa George) and her daughter Kyra (Caitlin Carmichael), who draw him into a haunting (literally!) mystery surrounding town baron Max Devore (William Schallert) & the unexplained death of 1930s jazz songstress Sara Tidwell (Anika Noni Rose).What makes \"Bag of Bones\" really work is the fact that it doesn't stray too much from the original King subject matter.  It had been awhile since I read the novel, so I can't nit-pick all that much, but the film seemed to do a good job of sticking to the script, so to speak, and not deviate from King's wonderfully compelling (and spooky) tale.The acting, for the most part, is also quite fine.  Brosnan is very capable as the lead, while only a couple of the key auxiliary roles are sub-par.  Special credit needs to be given to little Ms. Carmichael, who really gives the show its emotional kick throughout.About the only thing this film doesn't translate well from the book are the \"villain\" characters (you'll know who they are after you watch).  In the book, I seem to remember much more character development about them, which was excised from this adaptation likely due to time.  It shows a bit in the end, when t
B006LG7IJ8 What I love about this show is there isn't one second that isn't outright silliness.There is so much comedic creativity here. The two lead characters even do gender reversals with the woman dressed as a man with his girlfriend in her red wig played by the man. And they do it so well including the voices, that it's easy to forget who is whom and just laugh.The people are all whacky, the situations are all outlandish, and the entire city apparently is off kilter. I can't wait to go there after watching this. While this is extreme craziness I do feel that there is a lot of truth here about how Portland actually is after knowing some charming delightful people from there. I was wondering if it was just this particular group of friends that seemed funnier than people I know on the east coast or what but now I'm thinking it's a funny place in general.This show keeps the spacey hipster goofiness coming at you non stop. It seems like the initial burst of steam the first season displayed has quieted down several notches.It's still funny but not hilareous like it was. And what makes it so special is it seems to frequently feature situations we are all familiar with. Waiting in line for hours at a popular restaurant for a table, overeager parents of a preschooler trying desperately to get their boy into the right preschool, the child hearing his parents making funny sounds in the bedroom, are some of the episodes.This show is more creative than most things out there and is a breath of fresh air. Not many shows make me smile and laugh any more but this one lightens my mood better than any."
B006LG7IJ8 I was hesitant about this show. I am not sure why, but I put off trying it for a long time. Then I heard some interviews with Carrie Brownstein and she seemed like an interesting and intelligent person so I decided to watch the first season. I liked it, but I was not blown away. At some point in the second season that changed. I laughed as hard as I have ever laughed in my entire life at some of the sketches in this second season. I was actually in physical pain from laughing at some of the sketches. That is when I knew I was a convert.The writing on the show is excellent and very consistent. Obviously, some sketches are funnier than others, but the percentage of really funny sketches on this show is, I think, higher than any other sketch show I have ever watched. I have also come to really love the recurring characters. I think that is part of the reason I liked the second season better than the first. It took a little while for some of the characters to grow on me, and I think it took me a little while to really figure out the sensibility of the show, but now that I have figured out the sensibility, and gotten to know the characters, it has really become one of my favorite shows.Fred and Carrie are also really good comic actors. That is probably no surprise with Fred since he has been a staple cast member on Saturday Night Live for ten years, but it is amazing to me what a great comic actor Carrie is. She delivers her lines perfectly. Some of the humor in this show can be subtle. Some of it is not subtle at all. But a lot of it is the kind of comedy that would not necessarily crack you up on the page, but delivered correctly it is genius, and Fred and Carrie always deliver it beautifully.The whole show just has a really great feel. Every sketch feels like the kind of thing that you come up with when you are sitting around with your friends and someone says something funny, or introduces some funny premise, and then someone else takes it further, and someone else takes it further, and so on, until everyone is laughing so hard they can barely stand it. Watching this show is like that. The show really feels like it is just friends having fun and it seems, from the interviews I have seen with Fred and Carrie, like that is an accurate account of how this show came into being. I think that whole sensibility carries over into the show and makes it a really enjoyable viewing experience.There is one sketch from this season that I have to single out. It was the sketch where a bunch of kids are at a museum and Fred and Carrie are playing Lewis and Clark. I don't know what it was about that sketch. It is a really weird sketch in some ways, but I am not exaggerating when I say that I laughed harder at that sketch than I have ever laughed at anything in my life (\"I don't know why you're running!...They are still running...\") Any show that can take such a weird, silly, premise, and make me laugh that hard, deserves my absolute seal of approval. If you have been hesitant about this show, as I was, I recommend giving it a try as soon as possible."
B006LG7IJ8 Penny Marshall guest starred in this show. The small part was perfect for her. Portlandia is not for everyone, the humor is a acquired taste but I enjoy the quirkiness of the characters."
B006LG7IJ8 The humor is clever but not funny for me personally. I get it but a big &#34;so what&#34; in my way of being. I prefer comedy which has me laughing out loud some of the time and holds my interest."
B006LG7IJ8 I used to live in Portland, kind of get the self-conscious posturing of Portland denizens; kind of phony, but at heart sincere and well-intentioned. Carrie and Fred have nailed the lifestyle-I remember waiting in line for an hour for famous pancakes that supposed to be organic, natural and healthy, but were as dense as corrugated iron. Enjoy the easy-going spoofing and seeing the sites of Portland-it really is a beautiful place."
B006LG7IJ8 I love these crazy actors! they'll do anything for a laugh, the impersonations of the west coast portlandereeer's is extremely funny!"
B006LG7IJ8 In their continued, playful lambasting of hipsters, progressives, and weirdos of Portland (not to mention their smaller sister of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, ahem), Carrie and Fred do a marvelous job of bringing fresh fun to sketch comedy. Not only can they pickle eggs, cucumbers, and assorted inedible objects, they can also give just about any concept their funky \"pickling\" treatment.The chemistry between these two is downright magical, and the variations in the identities they assume is stunning. You always know that it's Fred and Carrie (obviously), but the transformation in their delivery and personality as they change roles is fascinating to watch, along with the mostly subtle visual changes (like Fred's awesome selection of wigs).Favorite moments from Season Two include Andy Samberg starring as a mixologist in one episode, Fred and Carrie attempting to take over the role of Portland law enforcement, and the induction of Kevin into the band \"Cat Nap\". Looking forward to Season Three!"
B006LG7IJ8 As a Portland resident, I'll admit that it's nice to see the town in high-quality photography, and I'll agree that most of the caricatures are quite spot on. However, I've never been a great fan of the show for a couple reasons. One is that the same ideas are milked over and over, often using the same characters, with no new ground being broken. The feminist bookstore is probably the best example: Each successive skit in that setting seems to be just a variation on the original idea, without reaching for additional substance or a new perspective. Another problem is that Armisen and especially Brownstein seem to equate inarticulate mugging with comedy. This just in: They're not the same thing. Sputtering your lines, raising your eyebrows or tossing objects is no substitute for true humor. There are some skits that are nice in the way that a short poem is, and of all the routines in this season I think the Battlestar Galactica one is truly inspired, though it does go on a little too long in the middle. This series is adequately diverting most of the time, but it's hardly as good as it thinks it is. Still, I'll keep watching in hopes of someday seeing Union Station in high definition...."
B006LG7IJ8 By this season they were like 50's jazz at Birdland.  If one player ever became predictable, others would counter or shift it.  Every episode is a mini Christopher Guest movie...which means exaggerated silly and absurd behavior from characters who often lack self awareness.  The \"Catnapped\" episode may even be funnier than the Sarah Silverman Program's \"Tab\" episode or Eastbound and Down's \"Cookout\" episode."
B006LG7IJ8 This show twerks the quirk. What can I say, it's so strange that I love it. It reminds me of that stuck-up boyfriend I had that always went on and on about &#34;PORTLAND is so GREAT because..... &#34; with his nose in the air. He was such a tool. I sincerely hope he moved there and drowned in a craft beer. Ugh. Anyway, unlike Jeremy, this show was cool. The city seems to be a lot like East Nashville- kind of insufferable, but adorable, in the way a small, confused child is when they're constantly running after shiny new toys and getting obsessed with every new fad they see.God I love this show. I guess I'm kind of like the people on it, which is why I really hate it so much. I'm so confused. Inside every hipster is a lot of self-loathing, mixed with an equal amount of self-importance. I'm so confused. Great show, though!"
B006LG7IJ8 Porlandia and its inhabitants will be familiar to anyone who practices green ethics, shops at the coop and is generally left of center (and proud of it!).  Hipsters, old hippies, overly involved parents and trendiness are all given a wonderful satirical going over in this show.  My personal favorite...\"Gotta get the Gear\"..... since I definitely buy too much junk when I get into a hobby.  You do not have to live in Portland to enjoy this...Eugene, Davis, Eureka or any of the other small cities that are inhabited by us greensters will do.  I laugh at each episode and recognize myself in the sends ups.  Good fun.  Well I am off to REI and Trader Joe's cause I gotta get the gear."
B006LWHBDA I chose this rating because its really just all informative reviews of their opinions in what they do and how they do it when they go to these auctions.  Most reality shows are stupid and don't have meaning or purpose.  Just a bunch of people getting together to tell the world of their lives and businesses they make money off of.  It is okay for some people; there are better things to watch for entertainment.  My husband watches this stuff.  It is a waste of my money and my time.  Somethings shouldn't be aired more than once or twice and this is one of them."
B006LWHBDA Fun show to watch for quick laughs, it's not &#34; Under The Dome &#34; it's like a 30 Min. sitcom but some funny characters to say the least."
B006LWHBDA Same as the original storage wars but with a colorful Texas twist. Love the down home accents. This is a keeper."
B006LWHBDA I liked this season better than the others do far. Only a few into it but the players are comical"
B006LWHBDA I buy auction units in Southern California in Dotson territory.  These guys are really nice and make the auctions fun.  My issue is the California show has run the price of the units sky high.  My wife and I will watch the show and say what we would pay for the auctions in question.  We always seem to be to low for California but right on for Texas.  The characters in this show are good and the merchandise that is won is pretty interesting.  I would like to go to Texas to go to one of these auctions just based on this show.  It is fun to watch and it is a good time.  Watch it, you wont be disappointed."
B006LWHBDA I believe a lot of these shows are fake, meaning that the situations are scripted and the valuable items are strategically placed.  Whatever.  Even if this show is like that (and, I'm not sure if it is or not), I watch these shows to learn about antiques and collectibles.  This show has that!  They buy some cool stuff and I'm learning about different items and what their value might be. Don't watch it to critique the reality of the episodes.  Watch it to learn and see some cool stuff coming out of the storage lockers!"
B006LWHBDA This first season is 6 shows long and that's really short for a show. I have seen the first 4 shows so far and that's like almost the whole season. lolSo far, I thought this show was exactly like the original Storage Wars show. Everything seems the same, but the people on it. I believe the people on the original show is much better. They bring a more interesting view on their finding and explain more about what they see and find before and/or after they see a locker. While this show does the same thing, they don't do it as well.These Texas people do bring some different elements to the show. They more likely to bid low and keep low on their bids on lockers. They don't go buck wild like the City Folk as they call them in Texas. They all have similar but different personality to the original show cast members.Moe similar to Barry.Dave similar to VictorBubba and Ricky similar to Darrell and Brandon.Ricky and Lesa are similar to Jarrod and BrandiThis show is recommend if you really like the original Storage Wars show."
B006LWHBDA I love watching this show and seeing what treasures are found. I'm addicted and will watch to the very end."
B006LYWJR6 Muriel who lived in a small oceanside town dreamed of being happy. She wanted to be loved and wanted friends who really were her friends. She was a simple girl who really didn't seem to understand the way the world worked. Her father was a brow beater who's never ending diatribe of how awful and unworthy his children and spouse were in his eyes didn't help her self esteem much. She made rash decisions that were mostly poor ones. However, in the end she did manage to figure it all out with the help of a devoted friend. Her unorthodox wedding to a high stakes athlete was a mistake that proved both good and bad for the girl. While navigating the treacherous friendships that were superficial at best and short lived with girls who found the only thing important in life was status she found herself. It was hard and it was heartbreaking but it was funny as well. This movie was unique and the music was of course awesome! Who doesn't love ABBA?"
B006LYWJR6 An Australian chubby girl who dreams constantly of her wedding and the tricks and subterfuge so she was involved in in trying to reach her goal. A thoroughly dysfunctional family is of no help."
B006LYWJR6 This was an odd movie, off beat to say the least, but it hooked you in so that you wanted to see what was finally going to happen, as Muriel's character developed.  The ending was worth the wait"
B006LYWJR6 Ok, first time I watched this I was like wtf? A month later I came across it again and this movie really grew on me.1. The cast is all relateable in some way, if that's not enough the humour and accents are enjoyable on their own2. The plot moves a little slowly at times, but it makes up for it in the more dramatic scenes that lead up to/ after them3. It
B006LYWJR6 \"Muriel's Wedding\" is the Majority of Girls thinking, when you are NOT the Popular Snob in School, Family or Work.  Oh, but there is payback for those, who think they are better than everyone else.  When you come out behind that shy timid girl and have grown into a beautiful butterfly that attracts men like bears to honey.  I was like Muriel when I was 14 and oh the first class reunion, the night clubs that I was the one to know to get into, and the boys, who thought they were too good for me.  Payback can be fun and that is just what I did, they asked me to dance and I had a guy far better in looks, manners and personality, so I said, \"No thanks I am with someone\".  To every wall flower and shy timid girl there is a day you will turn into that butterfly and enjoy it, as long as you can.  You see you always were someone and now they know it, as well as you do.  You are the dancing queen the one, who makes all of them jealous.  Be proud of who you have become, because you are a special person and never forget it my friends.  Toni Collette, as Muriel the bride was great, she played the girl, who was shy and timid and wants to be like the popular girls, who do not want her hanging around with them.  While Muriel goes on a vacation she meets a old high school friend named Rhonda, played by Rachel Griffiths, Bill Hunter is Muriel's Father Bill a critic of every single person in the family from his wife, to all 6 children and shows how he is having a fling with another woman.  The ending is great and the story fits 80% of the women in our world, who have not become that butterfly, who spreads her wings and takes off for better places.  Muriel does and finds herself to become the person she was meant to be and tells her father that \"NO, I am not going to come back home and take care of your children, you take care of them I am going back to Sydney!\"  She does so bringing Rhonda with her and that is how the movie ends.  It is a Great Comedy, Wonderful singing by Toni Collette and Rachel Griffiths doing an ABBA number and dancing to the music as they sing on stage.Below is the link that every girl and woman should watch on a Friday or Saturday and thank yourselves for finding, who you really are:B006LYWJR6"
B006LYWJR6 A-W-E-S-O-M-E! If you're ever having an OFF day.  This is your ticket to BLISS.  Five star and for good reason.  It helps you learn, laugh and want to dance while gleefully saying I'm #1. I'M #1. Because you really are."
B006LYWJR6 I noticed that this, one of my top 25 favorite movies, was available for streaming with Prime, and read some of the reviews.  I was floored to see some of the poor reviews.  Not that it must be everybody's cup of tea, but how is it people can watch and not have a CLUE what it's about?  Minor spoilers as to themes follow.Yes, it's offbeat.  Yes, it's told in an unusual way.  The old adage \"Show, don't tell\" is followed throughout, and perfectly so.  But for goodness sake- isn't the time spent viewing a movie worth a little reflection on its meaning?  The absurd events of Muriel's life mirror the absurdity of life writ large.  The movie's about a young woman who wants desperately to BE somebody.  She's shy, awkward, weird, doesn't know how to behave, inevitably says and does the wrong thing.  The in-crowd shuns her, and still she tries to gain acceptance.  Those efforts are demonstrated against the backdrop of relations with her dysfunctional family of misfits.  She resents and yet is an amalgam of her parents- her mother, fat, insecure and self-loathing, her father, a grandiose liar who will go to any dishonest lengths to seem important, make the news, garner attention by any means possible (he's a politician).  The mother just wants to be valued by her husband and children, to no avail.  Muriel's younger siblings are even more pathetic than she, and actually look to hapless Muriel for inspiration and guidance.  Oh my.The movie is about Muriel's quest to find out who she is and find meaning in life, the Holy Grail of quests (though not necessarily her realized goal- at first she just wants to LIVE).  She tries various desperate things, some inspired by her parents' behavior and values (I won't list them), but the biggie is finding a husband and having a fancy wedding, however possible, by hook or by crook- THAT will show everybody.  She gets herself into trouble ever more deep.  In the midst of all this, she meets an old school chum, someone slightly more evolved, who doesn't care WHAT other people think (the fabulous Rachel Griffiths).  Griffiths becomes a friend and role model, has an effect most profound on Muriel.  They get an apartment together, and Muriel just begins to spread her wings- and tragedy hits.This movie is all about life, fraught with disappointments, unkind people, and misfortunes foreseeable and unforeseeable (and yet- there are other ways to look at it).  It's about seeing yourself anew, taking the blinders off.  It's about the myriad ways we delude ourselves, inventing things to value and feel good about- often valuing style and mere appearance over substance and character.  It's about longing to change, to be your own person, to be a person of integrity, instead of a colossal screw-up.  And parenthetically, what is integrity?  So few people exhibit it.  And yet, it's everything, the most essential thing- without it you've got nothing.  And finally, it's about what it truly means to love other people.  Or so say I, anyway- these were some of the things I came away with.Come to think of it, these are some of the themes of another wonderful Toni Collette film (an adult drama), made a few years later,Japanese Story.This sounds like solemn stuff indeed, but it's not, that's what's so wonderful- the reality seeps into your emotional pores through osmosis, themes reverberate between a series of intriguing, memorable scenes, some funny, some ridiculous, some tragic (e.g., her mother's clothesline in the back yard.)  No-one hits you over the head with anything, you figure it out for yourself.  The ending of this movie is one of my favorite film endings ever- things look pretty bad, how could they get any worse?  But DON'T count this fat, pathetic loser out YET.The triumphant scene where the cabdriver throws opens the cab door, with ABBA playing, is one of those quintessential, iconic movie moments that etches itself into your very psyche: \"Leave 'em burning and then you're gone...\"  I saw this in a large theater when it came out, and it got a standing ovation.  If you don't like this, or at least appreciate the themes, you must be made of wood.  This movie made marvels Toni Collette and Rachel Griffiths international stars, and rightly so.  BRAVO."
B006LZSF8M If you must watch this I would say watch teh first half and turn it off, as soon as you hit the horrorifying slaughter house footage, its downhill.This could have been a really powerful wonderful documentary but instead decided to be over the top Peta ad.All the hidden footage of animals in slaughter houses are not given enough context.Go watch Forks over Knives you will learn more."
B006LZSF8M i really don't believe that an all veggie diet is the way to go but these people are convinced. Just buy responsible so you know what your getting"
B006LZSF8M This movie is a must watch, along with the movie chow down. People, we are killing ourselves with what we eat. Go back to nature and live to be healthy and old. It teaches you how to spend as much time on earth as taught in the bible."
B006LZSF8M No hard sell on going vegan. I was open to going vegan but the film affirmed my view that vegans are so disgusted with factory farming that  they opt out all together. The film on cruely and animal abuse in factory farming, which they showed to their three New Yorkers  , willing to give it a try,  seemed to have the biggest effect.They were traumatised . As most americans would be if they chose not to turn a blind eye or were exposed to the sickening cruelty as suppressed by corporate interests.However it encouraged me to investigate if cage free eggs were more humane or Perdue chickens and their not. So the film 's a reminder to those of us trying to do the right thing and be more vigilant in sourcing animal food/ products farmed humanely.I think a film on changing diet to be more vetarian with a little/less meat and where to find it and being sure to verify pervasive fraudulant claims ( that are somehow still legal) is more useful.  Whatever- this over-comsumption of meat and dairy within the last century  is not sustainable enviromentally or in health costs; we need more films to make the transition than turn vegan. I did not feel it was very representative that 2 out of 3 of the film's guinia-pigs were  persuaded to turn vegan in the end."
B006LZSF8M This is an excellent film about three carnivorous New Yorker's who give veganism a try - and like it (more or less). It is pretty humorous until they get to the animals-in-industrialized-hell footage, then it's hard to stop weeping (or maybe that's just me). I highly recommend this film."
B006LZSF8M This was ok but the story development seemed disjointed. I hoped to really learn more about vegetarianism, benefits, outcomes, etc. and just got more reality TV."
B006LZSF8M First up, I've been a vegan for nearly a year and I can attest to the transformational effects it has on your health, fitness, attitude and lifestyle. I've been a single-person marketing campaign for films such as Forks Over Knives and Fat, Sick and Nearly Dead, both of which illustrate effectively the positive effects of a plant-based diet (beer is plant based, woo-hoo). Personally, I think the biggest negative of veganism is the stereotyped baggage that follows which I try to fight all the time - vegetable eaters aren't all smoking weed in their drum circles trying to fight the man.While I support any effort to show people how the Western diet is bad for your health, this film comes across as more of a PETA commercial than an attempt to follow 3 people willfully changing their lifestyle. I'm completely against the way that mass farm treats animals but spreading the vegan word must surely come from illustrating the gains that individuals make rather than having a political agenda about animal treatment. That said, what is shown in the film in the animal processing facilities is disturbing and the public should be aware - but let's make that a focus of a different film.For me, this film lacked the journey promised in the subtitle about following 3 New Yorkers becoming vegan which could have been funny, personal, touching and dramatic. As a contrast, I think Forks Over Knives is a substantially more approachable film for non-vegans and doesn't press the animal cruelty buttons to guilt people into quitting hamburgers."
B006LZSF8M Real people and real life circumstances made this documentary very easy to watch and understand. It was well constructed and kept me very interested in watching it. I learned a lot too."
B006LZSF8M This film approaches American Agriculture and diet lifestyle from the perspectives of three citizens who are newly educated about the film's topics and ideas. Their reactions and changed lifestyles are the convincing themes of the documentary. Very different from the other films on this thread, this is one for those who don't like to watch documentaries.There's no question that the film both educates and entertains, albeit with moments passed cringing in reaction to what  the daily, ordinary behaviors of American agriculture are."
B006LZSF8M This film really opens your eyes.  I didn't realize just how badly many animals are treated.  It was interesting but there was a little bit of language.  My family has been vegetarian on and off but now we are going vegan between inhumane practices (even with organic farms!) and other health concerns I think we need this."
B006LZSF8M I thought this would be a nice little film about what to eat and how to get healthy as a vegan. Not so much. I should have known when they went to the grocery store and she was showing them what was and wasn't considered a vegan product. Did you know Oreo's are vegan? Yep! Wow, and so healthy for you...  That's when I realized the film maker wasn't so much interested in spreading a message about how to get healthy eating as a vegan, but was more interested in proving that eating animal products was contributing to animal cruelty. Yeah, and don't even get me started on all the soy crap they \"discover\". Soy is not a health food, people!!Personally, I already know all about how animals raised for food are treated. I read \"Diet For a New America\" many years ago and it totally opened my eyes. I was not interested in seeing that again. I understand that she wanted to prove a point, but I don't like the idea of forcing people to see that sort of thing without a warning to begin with. It felt like the filmmaker's only justification for being a vegan was the fact that animals raised as food are treated badly. It wasn't about health at all. The message I got was \"become a vegan so no more animals have to suffer\".And, if you don't know anything else, you're going to watch this and believe that ALL food animals are treated inhumanely.I had to stop watching this movie about half-way through, so maybe it isn't fair of me to give it a review, but I think it's important that other people know before going in, what's in store for them. It wasn't what I thought, and I don't want that message forced down my throat. I'd rather watch \"Food, Inc.\" I thought it was a million times better than this."
B006LZSF8M This film's goal is to educate you as to the health benefits of a vegan, or at least vegetarian lifestyle, but even more, it is dedicated to educating people as to the horrible atrocities committed to fill the shelves in the meat section of your local grocer. It basically takes three people from different lifestyles and challenges them to embrace a vegan lifestyle for six weeks. During those six weeks, as they are learning how they can eat properly without meat or dairy products, they are also exposed to the dark underbelly of animal butchery and production. The film is very graphic in this respect, showing the inside of chicken, beef, and pork production plants and farms. One scene shows the castration of a cow. Very disturbing. The film also teaches about how, just because a label says free range, organic, and cruelty free, it doesnt really actually meet those standards. For example, when we see 'free range', i think we all have a picture of an animal traipsing about a meadow until it's slaughter time (which is gruesome enough). In reality, they are still kept in small pens and squalid conditions, but are simply not confined 12 chickens to a single tiny cage. They show how chicken beaks are melted off to keep them from fighting in the cages. They show a lot. In fact, if you were to watch this film, i think you might view the consumption of meat and dairy quite differently, from both an appeal standpoint, and also from an ethical one.There is some sloppy editing in this film, including at least one glaringly obvious misspelling, but t
B006LZSF8M The trials and tribulations of neophyte vegans.  Interesting but not inspiring, at least not to me.  It may be noble to be vegan but the film lacked energy."
B006LZSF8M So enlightening about the sources of our food and what is actually nutritious.  Of course, I worked for a meat packer and was steered away from the slaughter floor several decades ago, but somehow it just seemed necessary.  Older is wiser and a revisit to the scene makes me question what I eat though years ago I reduced serving sizes and use some vegetable protein in cooking I was still eating fish, eggs, milk products etc.  Well produced to direct you to thinking about what you are putting in your body at who's expense.  Watch it with your kids.  Definitely more important than gun control and can save your life."
B006NU7C48 I'd not seen any episodes for several years.  I have seen Jennifer Saunders, Joanna Lumley, and Julia Sawalha in many other projects and always enjoy their work so figured since I had the chance would watch some f these episodes.  I admit, it takes a few minutes to get into &#34;the grove&#34; of the shows.  Once pulled in they are hilarious. For a real treat check out season 6 episodes also."
B006NU7C48 After her daughter having a baby, I wondered where this show would go, but this episode was SO FUNNY that I had to consciously not howl out loud! So glad I kept on watching it!!!"
B006NU7C48 I often as I watch this I never grow tired of it. May be we all need a moment of fabulousness"
B006NU7C48 I used to watch this show a while ago, the first two seasons.  Viewing it as a therapist, it is a sad show and not really that funny."
B006NU7C48 These ladies are priceless!  Their antics remind one of middle school girls with addiction issues .  You could definitely binge watch these episodes..."
B006NU7C48 I was disappointed with Seasn 5 episode 1. Not nearly as fun or clever as previous seasons. Just not up to snuff"
B006NU7C48 I love this show. So funny! My favorite British comedians. The writers are amazing and this is one of my favorite series"
B006NU7C48 Eddy & Pats are my idea of the perfect pair. They remind me that no matter how corrupt and decadent you are, you can still be hilarious"
B006NU7C48 I love british humor and this is wonderful!!!!  I have actually watched all of the seasons several times and I never tire of them"
B006NU7C48 The show like the other seasons are very, very, entertaining. I love the characters and they played they roles very convincingly."
B006NU7C48 Lotsa fun.  Reminds me of my own selfish flippy-dippy hippie youth.  So refreshing to see ladies who know how to have a good time and are not constantly yammering on about their tedious tots and the tubby hubby.  Martha Stewart would be pitched into the Thames without ceremony.  No white sale at Penney's here.  Highly recommended."
B006NU7C48 This is still one of the funniest but most irreverent comedies ever made for television.  Jennifer Saunders writing and her performance as well as that of Joanna Lumley are simply priceless in their depiction of a pair of aging, vain, shallow, self-absorbed boomers who are wealthy enough to get into plenty of trouble but still envious of those with more.  The perpetual social climbing, lubricated by more than ample alcohol, and peppered with hilarious unbridled condescension (and sometimes outright bigotry) skewers the former Sloane Rangers more pointedly than any other satire of the era.Don't start watching this series without beginning at the beginning.  It is necessary to see the whole series to understand the preposterously endearing relationship between these two aging relics and truly enjoy the humor."
B006O2WRHM My two year old loves gabba. Loves gabba. We watch an episode every single day. The songs get stuck in my head but they are catchy. As an adult I like the guest stars and the bands they have on the show. I also like how the lessons teach proper social behavior and norms, like sharing and not biting people."
B006O2WRHM We have all the seasons so we had to purchase this one as well. Unfortunately it has much fewer episodes than the other seasons. My daughter's favorites are Farm and Gooble. I found myself enjoying the Farm episode myself, and my daughter loves me to sing the garden song to her as a lullaby. Super Music Friends Show is her favorite part of the whole show. No matter what she's doing she always gets up to dance. I think it's super cute and fun, and less annoying for adults than many kid's shows."
B006O2WRHM My 2 year old son has been watching Yo Gabba Gabba since he was 4 months old. Yes, he actually watched it. The music kept him happy when he was very young. He still watches it to this day. He sings the songs, dances with them and everything else. It's one of the lesser evils on TV for kids (my personal opinion)."
B006O2WRHM Our girls love this show, and all the toys. Our girls watch the typical cartoons, like Disney toons, Dora, etc. - but YGG gets them up and DANCING. This show is great!"
B006O2WRHM I did not like Gabba Gabba at first. It was not like the shows I watched as a kid, but none are these days. I'm 65 and Ding Dong School and the old Mickey Mouse club. But my 2 year old granddaughter loves this show. She sings the songs and loves the dancy dance time and follows the story lines. The characters are much like their counterpart human children and the kids seem to get this. It will not bother me to see Ruby talking with nostalgia about this show when she is in her 20s."
B006O2WRHM When I first saw this show I was like nope. After watching it a couple more times I saw the good message it sent & my daughter loves to dance & sing a long!"
B006O2WRHM My daughter's favorite show. This episode is cool. I wish they'd film new episodes, but the episode with Jack Black is definitely our favorite."
B006O2WRHM My two year old freezes in place when we put yo gaba gaba on. Then he mimics DJ Lance's dance moves. Great show!"
B006O2WRHM My child will watch anything YGG.But, Tori Spelling - pregnant - with tunic riding up in back?That's worse than getting hit in the face with a snowball.Every time I see the show, I know behind it all, there aredads laughing.Leslie and Tori, we can tell you were dressed bymen cutting fabric with safety scissors, who let their daughtersdo your makeup. But have some pride ladies,little girls are watching!"
B006O2WRHM My Autistic son doesn't have very many favorite shows but this is one of them by far.  He even has tablet games related to the show."
B006O2WRHM As a grown-up , I am not quite sure I appreciate this show but the kids love it...especially the 3 to 6 year olds. The message of the show is positive and encouraging of diversity. It can get a bit silly but it is definitely a feel good experien
B006O3Z39U Ghost Hunters started very modestly but has become something of a showhorse. The exit of the humble Grant Wilson was a foreboding of a slicker production lead by Grant's less humble buddy, Jason Hawes. the strange hirings and firings of last season break open with a new season of celebrity guest stars and questionable evidence. Ghost hunters must be credited, though with the current interest and methods of paranormal investigation copied by so many others."
B006O3Z39U This is a series my wife and I find irresistible.  We have never been disappointed.  If someone would reply letting me know why the recent seasons aren't available with Roku (or other devices), I would greatly appreciate it!"
B006O3Z39U Will always enjoy GH. Their travels take them places that I would never have considered and the investigation finds along the way make it an enjoyable program."
B006O3Z39U I watched the very first episode but decided that enough was enough. Over the last 8 seasons I have watched as this show has went from interesting paranormal research to scripted reality. This episode was no exception. I have no words on how disappointed I am in Grant and Jason. When the show started they presented Ghost hunting in a positive light. With proper ways to investigate and going to real people's homes. Now they just look like abunch of bafoons. Jason never believed in everything they heard/saw, but now he cops to anything. It use to be personable and watchable, now it's just a joke. They 'jumped the shark' when they brought in the ghost hunting dog. Thanks Grant and Jason for destroying something I loved all in the name of ratings!"
B006O3Z39U I love this show. It is absolutely my favorite show on tv. BUT, WHERE IS IT!!!!!!! I love the show. I love the people, their interaction with each other and the spirits. I absolutely believe this is a credible show and that what they are doing is real. I love the technology that they use and their professionalism and competence. And I think this next season is going to be one of the best, but I can't find it. I was in the middle of purchasing whole seasons and poof gone. Help me tell syfy that people are cutting the cable cord and need Amazon to have access to this. I'm sure they would make more money by people buying seasons than paying cable. This is a great show you learn allot and get real thrills unlike with sparkly vampires or gruesome not got to watch movies!!!"
B006O3Z39U I was worried that Ghost Hunters would not be as entertaining anymore without Grant but I was wrong.  If anything, the newer shows are even more chilling.  Of course, that is no reflection on Grant and I do miss him."
B006O3Z39U Just good old ghost hunting at its best . I think ghost hunting should be about gathering evidence of the paranormal. Not so much entertaining the audience but rather explaining the how and why ghost are there and trying to prove it."
B006O3Z39U Steve and Tango still my favorites. They make ghost hunting fun."
B006O3Z39U This season was good. I have watched almost every season from the beginning.I hope they keep that new investigator(not Michelle but the other one) She seemed down to earth and relaxed. She wasn't trying to show off or anything. I hope they bring her back. Michelle lied on the Acadamy. She was not a good investigator, She just seems like she doesn't want to be there. Adam however blew me away. Adam was a great choice. I love Adam and Amy. Amy has really stood out since Kris left. I love watching Adam and Amy. They make a great team. As well as Britt and KJ. We will miss Grant, Steve and Dave are always fun. But Jason needs his buddy Grant. :("
B006O3Z39U I viewed this show on a suggestion from a friend 5 yrs ago and was pleasantly surprised at how great it is . I am hooked."
B006O3Z39U Another great list of investigations from the ghost hunter team, this time they go to more great places, and catch great evidence! I can't wait for part 2 to come out, i'll be glued to that dvd as well!"
B006O3Z39U I'm a Ghost Hunters junkie but do not have cable.  Getting this by instant video on Amazon is the best legal, way to keep my K2 meter flashing."
B006O3Z39U Not too bad an episode, wished they had gone over all the EVP's with the client they found. Still strange without Grant.. and not sure about Jason's very fast spoken commentary."
B006OU14BO better than a soap opera , and its real, kinda. its fun to watch tho. keep it coming... LOVE AMAZONNNNN"
B006OU14BO Where I live now there's very little going on, so this is great and fills a need to see people going through the grinds and joys of life together, even though these are some tough streetwise cookies. I guess that's what makes it fun."
B006OU14BO but it grasp my attention based on how they chose to live and the so call friends they surround themselves with ..."
B006OU14BO The crescendo for these women really takes off once Karen's father is ratted on by Junior and a line starts to be drawn against Carla for her instigating nature."
B006OU14BO Drama, fun, facts, friendship, style, a way of life all rolled into one. a new twist on an old story."
B006OU14BO Well people this is # 2 of a killer Italian girl bad asses show! I love these girls big time! Drama baby! Get it for your collection!"
B006OU14BO these ladies are as real as it gets and that's what I love about this show. this season was entertaining and full of drama, I can't wait to see season 3!!!"
B006OU14BO This was pretty good.  I hope that these women were hamming it up for the show because I can't really believe that grown women would act that way."
B006OU14BO Too much fighting, too much he say, she say. These are grown woman in their 40's. I can believe how they carry themselves. We all hate Karen and Ramona, these are terrible woman. Happy to know they will eventually be leaving the cast. We all like drama in a show but this is ridiculous from these very old woman."
B006OU14BO The women start to become friends, they are Clearly making money and you just know the other shoe is about to drop. Makes me want to do a show about my family"
B006RECSBC In all honesty, if I see one more cat jump out from behind a door, I'm going to shoot my television.  I just can't bring myself to understand why anyone, ANYONE, would think that that was a good idea.  As a film director, how can you justify building a suspenseful sequence around an animal of any sort, but especially a cat, making noise in a dark corner and then popping out just when you think you're about to see something really terrifying?  It's beyond my comprehension.That being said, a stupid scene like the one mentioned would not and should not be enough to entirely write off any horror film.  It happens so often in horror films that you'd basically have to write them all off.  What CAN cause you to write off a horror film would be the fact that it just isn't scary.  I'm struggling because I honestly can't decide whether or not this was supposed to be taken seriously.  Maybe this was supposed to be a comedy or a spoof, you know, like `Scary Movie', but I know that it's not and that makes me confused.  This has got to be one of the most unintentionally funny films I've ever seen.  Each scene looks like something out of a poorly crafted comedy.  It reminds me of when I saw `Darkness Falls' and I laughed throughout, which is not the reaction you want from a horror film.Clich&eacute;s abound in this messy film that centers on a haunted hotel that is going out of business.  The employees are obsessed with the rumors surrounding the ghost haunting the hotel and they do everything they can to stir stuff up.  God, none of this works.  The performances are so affected and mannered and just bad and the direction is completely uninspired.I've seen a lot of bad films this year, but this may be the worst."
B006RECSBC This is one \"horror\" that fails to deliver on all counts.  While there was a brief period in the first half when I thought the film contained a substantial amount of atomsphere that I'd probably be able to end up giving the movie 3 stars, unfortunately it never improves.  The nonsensical communication between the two main characters ends up wandering WAY too long and thus, completely destroys all potential this movie had.  I fully expectd an improvement in storytelling to eventually occur but, again, it never comes.  Basically other than the surprise ending, the Innkeepers disappoints.It's about the character of Sara Paxton roaming around a hotel with a haunted history.  She apparently works there at night.  A computer-obsessed geeky guy plays the role of the second biggest character and he works behind the counter... I guess.  He spends most of his time on the computer or sleeping upstairs so his job is really easy.  He's more like an arrogant know-it-all that never wins me over that's for sure, whereas Sara is more of a curious almost jaunty teenager constantly on the alert and jumping around at the slightest bumps she encounters in the night.  The other characters that occasionally enter the picture (such as the old woman in the room upstairs and the curious old man that wants a specific room because it contains memories) never accomplish anything meaningful and simply feel tacked on for the sake of character diversity.Well apparently this old hotel is haunted, so Sara spends all her time walking around exploring at least half of the rooms.  Most of her time is spent in the main room downstairs.  However, the problem is that (despite a complete lack of atomsphere and horror of course) on several occasions, Sara and the geeky guy basically mock the supposed hauntings taking place here, and the scene with the two of them pretending to investigate a real haunting only to hide under the sheets and rise like a ghost was the breaking point for me- the Innkeepers HAS to be 2 stars.  If you're going to mock horror *in* a supposed horror movie, you're going to fail miserably.  Simple as that.The little bit of blood and suspense during the final 10 minutes isn't the least bit frightening either.  The surprise at the end *is* pretty good at least.  Unfortunately by that point, you have to sit through over 80 minutes of boring, plotless nonsense 
B006RECSBC Ti West has done his monster / zombie film w/ THE ROOST, his satanic-panic film w/ HOUSE OF THE DEVIL, and now comes his ghost story w/ THE INNKEEPERS. This is another throwback to earlier, simpler times, when horror was built upon a firm foundation of ever-increasing dread. West captures the essence of the haunted inn, making the place itself a character, and not just a setting. The human characters are believable, the spectres are jolting, and the atmosphere grows thick w/ gloom and impending death. Don't go into INNKEEPERS expecting a HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL / 13 GHOSTS carnival ride. It's meant to get under your skin, not give you big, non-stop thrills..."
B006RECSBC I screened this film the other day and was totally surprised.  Pleasantly surprised.This movie is very funny and quirky, especially at the beginning.  As the film progresses it becomes more terrifying, but the director did a very good job of taking his time and building the suspense.  While watching, I actually started thinking about the whole \"found footage\" (FF) genre, if that is a genre.  Now, this is surely not of that genre, thank god.  I have to admit, if I see another FF movie I am going to, well, scream.  Not scream from fear but scream from boredom and pain.Probably the reason I thought of the whole FF genre:  the two main characters here - a guy and a gal who have temporarily taken over running a hotel just before it closes - have their own video cameras and equipment, and are trying to record evidence of a ghost in the hotel.  Now, Sara Paxton is very good here and very funny; and Pat Healy is excellent as well.  Even Kelly McGillis gives a nice performance as a, well, psychic, I guess.I guess the critics really liked this film but the average viewer did not.  I think that I know why.  This film plays it straight; it doesn't rely on some lame twisteroo at the end.  I liked that alot.  If you are a twisteroo fan - there are many of those out there and twist away - you probably won't like this film.  But for me, this was a very refreshing idea:  no twisteroos!  Whoda thunk it?A surprisingly big recommendation here."
B006RECSBC The two remaining innkeepers at the Yankee Pedlar Inn get more than they bargained for when they set out to capture evidence of the hotel's legendary ghost in THE INNKEEPERS, Ti West's highly-anticipated followup to HOUSE OF THE DEVIL. Once again, the director moves to impress with his incredible talent for balancing a slow, deliberate pace with clever characters and spooky suspense, though the same can't be said for the plot, itself. Sara Paxton and Pat Healy couldn't have been more perfectly cast as the two awkward leads, bringing their own dry wit and innocent charm to the characters. For all West's skills as a writer and director, however, he is found lacking as an effective storyteller. He simply doesn't know where to go with his films, and as a result, they typically fall apart in the final act. THE INNKEEPERS is no exception. While we have fun sitting back and laughing with his two bumbling hotel clerks, the questions set up in the first several chapters are left entirely open-ended, and the mild shocks do not compensate for the lengthy build and anticipation. Still, it is impossible to deny the man's skill behind a camera. Even the most trivial scenes are made interesting through his keen visual style, which keeps the audience glued to the screen despite t
B006RECSBC Ti West really is one of the best... He builds suspense so well, and with The Innkeepers the story cracks you up as much as it makes you crap your pants. I love this film... I saw The Conjuring last weekend and I could only compare that film to this... Same film making style... I feel like James Wan and Ti West are the only ones right now reading the same \"No Cheap Tricks\" horror playbook... Seriously, the best horror is like a good boxer, full of jabs, fake outs, and ultimate surprise KOs.P.S.I know you can stream this one on Netflix, but the two commentaries on the DVD are worth the price. They are really funny and insightful ... You really get the feeling that this cast and crew bonded while simultaneously getting cabin fever in the hotel while shooting."
B006RECSBC For months leading up to my viewing of this film, all I heard was how clever and creepy and worth-my-time it is.  Am I missing something?  This seemed like pretty run-of-the-mill stuff.  I agree with many fans of Ti West that he is a talented director who knows how to exercise restraint (House of the Devil was really good) and give his films character.  However, despite the good direction, atmosphere and acting, I can't get past the fact that the ghost story in The Innkeepers was nothing I haven't seen before.  Unless, like I said, I missed something.  I watched this with a good friend whose opinions are pretty close to my own, and he agreed with me that House of the Devil was much better than The Innkeepers.  If you're a fan of this type of ghost story, and you're a bit older than the twenty-something set (like me), then you've probably spent a lot of time watching ghost stories just like this.  Throwing a bit of ambiguity into the story near the end didn't do much to help its plot, either.  I don't know, maybe someone out there can tell me what's sailing over my head because I just don't get why so many people are rallying around this movie.  I just felt it wasn't that good even though I really, really wanted to like it."
B006RECSBC Movies revolving around the supernatural have always felt lacking. Of course, the most recent ones are mostly remakes so they already have an uphill battle ahead of them but there are very few movies featuring ghosts or the supernatural that I feel are worth mentioning in a conversation about great films. Ghostbusters, The Orphanage, The Shining, Shutter (the Thai original), The Ring, The Frighteners, and The Devil's Backbone are about it for me. It's a sub genre of horror that just hasn't meshed well with me over the years much like exorcism films. In the same breath, I still haven't been able to get a clear read on what I think of Ti West as a writer and a director. The House of the Devil was really disappointing. Its slow pace made the film seem practically uneventful and didn't really feel worthwhile in the long run. The Innkeepers has a similar pace as The House of the Devil yet feels slightly more methodical on West's part in comparison.Luke (Pat Healy) and Claire (Sara Paxton) are the only two employees working during the final days of the Yankee Pedlar Inn. This hotel is rumored to be haunted by Madeline O' Malley, a woman who hung herself in her room after being stood up by her fianc&eacute; at the altar. Luke and Claire try to make contact with the paranormal through EVP recording devices in between watching the front desk and handling the few stragglers who come to stay during the hotel's final weekend of operation. Needless to say, Luke and Claire begin to see results as the guests at the hotel become a bit stranger.I'm surprised the score to The Innkeepers was as good as it was. It's a little bizarre to have such good things to say about movies coming out in between January and March since these are the months that studios decide to push whatever's been sitting on their shelf for a long period of time or release something they expect to do poorly at the box office. The score is really fantastic though, especially during the opening credits. It's usually very strings heavy and puts you on the edge of your seat on more than one occasion. It helps add that extra bit of tension. At other times, a lack of music speaks volumes. The way the film encompasses the importance of sound into t
B006RECSBC Quaint, enchanting, cute - these aren't words normally associated with films about a haunting, but they are more than apt for describing The Innkeepers.  If you're wondering if this can even be considered a horror movie, I can assure you that it does earn its horror chops when all is said and done (although I think the trailer oversells the scare factor).  What I took away from the movie, though, was a rather poignant sense of melancholy.  You aren't going to find many horror films that run you through such a gamut of emotions as this one.  It's an unconventional but really impressive piece of work from writer/director Ti West.The setting is the historic Yankee Pedlar Inn, on the final weekend before it closes its doors forever.  With only one floor open and three rooms booked, young Claire (Sara Paxton) and Luke (Pat Healy) are all the only employees left to see the inn through its final days and hours.  Their focus, however, is in trying to prove that the venerable old hotel is indeed haunted - supposedly by the ghost of Madeline O'Malley, a young bride who reportedly hanged herself when her lover abandoned her on her wedding day.  Luke has created a web site about sightings of the ghost, but it is Claire who seems fixated on making contact with Madeline before the inn closes its doors forever.  Claire is quite a character - young, unfocused, highly excitable, and just incredibly cute.  She definitely doesn't seem to have the temperament of a ghost hunter, as several comical scenes early on make clear.  Personally, I found her infatuating, and I thought Sara Paxton's portrayal of her was almost magical.  Kelly McGillis also turns in a strong performance as actress turned new age healer Leanne Rease-Jones, a character who comes to play a crucial and prophetic part in the story.The Innkeepers is devilishly hard to describe.  In a way, much of the story is predictable, yet at the same time it's also rather shocking in the end.  The writing is subtly brilliant.  The significance of some lines early in the movie only hit you later on, even after the film is over.  It sounds stupid for me to describe the story as both conventional and unconventional, but I think that is a true statement.  Those who like their scares blatant and numerous probably won't like the film, as it's really not a scarefest.  The Innkeepers is a ghost story in the traditional sense, full of subtle nuance and dare I say intellect, playing out in a little world where the characters are more important than the events that befall them.  I loved it."
B006RECSBC A lot of people have reviewed this flick and some thought it pretty much bit the big one, while others thought it went more for spooky nuance than the big scare. For the most part, it did go for nuance, but there were still some cheap scares. So I'm siding with the former.Here's the scoop. A vintage New England hotel, the Yankee Pedlar, is closing down. The owner is in the Barbados, and two young folk are left to man the place on it's final weekend. The only guests are a mother and son, a one-time actress turned psychic and an old fellow with fond memories of the place. The hotel has a reputation for being haunted by a ghost tied to a particular incident. The kids want to record evidence of the haunting. Of course, things get out of hand.The only other film I've seen from writer/director Ti West was \"The House of the Devil\" and I liked it quite a bit. This outing, however, is a real stinker. There were individual scenes, between the two leads, that I liked quite a bit, but the sto
B006RECSBC Ti West does it again with The Innkeepers. Just like his The House Of The Devil, he spends the first 2 acts building tension with mystery, intrigue and a bit of comedy, then slapping it on heavy in the third act with the reveal and real horror. The House Of The Devil was a throw back to 1980's occult horror, this movie is a throwback to classic films about haunted buildings, like The Shining. Sara Paxton pleasantly surprised me as charming, cute and funny in this movie and really carried the film. While this movie may be predictable like most movies about ghosts, there is a nice kind of twist at the end that weaves everything together well and If you aren't looking closely at the final shot, you may miss a very nice little treat. Way better than I expected it to be, especially since most horror movies are a let down. I should have known better because I thought The House Of The Devil was brilliant, and this movie is no exception. I thought this movie was great. On Blu-Ray it looks clean, crisp and sharp. There is no visible DNR, blacks are deep and there is visible film grain. There is also a little bit of specks on the film b
B006RECSBC The first 20 minutes or so the dialogue and acting led me think that a creative, well written and produced haunted movie was in the works. Wrong! They either quickly ran out of writing inspiration or money or both. It quickly fell into a cheap formulaic abyss. The rest of the movie moves like redundant molasses.Proof?(1.) Well, lots of newspaper clippings is a cheap storyteller and in this case it was newspaper clippings on a web page - shown over and over.(2.) Usual cheap prop of an army surplus recorder with analogue vu display to indicate some unknown sound. Duh, digital has been around for decades and, anyway, they have a limited frequency and amplitude range, so what's the point.(3.) Usual, couple of guests that add nothing to the story and you're left wondering why they were even in the story. Well, one guy decides to slit his wrists, in a bathtub, of course.(4.) Usual, mysterious sounds - well, they are in an old hotel!(5.) The usual mysterious self-closing door. Actually, a prop person standing behind and pushing it. Scary!(6.) Lack of details such as why the two inn employees are there; why they are closing such a expensively appointed and well maintained inn. Their dialogue dominates the rest of the movie and although it started out interesting it simply got tiresome after 90 minutes.(7.) Usual chain locked cellar door.Spoiler follows:(8.) Usual girl starts imaging ghosts and locks herself in the basement to subsequently die of fright complications thinking a ghost is chasing her but it's her co-worker banging on the door."
B006RECSBC I definitely think Ti West is one of the best directors working today after seeing this movie.I used to have mixed feelings about him before because I loved Trigger Man but hated House of the Devil and The Roost.  I thought Cabin Fever 2 was okay.The Innkeepers is just an excellent movie through and through, though it seems like nothing happens until the very end the build up is just as enjoyable.The fact that the characters are so likeable and so well developed makes what happens at the end so much scarier.Normally i hate ghost movies but this was just great.Sarah Paxton carries the movie almost entirely by herself and gives one of the best performances I have seen in any movie in years.This comes right after seeing her in Shark Night, a decent movie which is improved by her presence alone.From now on I will look forward to any movies that Ti West or Sarah Paxton do.The Innkeepers is brilliant."
B006RECSBC Ti West's \"The Innkeepers\" is a tour de force, certainly superior to his debut \"House of the Devil\".  It seems to be a bit under appreciated judging by both the comments here and it's critical reception.  I'm not sure why.  It is a bit like peeling an onion but once you do, you don't cry--you scream.  This is psychological terror at it's most refined and disturbing.Sara Paxton plays Claire, a twenty something working at a reputedly haunted hotel just about to close.  Pat Healy plays the distant and sort of strange Luke, a middle aged man who also works the desk and claims to be interested in using EVP to uncover the hotel's infamous ghost, Madelin O Malley.  Madelin was stiffed on her wedding night, killed herself, and her body was stuffed in the trunk of the hotel's basement.For the first half hour of the film, none of this is given what one would call serious treatment.  Claire and Luke goof around, gossip about the famous aged actress played by Kelly McGillis, and it isn't until Claire begins to take the EVP quest seriously that it gets serious.This may lead the viewer to conclude the tragic ending of the film to be a consequence of Claire's overactive imagination or her asthma.  There are a few other things to consider, though.  Why does Lee, McGillis' character, arrive at night just before things get ghostly?  Why, before urging Claire to leave, does Luke say \"I have something to tell you\"?  Was his skepticism a mere front for something else he knew?  Why does Lee's facial profile look so much more youthful the last time we see her?Without giving anything away, it seems to me this is an infinitely more complex movie than most seem to realize.  Absolutely recommended for lovers of horror.  Watch carefully."
B006RECSBC By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MSThe Innkeepers is not a typical horror film, and I've got to believe that's the reason it's got a 76% rating at Rotten Tomatoes.Two employees, Claire (Sara Paxton) and Luke (Pat Healy) remain at the Yankee Pedlar Inn. The quaint hotel has fallen on hard times and is about to close. The two spend their remaining time making fun of any last minute guests and work to uncover proof that the old inn is haunted.The ghost is Madeline O'Malley. The story is supposedly true. Philadelphian businessman Thaddeus O'Malley courted her, and they were soon wed. The Yankee Pedlar was to be the location of their honeymoon.Just after the wedding, Thaddeus got word that there was a problem with the sale of a coal mine in upstate Pennsylvania and that he must come immediately. He sends Madeline, alone, ahead of him to The Yankee Pedlar. There's an accident at the mine which claims Thaddeus' life. He didn't change his will, so Madeline would go from rich to penniless. She hung herself. Thus a haunted inn where Madeline roams the halls, plays the piano, etc.What makes The Innkeepers different, is there is little gore. It lumbers along telling the story while introducing the two other guests, Leanne Rease-Jones (Kelly McGillis) a television has-been turned psychic, and an old man (George Riddle) who says he's come back to stay in the room where he and his late wife celebrated their honeymoon.Slow moving but worth a look."
B006RECSBC An entertaining dynamic between two awkwardly sweet characters steer this film into a unique mood.  I really enjoyed watching this movie and it made for a very different, satisfying experience.Claire (Sara Paxton) and Luke (Pat Healy) work at the Yankee Pedlar Inn and are determined to find evidence of the paranormal within its walls before it goes out of business in its final days.  They have a refreshingly platonic friendship that isn't blurred by the typical nudity-harbingering sexual tension so common among horror ilk.  These two have a natural and playful chemistry; you instantly know that they care about each other and, in effect, it makes viewers care about them.  Already this is a solid victory for any horror movie.Claire is a somewhat awkward but super-nice young woman with a childish verve who finds listening to others to be exhausting, instantly slouching like a dropped marionette.  Luke is a nice, quirky guy who likes getting to know the hotel guests.  Their dynamic is nothing short of cute and it comes with some funny accidental scares.  The director clearly went out of his way to make Paxton look childishly cute whenever possible.  The characters were so well written that I could seriously watch this movie as a dramedy without any horror elements, just to watch Luke and Claire's interactions.  It's all done very well and they're so likeable.They want to find proof of Madeleine O'Malley's haunting.  During the process Claire starts hearing things and some cheap scares really made me smile.  Claire does an overnight ghost recording and picks up on something spooky.TV star Lee Jones (Kelly McGillis) is in town for a convention.  She is a bit distant, in a superior way, but subtly maternal.  She offers her spiritual knowledge and turns out to be a medium.  Some limited communication with \"the other side\" reveals a room in the hotel where something awful happened that Claire must not enter because she \"cannot save\" Madeleine.  The tone shifts from light-hearted to serious as the style of the scares follows suit.  Stranger, graver things start happening involving the hotel guests and further investigations by Claire and Luke.The scares seem simple--like they're meant not to be terrifying, but only jumpy--as if this was made so that preteens could have a \"good\" horror movie that won't leave them traumatized.  This is still enjoyable to adults, though.  There's no creepy, dreadful vibe whatsoever.  It's more like you look forward to things, like with a good mystery novel, than dread them.  \"Spooky\" elements are simply clich&eacute;s executing perfectly; as if this movie was a \"how to\" manual for future horror filmmakers.The camerawork was good; simple, but well-placed and effective.  The movie demanded no more than they gave.Let's be clear.  The horror \"story\" wasn't very good. While I loved the character-driven premise and it carried the movie effortlessly, the horror story itself never really felt like it moved forward and it certainly met us with no resolution at the end whatsoever.  However, I really enjoyed watching this movie and it made for a very different, satisfying experience."
B006RECSBC The Innkeepers is a creepy haunted hotel film. Basically, Claire and Luke work at a hotel that's about to close and they want to prove it's haunted. Madeline O'Malley is the ghost and her design is amazing (the scene in the bedroom gave me chills!). The acting was fine and I actually liked both of the main characters. The comedy bits were also a nice addition (not a horror/comedy though). The music was also well done. It's a slow-burning type of movie; the movie generally moves at a slow pace.The tension it builds works for and against the film. Sometimes, the tension would be dreadful and lead to something terrifying. Other times, the tension would be too long and lead to a weak scare or nothing at all. Which leads to another point, it's not as scary as it could've been. The scares are limited for a 1hr 40min film. The slow pace may also make some people slowly drift away; I'm personally a fan of all horror, especially slow horror though.There is some blood and frightening sequences, no sex or nudity so it's tamed compared to other modern horror films. Definitely recommend to any fans of slow horror."
B006RECSBC Too slow-moving when the climax is there it couldn't get there soon enough and naturally predictable.Boring at times,and when the \"Horror\" did come it was gross in an bad and distasteful.The movie is more of an thriller than an horror movie,Glad I watched it on Netflix instant first than renting it or owning it.Not enough scares to be scary and not interesting enough for me to watch again."
B006RECSBC While I appreciated the generally positive reception Ti West's \"The Innkeepers\" received upon its theatrical run, I fear it may have been oversold as a fright fest. This is a small, but very appealing, piece set in a haunted New England inn that scores more from its human interactions than it does from its supernatural leanings. And that's just fine. If you're anticipating big scares and lots of horror mayhem, though, this may not be the film for you. Its charms are far more subtle and unexpected. In truth, I quite loved this movie. It has modest goals and, by keeping things intimate, succeeds quite admirably in feeling fresh and real. West keeps the effects to a minimum and allows the movie to come alive in the hands of his engaging cast. It's a wise decision as the screenplay is tart and funny and the actors are committed and enthusiastic.Sara Paxton and Pat Healy play hotel clerks spending one last weekend in the historic The Yankee Pedlar Inn before it closes down for good. The rooms are mostly vacant, so the pair of amateur ghost hunters plan to use the opportunity to get physical recordings of its alleged haunting. Most of the film relies on the easy chemistry and camaraderie of Healy and Paxton and they play off each other well. Seriously, I laughed constantly throughout the film--especially due to Paxton's deft performance. Only three rooms have occupants for all or part of the weekend. They contend with a mysterious man with history in the hotel, a wayward wife and her child, and a fading actress (and spiritualist). As the hours progress, Paxton seems to be getting closer to uncovering real spirits. What begins as a lark may be headed for a more serious conclusion.I wasn't particularly familiar with or a fan of Sara Paxton (her resume is populated by such fare as Shark Night 3-D and Lifetime Network's Blue Eyed Butcher), but this is a star making turn. She is so likable and so funny, I was more than willing to go on this adventure with her. Healy is also quite effective. Kelly McGillis (Top Gun, Witness) has one of her best roles in years as the actress. I loved every scene she and Paxton shared. The film ratchets up the tension as it pushes forward, but never attempts to overcomplicate or over-explain things. In the end, it may all be a bit vague in mythology. But truthfully, I didn't care. I so liked the cast and the movie had been so entertaining, I went with the ending even if it seemed a bit tidy (or maybe messy, I'm not sure). Again, this isn't about big scares or horrifying moments. It is largely about what is unseen and how real people react in creepy settings. \"The Innkeepers\" isn't revolutionary, perhaps, but it is funny and engaging. And I've become a huge Paxton fan! KGHarris, 4/12."
B006RECSBC After waiting nearly two years, Ti West's follow-up to his critically acclaimed genre masterpiece, \"The House of the Devil\", is finally here. Giddy with excitement like a child ready to rip open his biggest Christmas present, my expectations were sky high. The movie just had to be a masterpiece, it had to be a unique, one-of-a-kind thriller, and it had to be perfect. I am one of the horror faithfuls that believes that \"House of the Devil\" is THE best horror movie of the last decade and this movie had better come close to that sort of greatness. Does \"The Innkeepers\" reach those lofty heights or does it vanish into thin air like the ghosts it portrays?\"The Innkeepers\" tells the story of The Yankee Pedlar Inn. After over one hundred years of service, The Yankee Pedlar Inn is shutting its doors for good. The last remaining employees -Claire (Sara Paxton) and Luke (Pat Healy) - are determined to uncover proof of what many believe to be one of New England's most haunted hotels. As the Inns final days draw near, odd guests check in as the pair of minimum wage ghosthunters begin to experience strange and alarming events that may ultimately cause them to be mere footnotes in the hotels long unexplained history. Along with them for the ride is a actress turned psychic who may know more than she lets on and an old man who will stay in nothing less than the Honeymoon Suite and may have a connection the a devastating murder that took place years before.\"The Innkeepers\" is terrifically moody with some of the best cinematography I've seen in a movie in a long time. The Inn comes alive in a fresh way that never feels phony or cheap. The actors are also quite good, particularly Paxton as Claire who is headstrong and determined but also has a shy, vulnerable side. The being said, the movie is a lot a buildup for a conclusion that seems fairly ho-hum. I know people bashed HOTD for the same thing but the ending here seems both too delayed as well as rushed, if such a thing is possible. It all just plays kind of false and lessens the stylish chills of the film's first two acts. I don't want it to seem as if I didn't enjoy this movie. I liked it, in fact I liked it a lot. Maybe it was my fault holding this film up to an impossible standard that no film could possibly live up to. HOTD was a masterpiece, this one is a pretty good thriller. Nonetheless, in today's horror market, pretty good is definitely good enough. Just keep your expectations in check. 3.5 out of 5"
B006RECSBC \"You're just impatient! Ti West is a master at creating atmosphere! If you didn't like this movie, I'm sure Joel Schumacher will make a loud, angry horror movie one of these days! This is for TRUE fans of horror!\"These are just a few of the retorts you hear from fans when you complain about West's slow-burn spookiness. I will grant, as others have done, that West does excellent work with a camera -- he frames and tracks some really sumptuous shots -- but atmosphere is no substitute for a story. I don't watch movies for atmosphere. That's why I buy lounge music, or candles, or fake cobwebs in October. If atmosphere is all a movie has going for it, then it's no better than one of those looped images of flickering fireplaces you can pop on the TV during Christmas.So what about the story? Isn't it scary? Nope. Two twenty-somethings -- Claire and Luke -- are the only staff members at the soon-to-close Yankee Pedlar Inn. With cheeky self-consciousness, they spend their many hours of free time searching the old hotel for one of the ghosts that is said to reside there. It's a fairly standard ghost story trope, and the addition of a psychic who has \"reverse deja vu\" does little to twist the story into something intriguing or new. There is, essentially, no story, which was a similar flaw in the nearly identical West film, The House of the Devil (girl left alone for a long time, strange goings-on, some people are not who they claim to be, incredibly slow atmospheric build to a cheap-show ten minute conclusion of sloppily written \"chills\").So the story sucks. Movies can still succeed by virtue of the characters alone, even if the plot is confusing or sloppy. Unfortunately, Luke and Claire, while well-acted and realistic enough, are not interesting characters. They speak with the kind of canned dialogue that screenwriters pen when they aren't sure what's supposed to happen next in the film. Sara Paxton tries desperately to make Claire appear as cute as she can in every scene; she looks like she took acting lessons from a newborn puppy. On the very, very few moments when the movie lets the viewers glimpse something creepy, the effect is numbed by Claire's mopey mugging.I'm certain it's meant to be funny, as it is often accompanied by hokey sitcom music. West seems to be as confused by comedy as he is by horror, though. The movie thinks things are funny -- a girl in her underwear runs by a small boy! it takes Claire five minutes to take out the trash! the coffee girl is socially awkward! -- but even if they were, they contribute nothing to the story or the characters. All in all, it's like watching two boring people making a movie about themselves being boring. Dull characters who are authentically acted are still dull.West obviously has an eye for making movies but not for telling stories. He tries too hard to be subtle and artistic. An excellent example is the final shot of the film. My friends did not understand why the camera held for so long on the final shot, but I saw what all of them missed. I won't tell you what it is, but I will say this: if you don't know it's there, it's almost impossible to see it. I only noticed the subtle little parting shot that West included in the scene because I read a review, like this one, telling me to look for it. And that's the thing: if your artistry is so subtle, so careful, so minute as to escape the notice of nearly every single viewer of your film, then maybe you're focused too much on the background stuff (like West's highly touted skill at creating atmosphere) and not enough on the actual meat of your movie (characters, story, conflict).Dialogue that treads water. Dull and annoying characters. Almost no story to speak of. Cliched plot. More than your average number of fake scares (I counted three before the first fifteen minutes). Unsatisfying climax and conclusion."
B006RECSBC I was watching a documentary on horror films in the U.S. the other day and while I watched I realized something. There were actually few if any true horror films are being made these days. Granted there are films made that qualify for the genre, but most are more obsessed these days with how far they can push the envelope, how much gore they can include and how disgusting they can make the world seem. Far too many have chosen to go the Rob Zombie route of showing us homes in decay where dirt is far more common than cleanliness. I for one would find it more terrifying to see a serial killer in a well kept home than the unwashed, unbathed louts living in trailer parks more frequently seen today. Then I watched THE INNKEEPERS.The Yankee Pedlar Inn was founded in 1891 and has seen better days. The last weekend the hotel is to be open two clerks are working taking care of just three customers. Claire (Sara Paxton) is an early twenty something working at the inn with no outlook on her future. Luke (Pat Healy) is a laid back older guy who lives at home with his mother and has no future prospects as well. The pair has formed a friendship while working at the Inn and share an interest in the history of the locale as well. Said to be haunted, Luke has set up a web site based in incidents that he has recorded while working there.On this, the last weekend, the pair hopes to finally catch something worthwhile to include on the site, a real paranormal happening that can be verified with two people on hand. Checking into the hotel we find a young mother and her son, staying to avoid her possibly soon to be ex-husband. Later we have a movie star who's seen better days, Leanne Rease-Jones (Kelly McGillis), here to speak at a convention nearby. Lastly we have an elderly man (George Riddle) checking in to recall the good old days when he came here on his wedding night. But the guests are secondary for the most part though they play important roles as the film winds down. It is the spirits and the search for them that make up the scares here.Claire and Luke take turns watching the desk and taking care of the needs of their customers. When not working, they sleep or attempt to record EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomenon), recordings of spiritual voices in the room unable to be heard by the human ear. During the times when Claire searches for signs of the afterlife more happens than with Luke. It seems as if the spirits are trying to reach Claire for some reason.Star struck by Leanne, Claire displays the usual fan klutz attitude. But later the two have the opportunity to talk. It turns out Leanne isn't in town to speak at an acting class or fan fair but to speak about her newest calling, healing via crystals and the like. Assuming the role of medium, she tries to help Claire with the search for the main spirit in the hotel, one Madeline O'Malley. Murdered and her body hidden in the cellar for 3 days by the owners of the hotel at that time to avoid bad publicity, it is said that Madeline continues to walk the halls of the hotel. In attempting to contact her, Leanne offers sound advice to Claire: don't go in the basement. Any guess as to where Claire goes?Between bumps in the night, a piano that plays itself and several other scares the film does indeed offer some truly frightening moments as it plays out. The first third of the film offers little in the way of horror with the exception of a few jump moments, scenes where things make loud noises causing the viewer to jump. But as it progresses it tells a tale that evokes some haunting images and a story that slowly unfolds to bring about real scares.The acting is wonderful here, especially from the two leads. They don't appear to be actors at all but two people who work at the most boring of jobs, leading boring lives in search of something else outside of their own level of comfort. When the world they seek appears to be coming alive, their terror seems real as well.The movie is slow paced but wonderfully so, never rushing to get us somewhere but letting us take in the whole view of the hotel and its history given in bits and pieces. The need for gore is absent and that makes the scares even more disturbing. Horror films that allow you brain to fill in the gaps make for much scarier viewing than simple effects. This film offers the thrill of the old horror film and that's something it should be proud of. If you want to see how a horror film can be done right, then by all means check this one out."
B006RECSBC and that's something most people have forgotten how to use when watching a movie.As in my previous movie review about \"John Dies At the End\" this movie is a perfect example of what I mean when I say people don't like to think when they watch a movie anymore. This film was absolutely amazing for a ghost story and about as real as you can expect in this genre. An old hotel where a death occurred and two hotel workers just trying to put in their days work, loathing the decisions they made in life that made them hotel clerks, and just trying to find something more for themselves aside from their boring jobs. Luke works on his ghost hunting website and Claire is writing a book. To keep themselves entertained they depend on each other and have a strong friendship. Claire likes to support Luke and finds ghost hunting a fun way to spend her long work hours. It's not until strange things start happening that things change for the both of them. This movie has questions but ALL of the answers are given in the story. This movie requires attention be paid to detail and the characters dialogue. Even the ending scene holds a clue to the fate of the main character. EVERYTHING is in the film and that's what makes it so freaking brilliant!To persons that weren't listening,paying attention, or trying to piece together the clues and hints, all they can say is \"It was slow,it was boring,this is a bad horror film,it made me think and my brain hurts,I didn't get it what happened?\". This movie has so many elements to it you really need to PAY ATTENTION.So here it comes \"The story\" and yes there will be *Spoilers!*The Yankee Peddler Hotel is closing down. It's the last weekend of the hotel being opened. It's also the last time Luke and Claire get to find out if there is really a ghost or not in the hotel. It would be a real accomplishment for either of them as neither of them have accomplished anything truly amazing in their lives. It be their own personal victory to finally achieve something in the time they spent at the hotel. Finding the ghostly Bride is the perfect going away present for them. In the last days of the hotel Claire befriends an ex actress/psychic that gives her a small bit of assistance about the ghost of the hotel. The Psychic tells Claire to stay away from the basement and that there are 3 spirits in the hotel. Claire is clueless as to who they are but the psychic can sense it faintly. After some strange events occur on the last night Claire and Luke decide to kick up their ghost hunting game and venture into the basement to connect with the ghost. Low and behold they get what they asks for. Claire can sense the ghost because she is sensitive just like the Psychic ex actress. Except she can see them but she can't tell the future or predict events. For some reason these spirits are attracted to Claire and it's because they are sensitive to her. To Luke he doesn't see or hear the ghosts but the Claire she can. It's the time she spends with the Psychic that stimulates this ability in her. Before she was able to see the ghost she was able to sense then mildly or experience phenomenon where she heard them (like being attracted to the basement and the piano).The spirits were attracted to her energy. Towards the end of the film when Claire becomes more sensitive she is able to hear the ghost and begins following her voice thinking it's the Psychic. Claire finds herself in the basement where she was warned not to go. As she is sensitive to ghost the spirit of the \"Old Man\" finds his way to her energy and Claire being frighting falls down the stairs and hits her head. When she regains herself she sees is aware that the ghostly presence of the old man is following her. Clair runs to the back exit of the basement and closes the door behind her. The door starts moving and she hears banging and is even more frightened and the last thing she sees is the Ghost Bride before her and she blacks out and dies of an asthma attack. The 3 ghosts that the Psychic saw in the basement were The ghost bride,the old man, and Claire herself. Although the psychic said she see's events sometimes not as they are now but in the future. Her vision was of Claire's demise. In the final ending scene at the window we faintly see Claire standing looking out the window then the door slams shut. In reality the knocking and pounding Claire heard at the door was Luke trying to rescue her after he heard her screaming. Luke did not see the ghost or feel them because he was not a sensitive like Claire was. To him the basement was just a basement. There was no spirit of an old man or a bride there. To Claire who was sensitive she could hear and see them and they were attracted to her for that reason. Although the only thing that is never explained is what the ghost want from Claire and the Phsychic ex Actress never mentions anything about it as she is stunned by what she sees will happen in the basement with Claire's death.The Innkeeper's is a great movie with a very sad ending. It can be a reward for those that pay attention or a just a waste of time for those that weren't. This isn't exactly an upbeat film but a film that tries to add a bit of realism by creating realistic characters and more believable story instead of just bumps in the knight. In a way it's almost like some of the audience is Luke who doesn't see anything special or feel anything special from the movie and the rest of the audience is Claire that sees all these things going on and take in what's happening."
B006RECSBC I finally watched this on Netflix this morning and loved it. It's not some big budget scare fest but the certain scenes they did show were scary and I loved that old inn a lot. I think it was the inn and the quirky girl innkeeper that won me over. I'm gonna buy it from Amazon now for a great blu ray price."
B006RECSBC Ti West's THE INNKEEPERS is an atmospheric ghost story, relying on character and low-key shocks.  While I agree with fellow reviewers on the refreshing absence of gore and CGI effects, I find West's movies too formulaic and slow-paced.  INNKEEPERS seems padded and derivative---there's little we haven't seen before, and may seem more original only in comparison to today's more graphic, blood-heavy alternatives.Sarah Paxton (SHARK NIGHT 3D, ENTER NOWHERE) offers an inconsistent performance as the affectatious Claire.  She plays coy and naivete well, but exaggerates many gestures and expressions in her more dramatic scenes.  Pat Healy as Luke is too one-toned to incite any empathy.  TOP GUN's Kelly McGillis takes acting honors as the fading psychic actress, bringing a certain maturity to the film.The script itself is fairly predictable with a clumsy conclusion.  The violin-laden score is appropriately chilling.THE INNKEEPERS is a nice change of pace, b
B006RECSBC My first relevant question would  be - how old was the person who wrote this?My guess would be somewhere around 12.Good ghost films are rare to be sure, and some make a reasonable effort.This one does not."
B006RECSBC The script and dialogue had a cleverness that keep ones intrigue.  Character development was good and should not be overlooked.  Not a horror-teenfest by any means, but just a semi-creepy story that actually does not have super-cliqued ending that I would not ultimately have guessed."
B006RECSBC The Innkeepers (Ti West, 2011)Pretty much everyone I know with whom I have discussed The Innkeepers considers it a better movie than Ti West's previous one, The House of the Devil, and one of the reasons I have held off on reviewing it for as long as I have&#8212;I actually watched it for the first time well over a year ago as I write this opening paragraph&#8212;is that after I watched it, I vehemently disagreed. Nothing has happened in the ensuing fifteen months, including rewatching sections of the movie, sometimes obsessively, and discussing it to death with a few folks to try and get what it was I'm missing, but nothing has managed to sway me from my conviction that The House of the Devil is, quite simply, a much better-made film that is more successful at tapping into the homage it's going for than is The Innkeepers. Which is not, I should rush to add (but, curiously, I have not) to say that The Innkeepers is in any way not good. It is still, compared to most recent Hollywood horror fare, head and shoulders above anything else from a major studio you are likely to see within the next year, unless of course Ti West releases something (and doesn't suddenly revert to the guy who made such awful movies as The Roost).Plot: Claire (The Last House on the Left's Sara Paxton) and Luke (Rescue Dawn's Pat Healy) are the last two employees left working at a hotel that is slated for demolition, and all they have to do is get through their last weekend of unremitting boredom, go home, and then forget this place ever existed, right? Well, maybe not. They've never been swamped with customers, but for some reason, there's a steady stream of them this weekend. Well, a trickle, at least. More than usual. And some of them start reporting weird occurrences on the upper floors, leading to the conclusion that, perhaps, this won't be a boring weekend after all; Luke has long been researching the hotel's supposedly haunted past, and Sara finds herself reluctantly drawn into his obsession. But one of the cardinal rules of dealing with haunted places: you don't ever want to try to get the ghosts to talk to you...It's a fun little movie with a killer cast (Kelly McGillis, John Speredakos, Alison Bartlett O'Reilly, etc.) that spends much of its time suggesting, rather than showing, what's going on, and on that level, it succeeds just as well as its predecessor. But I mentioned the homage factor. I kind of have to dance around it here because saying what specific movie it pays homage to would give the entire final sequence away (but if you've got any exposure to the history of horror film, you'll know it the second you see it), but (a) it is obvious that West is once again paying homage here, and once you've seen the final sequence, going back and rewatching certain key scenes will show you it's not limited to the end of the movie, and (b) it's still a glancing blow, as opposed to the bullseye that was The House of the Devil vs. every Satanic Panic movie of the seventies (though if you want a specific movie, the one that always goes most through my head where The House of the Devil is concerned is The Night God Screamed, but kind of in reverse). Because of that, I think, that final sequence, and the denouement that follows it, got robbed of a lot of their power. (And oh, for the love of The Hills Have Eyes, did we really need that final shot? In case you're wondering, Magic 8-ball says &#8220;NO.&#8221;) Still, it's a great deal of fun; just remind yourself that the draggy sections are there for a reason. *** "
B006RECSBC Another nicely done creep fest that I missed in theaters last February, when it was given a limited theatrical run. The Inkeepers, now out on DVD and blu-ray from Dark Sky films, it combines elements of a 90's slacker comedy with a haunted house story. Starting out as a character piece and slowly descending into horror. This is a little more thoughtful than a lot of terror flicks, more leisurely paced, but all the richer for it.Written, directed and edited by Ti West, who previously directed the excellent old school shocker The House of the Devil (2010). This well written and often very funny movie has two twenty-something , the inkeepers of the title, working in an old hotel with minimal guests on the last week before they are closed and subsequently demolished. They are highly susceptible asthmatic Claire (Sara Paxton) and the slightly older Luke (Pat Healy), who have been tracking a ghost who is said to dwell in the hotel, for sometime on their live internet feed. Not much has happened, so far, so Claire decides to help the proceedings along a bit by trying to make contact with the help of a psychic and former TV sitcom star (played by 80's movie star Kelly McGillis) staying at the hotel.The movie works best when it is focusing on the two amiable main characters and there very humorous interactions. Not so much when the film takes a turn towards horror, but at least it is never graphic enough to completely spoil the feel of the earlier scenes. The ghosts are not well developed, we learn next to nothing about them, which frustrated me a bit. This isn't great, but better than a lot of recent chillers, but I still would have preferred anedy old school indie comedy over the admittedly limited spilled bloodcheck out my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com"
B006RECSBC Wow, what a boring movie, the cover had all these great reviews of how fantastic this movie is and that it's the best horror film of the year, what a let down, kept waiting for the horror to come, it didn't, my wife fell asleep it was the interesting, the characters were fine and the acting good, but the story was just not up to par, could not consider this movie as anything but a waste of time, sorry I bought it and paid full price, trying to hard, special effects were nothing special, no scares, they say old time creepy, not really, the old time horror movies that relied on atmosphere and story development are nothing like this movie, don't waste your time, though the movie might bore you to death."
B006RECSBC I find myself a bit torn in my opinion of The Innkeepers.  There's a lot to enjoy but there's also a fair amount to dislike about the film.  Director Ti West's story about an aging New England Inn in its final week of operation has a tone unlike most horror films.  There are a lot of elements that don't seem on the surface like they would mix together well, but the enjoyable cast makes the film eminently watchable.Claire (Paxton) and Luke (Healey) are a couple of twenty-something loafers who work at the Yankee Pedlar, a New England inn that is over a hundred years old.  With the owner on vacation, Claire and Luke are the only employees still working at the near-empty inn during its final week of operation.  With few guests to attend, and having to work 12 hour shifts the pair do what they can to amuse themselves and pass the time.  Fancying themselves amateur ghost hunters, they've setup a website to explore the legend of the Yankee Pedlar which is allegedly haunted by the spirit of a Madeline O'Malley, a woman who hung herself on her wedding day when her fianc&eacute; jilted her.As mentioned, The Innkeepers has a strange vibe to it.  The early part of the film has a good deal of comedy as the pair of Luke and Claire engage in various pursuits just to get through the day including drinking beer at the front counter, telling ghost stories to the young son of an annoying guest, just to get under her skin, and dealing with the wacky counterperson at the nearby coffee shop.  This, along with a slow pace doesn't fit with what you expect out of a horror film.  The tone changes abruptly with the arrival of Leanne Reese-Jones (McGillis) a former actress turned psychic.As Claire explores the inn at night with recording equipment, looking to pickup some EVP (electronic voice phenomena) she encounters voices whispering within the walls and the playing of a piano in the front lobby.  A terrified Claire runs to Leanne for help.  The psychic uses her ability to channel the spirits in the inn and warns Claire to stay clear of the basement.  The arrival of an elderly guest who wants to spend one last night in the honeymoon suite completes the transition from slacker comedy to full-on horror culminating with Claire's terrifying encounter with the inn's spirits.I suppose it depends on your outlook as to whether The Innkeeper's faults can be overlooked due to its positives or if it's positives are neutralized by the faults.  West's slow burn of a film develops the characters of Claire and Luke to the point where you can certainly relate to them.  The pair apparently have no prospects once the inn closes.  Claire's redoubtable spunkiness drives much of the action.  Last seen in the horrible film \"Shark Night\", Paxton appears here, sans tiny bikini and without make-up in a huge contrast from that film. There's a brilliantly funny scene as she is trying to open a dumpster lid with one hand and toss in a leaky plastic trash bag for the other...that is just a little too heavy for her to lift with a single hand and avoid whatever noxious contents are spilling out of the bag.  The dialog sparkles with a casual wit.  You feel like you're eavesdropping on a couple of real people when they are talking.But The Innkeepers has a major Achilles heel.  Too many questions are left unanswered at the film's conclusion; so many, in fact, that I found myself re-watching scenes to see if I missed the \"Shamalayan\" moment.  What did Leanne really see when she channeled the spirits?  And what was with her strange staring out of her room's window at the end?  For all of the development of the two leads, West is woefully short on any exposition when it comes to the spirits.  What are their motivations?  Why are they after Claire?  Why was it that Leanne's arrival seemed to have triggered the spirit's activity?  These issues prevent The Innkeepers from having the clean ending that most viewers desire.  But maybe that's what West was going for all along.Blu-Ray ExtrasTwo Audio commentaries: One with Writer/director/editor Ti West, producers Peter Phok & Larry Fessenden, and second unit director/sound designer Graham Reznick; and the second with Ti West and stars Sara Paxton & Pat Healy.Behinds the Scenes Featurette"
B006RECSBC I was looking for a good horror movie, that fell under the radar, to promote for halloween, and I was told that the Innkeepers was that film, but it wasn't. This film is so clique, stealing almost everything from other films of the same genre. They had the nerve to give this movie an R rating and call it the must see horror movie of the year, but truthfully, its slightly more scary than a Disney movie! An old hotel is going out of business and the two remaining employees decide to investigate the long history of ghost sightings at the establishment. There are only a couple guests, giving them the perfect opportunity to investigate. The only thing this film uses in order to frighten you is random things jumping out at you, which most of the time aren't what you expect them to be. There is also a creepy old woman staying there who can talk to the spirits and predict the future, but if that isn't bad enough, there is of course the investigations themselves. Using nothing but a s***ty old tape recorder, they go looking for EVPs, using every phrase and question they could steal from Ghost Hunters. Yeah, the Innkeepers really is that ridiculous and the only really shocking thing about this movie is that someone actually gave it an R rating! Was the MPAA associate a little girl or elderly woman, because honestly, Monster House was scarier than this thing was."
B006RECSBC \"This weekend's gonna be it. We're gonna get something good, I can feelit.\" During the final week at the Yankee Pedlar Inn the remainingemployees Claire (Paxton and Luke are determined to find out if thehotel is haunted. When events begin to happen that make them feel theyare right the two employees get more then they asked for. I have neverreally been a big horror movie fan. The ones I do like are the morepsychological ones with an actual story to them. I like the \"Saw\"series, but most of the \"torture-porn\" to me is not horror. All thatsaid I liked this movie. While this is not a typical horror and is nota fast moving movie at all it is still good enough to keep youwatching. For a lower budget movie the acting is actually really goodand there are scenes that will make you tense b
B006RECSBC A historic inn is closing after many years, closing not only a connection to the past but also a connection to what happened in the basement. There is a legend about a death and about a body, and it leads to stories told by patrons and staff alike. The two people on-shift have taken note of it too, one going as far as to make a website of his encounter and the other just wanting to look around. what begins as fun at closing time starts to slide into contact, and contact leads to more as the inn slides toward being forgotten.I'll be honest, I had high hopes for this film and actually picked it up after seeing some solid reviews.  for some reason, slow building horror movies seem to make a dent with people who lean toward more mainstream films, and that is alright. If that includes your forays into horror and suspense, this might even be something for you. I liked parts of it, and might have liked it more if something would have happened to keep me going. You had a lot of moments that went up in tempo, getting the music playing and the thrills kicking, and you had things that manifested here and there that seemed to say escalation was in order. In fact, it kept on doing that while trying to stay tense but it all felt hollow after a while, like there should have been a few less false alarms and more contact.Basically, I felt like you had an interesting start, some spooky \"did you hear that\" moments, a nice payout toward the end with minimal effects and a \"its there\" without the audience seeing it approach to haunting, and an decently interesting end you could see coming. The issue I had was the how long a lot of this took and how redundant revisiting a psychic or watching someone try to find what is making that sound can become. Removing the end because it should always have some payout, a few EVP moments done by not one but two people, a few doors closing and many false alarms, and a strange old man do not making a haunting. It did have some eerie moments and it had all the elements, but just felt like it felt incomplete.to me, the Innkeepers felt like a promise being made and never delivered. That's why I'm going 3/5, saying it was ok, but it should have been better."
B006RECSBC It seems like every few years there is a new \"hot\" horror director who everybody thinks has found the magic formula, bringing the same level of thrills as the classics but doing it in a fresh new way. Most of these filmmakers fade away into straight-to-DVD land or into making survival horror video games. It's a hard genre to crack, but occasionally one director appears and proves he's truly worth keeping a close watch on. Although he's been around for years, Ti West's biggest break came with 2009's creepily retro The House of the Devil, which was so good a number of critics had it in their top 10 of the year. When was the last time that happened? His follow-up, The Innkeepers, is similar in that it's a twist on a familiar theme, that of the \"haunted hotel\". Even more, it shows that West isn't content to indulge in the gruesome, or fall back on lame jump cuts for cheap scares. Instead he relies on good old fashioned tension building and humor to make for a moody, effective thriller.The Yankee Pedlar has seen better days. The old hotel is creaking to it's final weekend before being turned into a parking lot. The place is basically abandoned, with even the owner not caring enough to stick around. Even his choice in who will manage the place to it's inevitable fate shows how little concern there is for the old, supposedly haunted building. Claire(Sara Paxton), a perky, asthmatic cherub with a runaway imagination; and Luke(Pat Healy), a smart mouthed wannabe ghost hunter struggle to even keep towels handy for the few remaining guests.  One of those is Leanne Rease-Jones(an unrecognizable Kelly McGillis) a former actress turned psychic/soothsayer, who puffs her cigarette and fingers her power crystal between disapproving glares at Claire.West structures his film in three short chapters, and those who are used to a constant barrage of loud \"booms\" and crashing piano keys might want to go home and watch their copy of The Grudge. The West has the feel of an old TV horror anthology, or an episode of The Twilight Zone. It relies mainly on atmosphere, and giving us a peek inside the minds of the characters we'll be terrified for later. In this case, boredom and idleness have taken over Claire and Luke's brains, with the emptiness of the building not helping the situation. Luke has put together an upstart website focusing on the paranormal, and Claire has become obsessed with the story of a woman who was left for dead in the basement and continues to haunt the hotel. While a little meandering, these first two chapters never fail to be attention grabbing, with West's script keeping the tone light,  the casual banter between Paxton and Healy often hilarious and even a little flirty. Well, as flirty as it gets for two such social outcasts. He clearly has a thing for her, but she's way too spacey to notice or care.There's a very thin line between comedy and terror when it comes to genre flicks like this, and West walks that tightrope with ease. His use of humor might seem out of place, especially for such an extended period of time, but by the time the final chapter rolls around you realize it was all done for a purpose. Your defenses lowered and all too relaxed, the genuine scares of the final chapter hit you like a sucker punch to the gut. West sets us up perfectly, with some fantastic camerawork, from long tracking hallway shots to some brilliant use of angles to keep us totally in the dark. Even when the film appears to be drifting along, there's a foreboding air just beneath the surface. When Luke starts warning Claire about the dangers of chasing ghosts, that she'll start to become paranoid, we know it won't be long before that very thing happens. But what fun it is to watch as it does!The best horror filmmakers are masters at playing all of the audiences emotions to maximum effect, and after only a handful of films, Ti West has proven himself to be one who can."
B006RECSBC Ti West's The Innkeepers (2011) spends most of its time in a small inn, immersing you in a strange reality where the emphasis is on the paranormal.  This slow burn is mostly atmospheric, as not a great deal seems to happen, but if you stick with it, you may be in a receptive frame of mind, for the unsettling conclusion.With a somewhat notorious history, the Yankee Pedlar Inn is about to close.  The establishment is supposedly haunted by the ghost of Madeline O'Malley, a woman who killed herself in the inn, after being abandoned by her husband.  While the owner is away, employees Luke (Pat Healy) and Claire (Sara Paxton) make up the entire staff for the last few days.  With not much to do, these ghost hunter wannabes pass their time looking for evidence of Madeline's presence.  The inn is nearly empty, with actress turned medium Leanne Rease-Jones (Kelly McGillis), being one of the final guests.Claire is the more active ghost hunter, and she confides in Rease-Jones after a spooked Luke flees from the inn.  With some psychic ability, Leanne is able to offer some assistance, as she and Claire venture into the basement, where the ghost is supposed to dwell.  Leanne advises Claire that they need to leave immediately.  Claire attempts to clear out the last of the guests, but discovers that he has already checked out.  Back in the lobby, she finds that Luke has returned, but Leanne is now absent.  The end is near, but will they all survive?The Innkeepers moves at a leisurely pace.  Claire and Luke have so little to do, that even providing fresh towels is a major undertaking.  Mostly free to do as they wish, and seemingly fascinated by ghosts and the paranormal, we come to know them as two different varieties of geek.  Claire is hyper, goofy, clumsy, and often behaves like a child.  Luke has a hairdo like Tin Tin, is something of a cynic, and acts like Claire's smartass older brother, although he is actually attracted to her.  Healy and Paxton bring a quirkiness to their roles, which makes them mostly amusing to watch.  Her role as a medium may be something of a clich&eacute;, but even with limited screen time Kelly McGillis manages to bring some credibility to it.With such a substantial buildup, you fully expect a paranormal incident of some kind.  Unfortunately, what occurs may not be quite enough to satisfy.  There are some creepy moments, cheesy jump scares, and decent special effects, but the magnitude of the horror isn't exactly overwhelming, and is sure to have some asking \"Is that it?\", when the film is over.Ti West's approach, reminiscent of some traditional 70's ghost stories, may be a fun change of pace for some.  Although rated R, what happens appears to fall well within the PG13 sphere.  The story holds together fairly well until the end, when the bottom falls out, and the door slams shut on the events at the Yankee Pedlar Inn."
B006RECSBC \"The Innkeepers\" is a thinking person's ghost story. That is what the latest effort from writer/director Ti West (\"The House of the Devil\") attempts to be. He would not resort to such familiar tricks as gores and loud noises to scare his audiences. That is a good thing. Unfortunately, the premise of \"The Innkeepers,\" good as it is, ends up being poorly executed. In short, the film is atmospheric and sporadically scary, but all in all tedious.\"The Innkeepers\" centers on two hotel clerks Claire (Sara Paxton) and Luke (Pat Healy) working for The Yankee Pedlar Inn that will close down soon. The hotel, it is rumored, is haunted by the ghost of Madeline O'Malley, a bride who died a tragic death many years ago. Claire and Luke, both enthusiastic about ghost stories and other paranormal activities, Claire and Luke, start investigating the legendary ghost, equipped with ghost hunting gear.Ti West as director employs a slow-burn approach for the first hour or so, keeping the pace deliberately slow with false alarms. That is not a bad idea. Then, while he ratchets up the tension towards the climax, he also leaves the interpretation of several key events open to our imagination. The problem is, most viewers would lose interest in what is going on before the film finally gets interesting.\"The Innkeepers\" takes too much time in setting up the characters and the inn's back stories. Claire is a college drop-out who does not know what she wants to do, while Luke is a self-proclaimed paranormal investigator. Besides that, not much is revealed about them. With the arrival of former actress Leanne Rease-Jones (Kelly McGillis) as a guest, who gives a warning to Claire, the story finally knows where it should go.Even then, without a compelling storyline and teasing details, the film keeps us waiting for the climax that is pretty good. Until then \"The Innkeepers\" is all about suggestions and insinuations about what to come in the end, but the characters' motives remain unclear and unconvincing, and the suggested mysteries are not intriguing. Not saying everything is a time-tested technique to build interest and tension, to be sure, but taking too much time to do so (and saying too little for that matter) is a different thing."
B006RECSBC This movie was so dull and plodding that I could barely stay awake.  It took much too long for anything at all to happen and then the payoff was dissatisfying."
B006RXPUQ8 The folks who made this movie were trying for a scify horror story that,1,doesn't show any understanding of science ( you can't clone a human from red blood cells-they have no dna ),and,2, tries to go for horror with a 'The Shineing' rip off.What they do succed in is regurgitating anti abortion propaganda, and do the disapearing good christians in the rapture bit.A 'mad scientist' wants to clone people, why his project is protected by soldiers is anybodies guess. A woman fertility doctor who can't have children steals one of the cloned embrios and implants it in her womb in the womens toilet. Cut to 'seven years later'. The boy heals a dead mouse. Mother takes the boy to see the 'mad scientist' who by now has had a religous conversion and kills his family so they can go to heaven. He smothers his wife with a pillow and smothers his little girl with a teddy bear. Their bodies disapear leaving only thier clothes behind, just like all the people in the church did.'Mad scientist' was trying to clone jesus! Wants the boy to forgive him! Shoots mom whos body disapears. But, oops!, the boy isn't Jesus, he's the anticrist. Movie ends with him asking satan a 'knock knock' joke.Don't waist your time on this; theres nothing new or well done here."
B006RXPUQ8 Excuse the cheesy line, but I'm Not Jesus Mommy isn't a good film. The film is about Kimberly who decides to impregnate herself with a stolen clone because she's not capable of having children. The film quickly jumps around from her impregnation, 9 months after that, then another 7 years after that to the apocalypse; poor storytelling throughout the film may leave you lost. The story really doesn't bother explaining much. It's a slightly interesting story but the acting is terrible. Kimberly, the mother character, has no emotion in her acting and all of her dialogue sounds terrible; no heart whatsoever in her acting leading to a painful-to-watch performance, she has some potential though. Also, if you watched the teasers/trailers you might be expecting a film similar to The Omen, but it really has only a few similarities.However, I did enjoy the music in the film a lot. Also, David, the child, was often genuinely creepy. I didn't dislike this film because of its scientific or religious elements; I dislike this film because it's simply a poorly executed movie.I do not recommend directly paying to watch I'm Not Jesus Mommy. If you must watch this movie, it is available on Netflix streaming as of 6/17/12 to save some money."
B006RXPUQ8 I'm Not Jesus Mommy (Vaughn Juares, 2010)For the first third or so of its length, save some subpar acting, I'm Not Jesus Mommy is an intriguing little low-budget movie that, on many levels, makes perfect sense. Kimberly Gabriel (Bridget McGrath in her first feature), an obstetrician, is haunted by her own inability to conceive. When maverick researcher Roger Gibson (Living Arrangements' Charles Hubbell) approaches her with a fat government contract and some snake oil about human cloning, she resists at first, but eventually sees the opportunity in light of her own ulterior motives. The obvious question becomes: how far will a woman go to have a baby?Then we skip forward seven years, and everything goes to hell. Earth is locked in the middle of a new ice age. The streets are dangerous, there is little food to go around, and Roger, Roger's sister, Kimberly, and Kimberly's son David are holed up in a small apartment, only going out when absolutely necessary to procure food. The entire remainder of the film takes place in that apartment.Sounds promising, no? And perhaps in the right hands, the final two-thirds of the movie could have been turned into the kind of tense sci-fi thriller that Vaughn Juares obviously intended this to be. But, and isn't there always a &#8220;but&#8221; after a statement like that?, it...isn't. I'm not entirely sure how to put this tactfully, so I'll go with &#8220;I'm not Jesus Mommy rivals The Room for moments of unintentional hilarity.&#8221;  One-room dramas live and die based on the quality of the actors involved, so the &#8220;some subpar acting&#8221; of the first third, which you can gloss over with everything else going on, takes center stage.  Add in a script that leaves out just a little too much to be impressionist and never avoids clich&eacute;&#8212;in fact, runs headlong into it as often as possible&#8212;and you've got something that ends up being a chore to sit through.  Don't hit play on this one unless you have prepared yourself for an overdose of cheese. *"
B006RXPUQ8 Creepy, scary, suspenseful and love watching over and over. I love Amazing post apocalyptic movies and this one is a doozy."
B006RXPUQ8 When I read about the film in Redbox (Devil's Angel), it reveals information that is not revealed in the film until the last 5-10 minutes. I won't do that per se, but the film is so bad, spoilers won't matter.Full figured Dr. Kimmy Gabriel (Bridget McGrath) can not have a child, but keeps on trying. She is very pro-life and reluctantly accepts a position at a human clone project under Dr. Roger Gibson (Charles Hubbell). She steals a cloned embryo and implants it in herself. The film jumps to seven years later as the world is thrust into a post apocalyptic nightmare as Kimmy and her son David (Rocko Hale) live in a run down tenement living off government MRE handouts.The film has heavy religious messages as both lesion faced Kim and Roger are very religious and frequently read from the Bible and listen to radio preachers. This appears to be a \"come to Jesus film\" except the \"good guys\" do nothing heroic to save the day or themselves. Indeed, if anything they appear to be part of the problem which is to make a statement about the condition of human existence.This film is very low budget. The sets are meager. The acting is bad and dialouge has a religious corniness to it. It fails to get interesting until 10 minutes before the final credits and by then you pray for the end.Knowing the \"secret\" of the film by reading the by-line I couldn't help but think during the film...\"Funny. He doesn't look Jewish.\"Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Bridget McGrath cleavage."
B006RZZDU4 Action packed, intelligent, creative, fun to watch on Kindle Fire.  Great writers and great Special affects that keep you glued to your chair and Kindle fire, if your wife does not need anything for duration!"
B006RZZDU4 This is a very good animation of iron man and the characters and story line was very good also.  When I watched Iron Man 3 and they mentionextremis and I decided to watch the animation series again and I enjoyed it very much. But it is more for mature audiences than children."
B006RZZDU4 4/5 for great story.Pros:1. Story is excellent.2. Decent visuals for a motion comic.3. It's the most epic Iron Man moment.Cons:1.  Story could be told in a more direct way.2.  Motion comics typically do not look very smooth and remind me of animations you might see on Newgrounds.3.  Voice acting could be a lot better, though it isn't bad per se."
B006RZZDU4 Show has elements from movie and animation is cool as a moving comic.  Great to be able to view on Kindle Fire HD."
B006RZZDU4 I ordered this movie series because of my little grandson.  He loves the  action but at 3 yrs he doesn't stay long on any one show.  The older grandkids will enjoy the entire series."
B006RZZDU4 Very fresh update telling of Iron Man series, the only problem I have with it is that it's a motion comic which I have yet to get used to. Would definitely recommend it if you like the Iron Man series."
B006RZZDU4 This series ie worth watching if you like the minimalist animated Comic Book style.  I do and so its entertaining to me.  My wife on the other hand found it a bit boring.If you enjoy modern comic art this should be a treat, if not you probably won't."
B006RZZDU4 I actually like watching this animated series with my 4yr old.He likes all the super hero stuff though....but then so do I."
B006S0007E I've been reading Norse and Greek mythology since I could pick up a book, and even when I could understand the differences between the two, I knew that for the most part, Thor and Loki got along. Unlike the Greek gods, the Norse gods could die, but they never grew old -- and even Odin retained his savage strength until his death at the battle of Ragnorak. So to see Loki old and missing teeth is repulsive; and being so stereotypically evil is a sign of poor writing. Pass on this. True, Loki's actions in regard to Balder's passing did lead to Ragnorak and to his own death, as well as Thor's, Odin's and the other gods, but he wasn't the cackling super villain  depicted in these ridiculous cartoons. Buy the movies instead. They're more entertaining."
B006S0007E This is a stop motion comic book and I enjoyed it very much.  Years ago marvel came out with comics books on CD for the computer which I brought and they was very good but I think the public was not ready for the CDs and they did not sell.  I still have these disc but they plays on a very old cumputer system like window 98 and I canot play them anymore but I enjoyed them very much and I am glad they came out with the stop motion comics.  This is a good buy."
B006S0007E Considering the current level of animation this is almost primitive, though well-drafted. Animation is sparse and motion is often portrayed by moving the static image in the frame which I found to be like watching shadow puppets. It's well-written and probably too mature and cerebral for children. Not really a waste of time but not action entertainment or even decent anime."
B006S0007E The so-called animation for this series was interesting.  I guess it's been referred to as &#34;motion comic&#34; and that's certainly a much more applicable term.  Basically, there's very little movement/animation, so it's like reading or hearing a comic book, but with some minor animations.  Normally, that's not my cup of tea, but I've given this four stars because the writing of this series was good enough to keep me interested in this motion comic series.  I would, however, caution you to expect far more Loki than Thor, so the title is somewhat misleading."
B006S0007E Interesting and boring all at once comic books have traditionally been meant as a moral compass for the youth of the US, and, in more recent times, for cultures world-wide.  So it is that the Norse god of thunder and his apparently \"adopted\" brother Loki are pitted against one another in a sort of Kane and Abel kind of story, where one has the unique opportunity to get rid of the competition.After much hemming and hawing the plot is finally put into motion, but with unsurprising results.  I say unsurprising because I have a hard time believing that a disgruntled brother, one who has a history of malfeasance, would transform so in the amount of time given to this story.  Particularly since he comes from an extremely bloody pantheon and society based upon combat and bloodshed.  But, that's the magic of comic books.The technical merits of the film are interesting.  Fully rendered comic book panels are rendered into CGI animation, and proves an interesting watch.  Moreover actually bringing the actual comic book experience to life, so to speak, perhaps not to ironically enough, shows how rediculous some of the stories actually are, and exposes the time twisting that comic book artists and story tellers use to convey their psychological message.  Think about how much time has passed in all four episodes of this saga, and think about Loki's resolution to his own dilemma.Not bad, really, but not amazingly good.  If you're into comic books, then this should entertain.  Otherwise I'd skip it."
B006SV4QFK I love books. And art supplies. And all things Disney. And... well, the list goes on.  So, I'll confess that I like shows about hoarding because they nudge me to weed out and reorganize. I never want my home to resemble what I see on &#34;Hoarders.&#34;However, at a certain point -- and Season 5 of &#34;Hoarders&#34; seems to be there -- the &#34;ah-HA!&#34; light bulb turns on. Instead of the cool, quirky, &#34;Wow... how very weird!&#34; intrigue of the cases featured on the show... well, this season seems sad.All of these people seem mentally ill. Most have experienced some kind of trauma that triggered the impulse to hold onto everything, or build an insulating wall of stuff around them as a defense, or both.  And, all of them have made their own lives a misery and had a profoundly negative impact on people they love.I'm not sure that should be on the TV as entertainment. Unfortunately, they're not actual documentaries, either. I mean, we all know the problems we're seeing aren't actually resolved in an hour, a week, or even a year, no matter how great the aftercare.So, while these shows still kick me into gear so I revisit my various personal indulgences (like books and art supplies), the subject -- as something to watch on TV -- has become less entertaining.  Instead of taking the show in the direction of weirder & weirder collections and hoarding efforts, this season seemed to head in an unhappy direction. They're featuring more deeply traumatized people with more devastating and tragic impacts on the people around them.I'll continue watching because I'm hoping the producers realized most viewers aren't there to see the train wreck.  We don't turn on the TV to pity others... do we?  Well, maybe I'm one of a minority of viewers who watch &#34;Hoarders&#34; (and similar TV shows) for two reasons: To see how very interesting people are when they allow collecting to run wild, and to recognize those impulses we all have, and clean house long before collecting becomes a problem."
B006SV4QFK This show has inspired me to clean up my stuff.  Vance thinks his IQ is 200, yet he's not smart enough to figure out how to clean his house.  He's the kind of person teaching at your child's university."
B006SV4QFK This show shows you just how things can get out of control.  I feel for these people who live alone and have just given up on life, it's very sad.  Some of them seem like really nice people and this shouldn't be happening to them.  If you want a dose of reality, this is a show to watch.  Sometimes when I think times are tough, this show proves it could be a lot worse.  The 1-800-GOT-JUNK guys seem really nice and considerate of people's possessions, given the situation.  Dorothy is great, Matt is wonderful and I absolutely love Dr. Zasio!  They are all wonderful people who try to help those less fortunate.  A true reality show!!!"
B006SV4QFK I know people who are &#34;collectors&#34; but what they collect have value.  A person who collects junk definitely needs professional help!  Another thing I cannot understand is how people can live in such filth!  You have to have a mental problem in order to do so.I watch these shows and they reassure me that I'm still all right!"
B006SV4QFK mental illness is a fascinating thing and how people get attached to objects because they've been let down by friends or family is really fascinating. I don't, however, feel sorry for them. they are fully aware of what they are doing"
B006SV4QFK After watching these people I feel like I need to take a shower. Where do they find these hoarders they make it seem like there is one in every neighborhood. The show is good but after a couple of episodes it is all the same someone with OCD who has too much stuff and can't part with it. I often wonder if it is even real. One season would have been enough."
B006SV4QFK We watch this almost like watching a train wreck. So many people with some kind of quirky genetic makeup! They could all be related. Always mention some tragic event which triggers the hoarding behavior. Not sure that makes sense when so many people handle tragedies every day. Love how the team manages to scoop out much of the mess and it always gives us incentive to drop off a load at Goodwill!"
B006SV4QFK It is amazing to me how some people live their lives. This show shows some pretty extreme cases of hoarding and the steps they take to fix the situation."
B006SV4QFK Barbara has a messy house where she cares for her grandson.  He's a cutie-puh-tootie.  She has beef with her daughter-in-law and seemed like a white Mother Jefferson to me.No offense, one notices that Richard is a swishy fishy.  You hear nothing about a wife or girlfriend in the picture.  The therapist said, \"Richard is not secure in his identity.\"  His sister said, \"Richard is keeping a secret from us.\"  So near the end, words come up that Richard finally tells his siblings what any viewer would know from jump.  It's a bit anti-climactic that they don't film it.  I'm guessing his adult siblings didn't care because they could just assume it.  I wish the show had interviewed them about it.  If you see the cartoon \"Drawn Together,\" every character's face turns into a donkey's when they say \"Duhhhhhh!!!\" when the fey character comes out.  The same will happen here.  In short, the pink elephant in the room is so obviously a pink triangle, that it really shouldn't have been an issue.To be honest, sometimes the \"Hoarders\" episodes with closeted or out rainbow-flag men are the most interesting.  I recommend this, despite my frustrations."
B006SV4QFK Frank and Mike manage to find plenty of good items to look at and make offers on. I always like to see them make a fair offer, and often they hit the jackpot. It's a win-win situation."
B006SV4QFK The minds of some people are very interesting.  It is sad but the reality exists and shedding light on it helps to bring it out if the shadows and into the light where it can be addressed. I thinks it is a fascinating show."
B006SV4QFK No, I'm not a hoarder but may have a mental problem with getting enough of this series. It is disturbing yet as soon as one episode ends I can't wait for the next one to begin. I've known hoarders in my lifetime and this show presents them perfectly. In most cases they will glom on to their worthless and disgusting junk at the expense of their family and friends.I guess I have a stomach of steel as this is my &#34;go to&#34; lunchtime show. I can't get enough."
B006SV4QFK If you do, just watch The Hoarders. I always find it amazing that these people get so irrate with those who want to help and love them. Most choose things over their family...so sad.  I do realize they are sick in their own way, but I always walk away from this program feeling that my house is immaculate."
B006SV4QFK Unreal. Have heard of this problem and I think most people have seen garages or basements that have &#34;stuff&#34; that should go but is &#34;needed.&#34; May watch a few more on my kindle fire. Loaded and played with no problems."
B006SV4QFK I'm not at all sure there is anything better than an exclusive tour of other people's filth. THAT is entertainment!"
B006SV4QFK Sad to peek into the mind of a sick person. Where things rule their life and human interaction is very damaged.  What I wondered is how family can allow things to get so out of hand.  It is like watching a sickening warm film, you have to see how it ends,"
B006SV4QFK Very interesting......this show makes me feel good about myself and helps me keep my house clean!"
B006SV4QFK I love watching this show, because it gives me the feeling of having just cleaned my house from top to bottom without actually having to do anything."
B006SV5Z0U My granddaughter (20 years old) and I watched the whole series in a marathon all nighter. We laughed our heads off. Haven't had that much fun with her and a TV since she liked Disney."
B006SV5Z0U A colleague asked that I view this season because there is an overlap in our specific medical interests. With heroine addiction as in other types of substance abuse, there is decreased ability in the body's immune system and infectious disease becomes more difficult to treat. I very much doubt that I would be able to accomplish what she does with interventions. There seems to be so much darkness before there can be light again . . . if death doesn't intervene! Yes, I do understand addiction and the absolute need for intervention and treatment. Diagnosing an infectious disease process for substance abusers requires treating both conditions . . . it's the same body/mind. It was past difficult to observe that one intervention and this is certainly an accurate portrayal of the 'real' one.Recommended? That's a good question that I don't have a glib answer for . . . those considering an intervention? Substance abusers? Those interested in human behavior? Perhaps one episode if you are interested in finding a few answers to your own questions.The above was my review for Season 10. All of these episodes present variations of the 'typical' profile of substance abusers. This is not to negate an individuals circumstances but to emphasize their personalities. There is an accurate portrayal of dysfunction within the family unit and other relationships. The multiple substances of choice offer a wide spectrum and an accurate description of the medical/mental consequences.I've viewed 'Chasing The White Dragon,' 'The Global Addiction,' 'Afghanistan: The Opium Trail,' and 'One Man's Seduction.' If you have an interest in grower to user, 'The Global Addiction' is a 30 min production by ABC Australia, that is well narrated and reasonably accurate."
B006SV5Z0U Nothing special, the formula seems to work for the show but I am finding it starting to drag on. Same ol, same ol."
B006SV5Z0U Rainbow flag men and boys have so many barriers and biases to face.  Richard dealt with his dear sister's death and being molested for years without others knowing.  He's had it tough, but he still ends up being a jerk here.He kinda reminded me of Andy Bell of Erasure, except I have nothing but respect for Mr. Bell.  Richard did some activist/non-profit work; I'm guessing he had anti-drug resources that he didn't bother to access.  Yes, his brother is/was homophobic, but he seemed more understanding of Richard than the other way around.  He is sucking his mother dry of money.  The work never mentions HIV/AIDS, but he engaged in lots of activities that I would imagine could put him in great risk.My favorite part of any \"Intervention\" episode is when the addicted person walks into the hotel room and sees their loved ones.  Richard wasn't even brave enough to stay.  You never really see him for the rest of the episode.The episode ends by saying Richard is no longer on drugs.  I highly doubt that.  He just seemed very nasty and abusive.  I can't imagine him staying sober.  He really needs to do nicer things so he can get some good Karma.  Otherwise, he's in BIG, BIG trouble!"
B006SV5Z0U and should not be on tv. There is little redeeming value to this -only shock value. Swamp people is better"
B006SV5Z0U I can't stop watching this show - it is so dramatic but in a real way.  It is heartbreaking but often redeeming as well."
B006TA764S This British indy film had received a lot of attentions and favorable reviews, mainly from British film media.The film has a simple story about 2 semi-professional(?) contractors received orders with a \"kill list\".The first 3 acts are alright with a good cast but the last act is too slight to make it a good and satisfyingthriller and doesn't justify the foregoing grisly violence."
B006TA764S A strange ultra violent descent into Hell is what this film is. Some have thought the ending is out of left field but if you watch closely throughout and just let the film wash over you, it makes sense. The musical score adds to the tension so much. Not since Rosemary's Baby have I felt the musiccontributed in such an unnerving way. Rent this if you want something different than the usual horror films that have ruined the genre lately."
B006TA764S Surreal best describes.  It may even have spiritual/philosophical undertones.. there's an air of pagan magic and \"the occult\" about it as well.  While it starts off in the hitman thriller genre it slowly morphs into something more akin to \"The Wicker Man\" (the original 70s version is the best) or \"Race With The Devil (Peter Fonda/1975).  The fact that it can be so open to interpretion, the fact that it veers off the tracks of the \"real world\" into a world of cosmic grand conspiracy against the main protagonist, the mysterious \"Thank yous\" from all around this bewildered hit man, and what finally happens in the end, somehow bring it back to the possibility of moral lesson or cosmic point, albeit one taught by the devil in the realm of the acid trip.  The movie succeeds in its utter ability to stump or be understood within the confines of realism - a realism which is the initial basis of the movie.  British movies have done this to us before - see \"If\".  And yet from beginning to end it's a well-made and interesting story that quickly involves the watcher.  Whether you're a fan of the abstract or not, it's not a hard movie to watch though there's no doubt it baffles in its ending.  And this will be the chief criticism against it.  The brilliance or lack thereof will largely depend on the interpretation the viewer brings to it.  I don't claim to understand it but I fairly enjoyed it."
B006TA764S I do remember commenting at its end that it was a decent watch.  Obviously, once is enough. So enough said."
B006TA764S This film is a great example of what you get when you forget about the importance of a story. Watch the first scene and pay attention, because that's exactly how the rest of the film will be. And don't let all the claims of gore and blood and violence lure you in, either. It's very tame and unrealistic. Too bad. Next time I hope this director will take the time to tell a story."
B006TA764S This is by far one of the most polarizing films you're ever bound to see if you've even heard of it, but Ben Wheatley's KILL LIST is definitely unforgettable, love it or hate it.The film does change thematically throughout and becomes more of a stream-of-consciousness style of film rather than a more traditional narrative structure. Basically we have the wedded bliss of contract killer Jay (Neil Maskell) and his former military wife Shel (MyAnna Buring) being interrupted by his failure eight months before of completing a job and hasn't been able to get one since. The world economic strife is hitting them hard, and Jay has sort of lost his nerve. Jay and Shel are almost constantly arguing and undermining each other, with their son hearing all of it. But when old friend/contract killer Gal (Michael Smiley) comes by with a new job to clean the dust off Jay and get everything back to where it all was for them before all this agitation. The job, presented by a rather devious and malevolent cabal, is the killing of three people, guilty of various (and partially unknown) crimes. Gal and Jay begin this job in order to get paid, and in order to restore Jay back to the proper and formidable villain he once was. But these three murders turn out to be something quite different and far more sinister once we reach the last act of the film, and our protagonists are now in more danger than the people they were pursuing.Wheatley films KILL LIST with a eye for craftsmanship and for cinema verite style filmmaking. Almost all of the scenes have a very documentarian feel to them and it just makes the moments of violence and horror that much more unsettling, until you get to the muscle-clenching climax, where the editing becomes much more disjointed and jagged. The scenes between Jay, Gal, and Shel have a very workaday feel to them. These people have no illusions about the nature of the work they do; this work just happens to be to their skill set, and they're good at it... or at least they used to be before things went wrong in the previous months. There's no philosophical rumination about the amoral nature of being a hired killer here; this is just a job to them, and it's that sort of attitude that works to the film's advantage. There's no romanticism of the trade here. Being a contract killer is not a glorious job, and this film does put that element out there really skillfully. Maskell, who has made a good name for himself in British TV and film, does a terrific job being the film's anchor. We share in his frustration, his anger, his justifiable rage and his fear. Buring, who is better known stateside for her small but significant roles in two Neil Marshall films: THE DESCENT and DOOMSDAY, as well as a role in TWILIGHT: BREAKING DAWN (Pts 1 and 2), is a combination of roles that only a wife and a mother and a killer can deliver. She's a dynamic performer who obviously has a distinct flavor for genre films. The real standout here is Smiley as Gal, who plays him with just the proper mix of aloof and serious and undenaibly likable. He's appeared before for Wheatley and alongside Maskell in one of their previous efforts called DOWN TERRACE, and he's a terrific performer.Although, no amount of plot description or analysis of acting or directing will be able to distill how the film turns and twists until it's something nearly unrecognizable. This will be a love-it-or-hate-it third act, although upon repeated viewings (which is almost required with this film), it remains ambiguous as far as what you've just seen.Listening to the commentary track for this film from director Wheatley and writer Amy Jump, or the cast commentary by Maskell, Buring and Smiley, the tone certainly doesn't match what's on-screen. They seem to be having a terrific time talking about making the film, but make sure that they don't give facts about the controversial ending, and rather discussing how ambiguous it was and why they wanted to keep it that way.I learned about KILL LIST from a website talking about SXSW releases and how this was one of the best and most unusual selections, and I wished I was with someone while watching, because I got it on demand from my cable company when it was in limited release in theatres and I desperately wanted to talk to someone about it immediately after. I will say that it left a very similar impression upon my psyche as SE7EN did back in 1995. It took me a while to recover from the shock and the disturbing nature of the ending, but when a film has the power to do that, it's something to relish, despite how compelled you might be to look away.KILL LIST is one of my ten favorite films of 2011, and as I stated previously, you will either love this film or you'll hate it, but regardless, it will stay with you."
B006TA764S First, get actors that can actually speak rather than mumble.  Or use subtitles.  I have to agree with the kitchen sink analogy. Because that's pretty much what the writers did.  Whatever was in their heads just came barreling out into a total mess. Or they were channeling \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\".  There is nothing coherent about this movie.  It simply makes no sense.  You can rattle on about Arthurian theories and some grand plan, but the bottom line is that it's just a bad movie.  It's billed as the number one horror movie of the year. Perhaps my definition of horror is different than the producers of this dreck. Because there was nothing horrifying in this crap.  Oh, it was gory and bloody alright.  But horrifying?  I'd call some of the singing on American Idol horrifying, but not this.  Perhaps they should let someone with a Hitchcockian background redo this into what could be a very good movie. And just because a movie makes you think, doesn't make it good. Actually, the only three thoughts you'll have is 1) what the hell is going on? 2) When will this crap end? and 3) How can I get my money back?.  Go see Expendables 2.  It's a bad movie too, but at least it's entertaining.  You'll never say that about Kill List."
B006TA764S gotta say the first 65 percent of the movie is a classic slow burn. wonderfully shot, written and acted. loved the dinner scene. loved the intrigue. loved the mystery.....again, slow burn...that said : the movie, out of nowhere and at the worst possible time takes a complete change of course and...im not gonna ruin it...becomes way too symbolic and surreal to be entertaining. im all about having a deeper meaning in films...but this one just rams its ideals down your throat and tries very hard to be intelligent.shame. the director has a good thing going and then decided to insult the audience by going back to film school and make a pretentious ending. if i wanted to rent Eyes Wide Shut i would have...this movie could of been a game changer for horror movies for years to come but settled on cliche."
B006TA764S I had a lot of trouble just making out the dialogue either because of the audio quality, the particular British accents the actors adopted, and/or my own aging ears, but on the other hand, what's going on is pretty self-evident.  Two former military buddies get together to collaborate on working as professional hitmen because they need the money and one of them has to live down a botched job in Kiev.  He brutally kills a number of allegedly bad people as if to make up for his previous slip-up, until the two of them run into a bit of a pickle in the end (to say the least).  In between all the blood and guts spilled, the men act like normal if a bit neurotic blokes, one of them with an unbelievably loyal wife and kid and the other with an attractive but mysterious girlfriend with an apparent penchant for witchery of the black kind.It's not the kind of film that I normally watch because of the gore and violence level, but it features excellent acting, very effective background music, and sickeningly realistic special effects.  It's kind of like a Quentin Tarantino film on steroids. I wouldn't recommend it except to those with a strong stomach, so I'm only giving it three stars."
B006TA764S In all honesty I didn't know what I was getting myself into with this British film directed by Ben Wheatley.  I almost pulled the plug as the first act seemed to drone on endlessly with no point.  In addition, although I'm no newcomer to various English accents coming out of the U. K., no matter how loud I turned up the sound, I couldn't comprehend what half the words were.  So my fellow Americans, my advice is go ahead and put on the English subtitles, shift gears and hang on for one of the most head-scratching films you'll see.The movie evolves from a domestic squabble between Shel (MyAnna Buring), a former Swedish soldier and Jay (Neil Maskell), a temporarily unemployed killer-for-hire.  After a job went south in Russia, Jay's nerves are a bit shaky but his partner in crime, Gal (Michael Smiley), convinces him it's time to get back in the game.  They do and their targets are focused on a priest and likely pedophile and a porn distributor.At this stage we're not too concerned about their fate.  They deserve what they get.  Yet something is amiss.  They thank Jay before their demise.  Events become more and more unsettling as their search for their targets drives them into areas they (and I) didn't see coming.  The occult and Satanism show their faces.  As the movie shifts into high gear, it also changes tone, now entering some scary and gory horror.  And Wheatley and his writing partner, Amy Jump, don't pull their punches.  I'm still trying to figure out what I just saw.  I suspect you might too."
B006TA764S Are you kidding me!  That is the only thing I can say after painfully suffering through watching one the worst non-horror films of all time.  This was not scary and the concept was very poor...watch this if you want to waste time and money."
B006TA764S Kill List (Ben Wheatley, 2011)I have talked, over the years, a number of times about the importance of studios marketing their movies correctly, and how the mismarketing of a movie can lead to not one, but two related, major problems: the audience who should be seeing the movie not cottoning to its existence, and the audience who should not be seeing the movie (those it is being marketed to) sitting down with it, finding something entirely different than they were told they'd be getting, and absolutely hating it as a result. Between these two problems, the movie ends up becoming almost universally reviled, and then that first group, the ones who would probably get a great deal out of it, hear it sucks and never get there in the first place. I've used all my favorite whipping boys for this in recent reviews, so let me introduce you to an incredible Chicago filmmaker by the name of Ricardo Islas. Islas makes what I like to call aggressively-indie films. They have no discernible budget, use sets that are just as ridiculous as those you find in Ulli Lommel and Uwe B&ouml;ll movies (though given Islas' budget, they make a lot more sense here), star a bunch of people you've never heard of, and are consistently marketed as horror movies. In some cases, that kind of makes sense; when you title one of your movies The Zombie Farm, you gotta figure someone's going to pick up on the fact that the movie contains zombies and act accordingly. But kids who have been raised in the post-Romero era, and who have never seen White Zombie or any of the other movies that treat zombies in a more traditional way are going to look at The Zombie Farm and say \"what the hell is this crap?\". (The Zombie Farm, by the way, is a fantastic little thriller, and while it's not Islas' best work--when I started this paragraph I had intended to harp on the brilliance of my favorite movie of his, Lockout--but you gotta see it anyway.)NOTE: while the spoiler stop sign is below, this is one case where I will be actively encouraging you to read the spoilers in question, as I believe NOT knowing them will negatively affect your viewing of them film (there is more than enough spoiler-laden evidence of this on the IMDB boards to justify this decision).[for those of you not reading this at var.everta, imagine there's a big \"SPOILER ALERT! stop sign here.]What does all of this have to do with Ben Wheatley?, you may be asking yourself. It has to do with Wheatley because Kill List, in everything I heard and read about the movie before I actually saw it, including all of the reviews I allowed myself to read, posited Kill List as Yet Another British Crime Thriller, but a cut above the usual malarkey. So I'm sitting down with this movie thinking I'm going to get another Ray Winstone movie (and wondering why Ray Winstone is, in fact, not in this film), and instead I get The Wicker Man. Except that it took me about thirty minutes of my sitting there saying \"what the [censored for Amazon consumption] did I just watch?\" to realize that I had, in fact, seen a movie that had far more in common with The Wicker Man and the not-quite-Hammer films of its early-seventies ilk than anything Guy Ritchie ever did. (And, as Captain Peacock was wont to say, \"Thank Heaven for that.\") But still, I did sit there for thirty minutes asking myself the question. And here's where the marketing bit comes in. I admit, I came quite late to The Wicker Man. I first saw it when I was in high school, though I can't give you a specific year; it was sometime in the mid-eighties. I loathed it, but I knew exactly what I was getting into thanks to the VHS box copy and everything I'd read about the film. I knew there was a supernatural element to it from the outset, and I was prepared for that. (I didn't form my current love of the film until the 104-minute cut was released in the late-nineties, which made much more sense out of the incomprehensible soup that was the initial American theatrical cut. And as I write this, it was just announced earlier this week that something I have been hoping would happen for over a decade has finally come to pass: the twenty-two minutes of footage from the original 126-minute cut, which me pal Ian Davey has been telling me forever was probably part of the M1, has been found, and there's a newly-remastered director's cut coming on DVD eventually. Oh, happy day.) And for all I know this entire paragraph is a spoiler, and you're not supposed to know about the supernatural element to this movie until it's sprung on you. If so, well, I'll put the spoiler stop sign up at the top of this paragraph when I publish it, but hey guys? That was a really, really bad idea, not letting the public know that this wasn't your basic Britcrime movie.It starts out that way. Jay (Atonement's Neil Maskell), an ex-army hit man, hasn't worked in eight months, and the money's run out. Something horrible happened on his last job, but other than us finding out something horrible happened on his last job, we never get any details. His wife Shel (The Descent's MyAnna Buring) is sick of him moping about the house and, in the kind of manipulative move that drives me bats, invites Jay's old partner Gal (Burke and Hare's Michael Smiley) and his new girlfriend Fiona (TV actress Emma Fryer in her first credited feature appearance) over for dinner so Gal can pitch a new job he's just picked up to Jay. Despite his misgivings, Jay is intrigued, so they go to meet the client (Chariots of Fire's Struan Rodger). Seems simple enough: three murders, no questions asked, for an unthinkable sum of money. The first one makes very little sense, but it's quick and easy. The second starts putting the pieces together, and Jay, once he figures out the connection between the three victims, starts off on his own tangent......absolutely none of which has to do with the horror element, really, though all of it does, in murky ways that I can't address without going deep into spoiler territory here. It's a decent movie, and I am certain I would have liked it better had I known what I was getting. The acting is, in general, quite good, though in a number of cases the actors are making the best they can out of mediocre material (did anyone buy the relationship between Jay and Shel? Really?), and the movie is excellently-paced once you figure out what Wheatley's doing, or what you think he's doing. Granted, it's not The Wicker Man (or A Serbian Film, to which it has also been compared many times), but it does what it does and does so relatively well much of the time. But you're probably better off knowing what you're getting into. ** "
B006TA764S This movie had real potential but lost its way along the way and the reveal was predictable by way of the build up. But it was entertaining most of the time."
B006TA764S A very interesting mix of genres that culminates in a climax that I'm still scratching my head over. Think hitmen, a decent into darkness, and the wicker man (the good one, not the Nic Cage movie). Give it a watch. The brit accents can be a little thick at times and I wish there was a subtitle option, but most people will be able to weather through it and gradually get the cadence. I liked it, but I was left with many many questions."
B006TA764S I could watch this movie three more times and still not understand it, no, I don't think I could ever understand it."
B006TA764S I'll be stunned if a worse movie comes out this year. If you liked Wicker Man and thought it needed to be slower, mix more genres, and be a bigger waste of time, then this film will be right up your alley. It's the kind of film that makes me rethink people's recommendations because if they liked this then we're most certainly looking for different things out of two hours of our time."
B006TA764S I will not say anything but this about this amazingly written story. It is a sort of action drama and a horror film. Definitely see this one, one of the best of the year. I promise you will not be dissapointed."
B006TA764S This is an independent horror drama from director and writer Ben Wheatley who has worked with comedians Steve Coogan and Jonny Vegas in the past, but this one does not have a foot in the realm of comedy. It is about two old army buddies, who decided to become hit men after their country no longer needed them. We join Jay (Neil Marshall) a year after a bungled job in Kiev. His acerbic wife Shell (played with brilliant complexity by MyAnna Buring) tells him all their money is gone, as he has not done any `work' for a year. He meanwhile only wants to cure his back in their hot tub; she insists he is making it all up and there is nothing wrong with him.Then his old mucker turns up, Gal (Michael Smiley). They are having a dinner party and Gal has brought his latest flame Fiona, a mysterious one indeed who seems to enjoy pentangle like symbols. Well after a mass row, Gal invites Jay to go back to work. They agree and set off to meet their client. He gives them a hit list that includes a priest a librarian and an MP. They are not told their crimes and so Jay lets his imagination fill in the blanks. He is still traumatised from past experiences and seems to find some form of mental rehabilitation through inflicting violence. This he goes at with some very worrying gusto indeed.What unfolds gets darker and darker as the violence escalates and things are seen in their true light. This is one from the school of seventies horror with a sort of cross between the classic `The Wicker Man'and Peter Fonda's lost classic `Race with the Devil' . There is plenty of disturbing violence, language that a docker would baulk at and some brilliantly tense scenes. The soundtrack works too, even though at first I felt it was trying to be too spooky with echoey voices all over the place. By the end you will not notice as everything coalesces to a climax that kept me guessing.Not a straight forward horror as there is a lot of life drama too and some exploration of the mental luggage that people acquire who have been in stressful situations. All of the acting was above par and a lot is left unexplained, in that you automatically fill in the gaps. I actually thought this was really good. Also a note on funding, this was a collaboration with the UK Film Council and Channel 4 who should be praised for their involvement, it's a shame the Council is being abolished. If you like the new wave of Brit horrors then this is up there with the better ones."
B006TA764S It was an interesting movie.  Very off beat.  Make no mistake it is a horror movie and a little sick and twisted.  I had read the description and its not a film about paranoia or anything like that.  I don't want to ruin the movie for others so I won't give away the story. But, you'll need a strong stomach for this one and in the end you may still shake your head.  I gave it three stars because it is so unusual.  It was not my type of movie due to the nature of the film.  Family drama?  Really?"
B006TA764S SPOILERS:An unusual mixture of genres, \"Kill List\" is a moody film about a hitman who takes on a series of assignments where each of those that he kills thanks him and tell him it was an honor. This, needless to say, is disquieting to our hitman who gradually realizes his assignment has some surreal turns to it.\"Kill List\" is an ambitious, moody and, sometimes meandering, thriller that combines the genre with horror as it takes a left turn into territory of \"The Wicker Man\". \"Kill List\" isn't for everyone but it is a pretty powerful film from director Ben Wheatley who tends to take material that could be conventionally explored and give it a unique twist.END OF SPOILERS:I enjoyed \"Kill List\" but this moody thriller may not be for everyone as it's not a straight forward, easy to digest or explain mixture of thriller and horror film that crosses two genres quite effectively.The special features who purchase the blu-ray (as opposed to renting the title but I would suggest a rental first to see if this appeals to you) are commentary track by the director, a second commentary track featuring the two leads,and interviews with the cast and director discussing the making of the film.Unconventional to say the least, \"Kill List\" is a moody thriller that builds its tension. If you're looking for a more traditional Hollywood style thriller, \"Kill List\" is probably not for you but, if you're looking for a challenging, interesting thriller with an unconventional mixture of genres you might find yourself ready for the \"Kill List\"."
B006U3MY7S Everyone loves Dog! Its a very addicting show and a much watch :) Lots of action and adventure in this reality show!"
B006U3MY7S Watch Dog and his family, get the bad guys.  I just like how he interacts with the criminals he picks up.  If you don't mind some racy outfits and a few cuss words, then let the kids watch too!"
B006U3MY7S Having only watched a few episodes when tuning into cable, the wife and I binged on this and enjoyed the mayhem.  You probably will as well.  Especially if you liked Cops on Fox."
B006U3MY7S love this show and especially the characters.  I like the great message Dog and Beth always share and it is fun to watch"
B006U3MY7S This show gives an insight into what bounty hunters go through to capture fugitives. Some of the episodes are quite entertaining."
B006U3MY7S Gotta love it. Love when they get done swearing and calling each other names, then ok, lets pray. Truly a great show."
B006U3MY7S I just like to listen to the theme song and then i turn it off. if you have seen three episodes you have seen enough."
B006U3MY7S Prime ( free episodes ) is  only  on the ones I have seen but at least the sounds works. At least it's a step in the right direction."
B006U3MY7S Reality TV is supposed to bring the \"real world\" to TV.  If this program represents reality, give me fantasy any time. Here we have \"Dog\" and his minions prancing around in all their police/military style paraphernalia, followed by a TV crew and they are supposed to be \"sneaking up\" on some residence. Why not just get the local high school band out and really announce your presence in style? But then again, with the outfit Dog is wearing, perhaps the band would be wasted. Honestly, he looks like a worn out old guy who works Fremont Street in Vegas, charging for tourists to have their photograph taken with him.  Ok, so they find a car (a Sebring we are told many times) and we are besieged with shot after shot of each of the \"team\" in turn having a look through the car window. Now isn't that really exciting?  And if we are not seeing shots of someone looking through the window of the car, we are continually confronted with shots of Dog's wife's legs and her stiletto shoes. Now that is not a pretty sight.Yes, I am sure (from reading some of the other reviews) that there are people who really like the show.  But from what I have seen, this program is certainly not \"reality\", it is definitely not entertainment and it is absolutely not worth watching. The best thing that has happened is that this show has finally been \"pulled\"."
B006U3MY7S While the content of the series is exciting to watch and the family is charismatic, their choice of language (even though semi-tweeted out) is a bit disheartening.  Running through neighborhoods of young children yelling the filthy language just isn't appealing to me."
B006U3MY7S I love the end- the way leland smiled at his beaufiful little girl and she smiled back . that is priceless.  And it was one of the better shows :)"
B006UAWH2S This film is slow but it is meant to be because it is an elegy to the loss of the senses, one by one.  Two beautiful people fall in love when this begins worldwide,  The order of loss is smell, taste, hearing, vision.  The beautiful thing this film does is that as each sense is loss there is a renewed but brief celebration of the sense or senses left. The world is also ending.  There is no reason discernible for any of this,This is one of many end of the world films or books which have come forth in the some number in the last few years,  There seems to be almost no interest in depicting us being overtaken by aliens and sent to oblivion by them. No, this is the end of our world on earth as given by each writer's take on now it will occur,  Although the woman is a doctor working in illness outbreak, she is unable to prove that this is any dissease.Another clever aspect is that each loss is preceded by some wild emotional outburst.  The smell one is preceded by fits of sobbing.  The hearing one starts with a fit of rage.  I found it fascinating that an avalanche of emotion heralded each loss.This film grows on you,  The first twenty minutes passes very, very slowly but if you stick with it, you will find yourself pulled into it.As an added benefit, Ewan McGregor and Eva Green in the lead roles, have to be two of the most gorgeous people on the planet.  Louis CK recently did a comedy act where he said that he'd been a heterosexual all of his forty plus years.  However, he recently met Ewan MacGregor and found himself just mesmerized by how beautiful he was.  Finally he concluded that even he could turn gay briefly if it meant he could have Ewan!I think the movie is great if you can hang in there through the very slow start."
B006UAWH2S Perfect Sense is perfectly awful. It's about a chef (Ewan McGregor) and an epidemiologist (Eva Green), two people who go for each other but who have major relationship problems. They find themselves in the middle of a worldwide epidemic -- after crying a bit people lose their sense of smell. Then taste. Then hearing. Then sight.What can the world do? What can humanity do? What can Michael and Susan do? The answer, my friend, is written by a deeply earnest screenwriter and filmed by an otherwise interesting director: Love each other...take care of each other...trust each other. All this is accompanied with a deeply serious voice over that makes sure we understand the importance of what we see, along with a music score that drips with tragedy and then hope.To watch an infinitely better movie by the same director and also  starring Ewan McGregor, try the excellent and unpleasant Young Adam."
B006UAWH2S Say this much for the Brits they sure know how to make great Armageddon movies i.e \"Twenty Eight Days Later\" and \"Shaun of the Dead\".  \"Perfect Sense\" works for the most part but doesn't quite hit it out of the ballpark.  Where it is most successful is in portraying the world breaking down.  Director David MacKenzie probably didn't have the resources of your typical Hollywood disaster pic but he successfully melds scenes of his own creation with news footage to create a society in chaos.  Where the film falls short is in its central conceit of the world falling deeper into the abyss as the passion between the central lovers(Ewan McGregor and Eva Green) intensifies.  Are these events the result of the lovers actions or despite them?  The film, to me, doesn't give a satisfactory answer.  This is no fault of McGregor and Green whose scenes together have a charged eroticism.  Ultimately, though, \"Perfect Sense\" is an interesting film that falls short of greatness."
B006UAWH2S Presently, science fiction is undergoing a bit of a renaissance in theatres.  There's been a trend for a number of years now to produce films which have stronger ties of very human messages.  With motion pictures like DISTRICT 9, MONSTERS, CLOVERFIELD, and even 2011's BATTLE: LOS ANGELES, writers and directors have been spinning tales about the increasing human cost to our sci-fi encounters with the unknown.  Some of them have focused more heavily on the action quotient, but, by these films' conclusions, there has been ample analysis of the risks to the `regular folks' when faced with the unknown, may it take the shape of aliens, monsters, or other organisms.  PERFECT SENSE continues in this same mold, upping the stakes for individuals.  This time around, it isn't aliens we're facing.  Instead, it's an inescapable virus.Two self-possessed young professionals - a gourmet chef (Ewan McGregor) and a epidemiologist (Eva Green) - find one another at the most trying time in human history: mankind is falling victim to a mysterious plague that robs us of our senses - one by one.  Can a cure for what ails them - the plague or their own narcissism - reach them in time?I won't spoil it, but I will say that PERFECT SENSE is a perfect winner of a film.  Its narration bobs and weaves back and forth between the standard linear - think any other story - and the documentary - scenes and images captured from the greater world at large.  The more we get to know our two principles, the more that's stripped away from them, only forcing us to understand them even more as they collectively lose their sense of smell, then taste, then hearing.  It's as much a cautionary tale as it is an old school romance - boy-meets-girl, boy-gets-girl, boy-loses-girl, but aren't they fated to find one another again? - is the best possible sense.  McGregor and Green's performances are comfortable and measured, especially when they're at the weakest - be it having one more layer of their humanity whisked away from them or when they're lost in one another's arms.  It's tragic and meaningful - sharp and resourceful - and, if you take it all to heart, you'll definitely come away with a tremendous appreciation for what smart science fiction looks like in the modern age.PERFECT SENSE is a product of IFC FILMS and BBC FILMS with participation from Zentropa Entertainments 5, the Danish Film Institute, Film I Vast, Bord Scannan Na Heireann / the Irish Film Board, and Sigma Films.  The script is from Kim Fupzaakeson, and it's directed with great attention to detail by David Mackenzie.  It all looks and sounds grand here, though I'll admit that I had to crank the volume quite a way up through part of Green's narrated voiceovers; I don't know if it was a fault of the original recording track or the fact that perhaps it was mixed noticeably lower than the rest of the piece.  Sadly, the disc only contains two features - a making-of short (2 minutes long?) and the trailer - and I would've definitely loved to have much, much more by way of commentaries and longer documentaries, giving more insight into this very special film.HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION.  Poignant and relevant, PERFECT SENSE will challenge you to think about your life and the greater world around you in ways you may never have before, and it just might have you clinging to that special someone, lingering a few extra moments in her embrace or her scent if for no other reason than for it to remain fresh in your mind.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at IFC Films provided me with a DVD screener copy of PERFECT SENSE for the expressed purposes of completing this review."
B006UAWH2S Susan is a scientist who lives in her own little world, her entire life is devoted to research, while everything else is neglected. For Susan, it was all work and no play, until she meets Michael. A talented scientist meets a talented chef, and the sizzling romance begins. As one would expect, Susan's life begins to change, but so does the entire world she lives in. The more steamy the relationship, the more a new epidemic spreads. As the couple fall in love and share their feelings, people all around lose their sensory perception. As the romance become intense, the mysterious disease becomes more disturbing. The outcome is global chaos as the mystery continues. \"PERFECT SENSE\" is brilliant, powerful, romantic, and chilling. The acting is superb, and the story is both touching and thrilling. Highly recommended for romantic suspense lovers and thriller loves."
B006UAWH2S There are interesting ideas in \"Sense,\" and the performances are uniformly excellent, as is everything from the sets to the musical score, but I found it ponderous, pretentious, and ultimately unappealing.  Another reviewer said it's hard to categorize, and that's true, although not necessarily a bad thing.  Pressed to find a category in which to put \"Sense,\" I list it withChildren of MenandBlindness, which to my mind were both superior films to this one.  I think what \"Perfect Sense\" might have been TRYING to be more like isNever Let Me Go, which is in every way better than \"Perfect Sense.\"  If you haven't seen \"Never Let Me Go\" yet and have a choice between that and this--do yourself a favor and go with \"Never.\"  (But if you're in the mood for sluggish sensuality and diffuse prettiness, you could do much worse than \"Perfect Sense\"--if you can stand being merely engaged rather than rapt, it will do.)"
B006UAWH2S Confession: I will view nearly any film, no matter how badly done, with apocalyptic themes. Most are way over the top, even for an admittedly over the top, end of world genre.But Perfect Sense transcends the form and surprised me. It WON'T be for you if non-stop gore, suspense, and action are what you crave.This lovely film is as much a meditation about being human as it is a call to wake up and appreciate what we have. These messages arrive in a story about a strange illness. Symptoms include waves of sadness, followed by the loss of smell..and then other symptoms.Perhaps \"perfect sense\" consists of coming to our senses before we truly lose them - or, at least, that is a major point I took away from this movie.Besides the epidemic, there is also a love story, a tumultuous attraction between a chef, Michael, and Susan, an epidemiologist. Their chemistry didn't quite click for me but this didn't take much away from the rest of the film. There is just so much worth pondering.I am grateful that so many of the usual and easy themes were omitted: no religious cause for the virus, no clear medical analysis. Viewers have to take events as they come and draw their own conclusions rather than being beaten over the head with a MAJOR POINT or PROFOUND MESSAGE."
B006UAWH2S There doesn't seem to be any shortage of end of the world films these days.  Add this Euro (Sweden, Denmark, Ireland, and Scotland) collaboration to the mix.  Don't look for alien invaders from another galaxy or robotic killers or even interplanetary collisions however.Set in Glasgow, scientists have discovered that a group of people are, for some unknown reason, losing their sense of smell.  The disease, presumed to be viral, spreads quickly worldwide.  What is even more unusual is that just before the ability to smell ceases, the victims go through a psychological change.  In this case, uncontrollable grief along with incessant sobbing.  Once that period ends the ability to smell goes as well.Eva Green plays Susan, an epidemiologist who is working on the identification process.  Her apartment overlooks the back door of an upscale restaurant where Michael (Ewan McGregor) is the chef.  Both are coming off badly ended relationships, but of course manage to hook-up.  What do you expect, they're both great looking.  While their relationship becomes hotter, so does the virus.  One by one, new psychological symptoms arrive with increasingly devastating effects.  The movie is far from perfect as some of the scenes seem out of context.  For example, even without a sense of taste, I doubt I'd want to be ingesting soap and shaving cream just for a few bathtub chuckles.Although the movie has sadness about it and a bleak forecast, Susan and Michael's love story is both erotic and hopeful.  Certainly a thinking person's sci-fi.  Recommended.The Blu ray disc has little to offer in terms of extras.  The transfer has a 2.34:1 aspect ratio nearly the same as the original print and is of course 1080p.  While the picture isn't reference quality it is likely close to the original.  Several scenes appear to be stock newsreel footage in standard definition.  I believe this was shot with digital cameras.  Some scenes look a little dark b
B006UAWH2S it was a bit strange of a perspective,  so definitely see this as a cult movie, or a niche taste."
B006UAWH2S Of all the movies that I have viewed this year, this one has to be up there with the best. The amazing direction of David Mackenzie, the lulling and mournful soundtrack by Max Richter and the photography by Giles Nuttgens (both beautiful and distressing combined) pull a metaphorical statement from beginning to end.Michael (Ewan McGregor) is an executive chef who meets Susan (Eva Green), a saddened epidemiologist, after she returns home from examining a patient with a very disturbing affliction.  Inexplicable, as he suddenly lost his sense of smell for no apparent reason.  This continues on to several other people at first then runs amok.These two begin an intimate relationship quite rapidly, as everything in this movie happens quickly and without warning with one exception: each person will fall into a severe emotional occurrence previous to losing their ability to smell.Susan and her team give it the name 'Severe Olfactory Syndrome' (SOS) as it reaches epidemic proportions and spreads world wide.  There are no explanations given as there is no time, therefore one must think on their own of how, why or what is happening.  The movie heavily affects your time in reacting.  It causes suspenseful anxiety to build readily and rapidly as you are left questioning the reasons why.The erotic relationship between Michael and Susan hardly gets a chance to develop, as the rapid-fire affliction follows into another sense (taste) and similarly eradicates it.  Michael is 'affected' and this is devastating to his career as is Susan affected also.  The couple is growing more and more dependent on each other as the happenings around them are mercurial and deconstructing.The symptoms preceding the loss of the senses are bewildering, wonder-struck and deeply disturbing.  People are losing control, panicking  and literally start unstoppable eating of anything and everything (from lipstick to things you have got to see for yourself).  The photography and camera angles get increasingly confusing while bringing this chaos to life; it is all out catastrophic.People are running wild, rioting in the streets as everything is unsafe and sickness is omnipresent.  There is so much to this movie that I wouldn't want to go on with the plot any longer as I would hate to ruin anyone's response to this movie...and your response itself is everything.Running amid the course of the film are short plugged in narratives that work well.  They serve to make you think, as this is a frightening portrait of annihilation in a very different form.When someone loses one of their senses, it is usually just that one and devastating enough alone.  The ending of this movie presents a whole alternative view to this, as tomorrow is no guarantee and \"gather ye rosebuds while ye may\"."
B006UAWH2S A story about virus that takes away your senses seems a little corny perhaps but this film is anything but that. It has great performances from both leads and some great cinematography. I don't think the film had a big budget but you can't tell as they used their money very well to make a great atmospheric film. You can feel the depression in every frame as society tries to cope as they lose their senses one by one. The main love story between Eva Green and Ewen Mcgregor is well done and realistic. It's not the corny type love affair in some films. It feels real and natural and the two have great chemistry on screen. The ending may not please all but I thought it was a brilliant closing scene. I find myself thinking about the film far after I watched it which is quite rare for me. I recommend this to fans of either apocalyptic end of the world or romance dramas as it is equal parts both."
B006UAWH2S \"I think it's OK to panic now.\" A very serious disease strain has begun to cause havoc all over the world and it's called severe olfactory syndrome (SOS). It begins by smelling something that reminds you of someone you know who has died, then one by one you begin to lose your senses. During the outbreak chef Michael (McGregor) and scientist Susan (Green) begin to fall in love and their relationship is tested over and over as their senses begin to fail. Even the the plot may sound a little hokey this is actually a very good movie. At once the movie is both disturbing and sweet as well as erotic. The acting is fantastic as you believe that they are really losing their senses and you really begin to feel bad for them. To me this is a little scary because it makes me wonder if this could actually happen (from some chemical) and how I would act. This movie will give you hope and break your heart at the same time. I recommend this but it is a movie that will leave you worn out and not really in the mood to do anything after. Overall, a very good movie that is both disturbing and wonderful. I give it a B+."
B006UAWH2S Set in Glasgow, \"Perfect Sense\" follows the story of a chef Michael (Ewan McGregor) and an epidemiologist Susan (Eva Green) falling in love with other just when a strange epidemic spreads all over the world, depriving the people of the sense of smell. Things don't stop there, but people are resilient, as the film's voiceover says, \"life goes on.\"This is a sci-fi romance with an unusual premise, or a modern-day parable beautifully-shot and well-acted, with a positive message about life, something that is also thought-provoking ... if you can ignore the film's pretentious and manipulative narrative.While director David Mackenzie manages to visualize the impending apocalypse effectively with minimum use of props, there is something artificial about the way the whole story is told. What if you lose your sense of smell? Pretty early on you will know where the film is trying to lead us to. \"Perfect Sense\" certainly does what it sets out to do confidently, even though I really don't care what is going on in this alternative universe of the emotionally distant film.Like some art house movies, \"Perfect Sense\" makes a point of showing what is obvious in a novel way."
B006UAWH2S Imagine losing your senses one by one, how terrifying it would be, and the repercussions of not having the sense of smell, taste, hearing, and sight.  That is the epidemic depicted in this existential horror/dystopian film, where many, if not all, people in the world are afflicted.  We focus on the relationship between an epidemiologist and a chef who are both infected and go through the rigors of the illness with each other.  There is no explanation of what causes the problem, which adds to the tension."
B006UAWH2S PLOT SPOILER ALERT!I don't get the 4 and 5 star reviews.  Is this depressing film an apocalyptic fable, or a cautionary tale, or \"when the world comes to an end, you still have each other and your love\"?  Perhaps the first two, definitely not the last \"love\" scenario. As far as leaving the theater and being filled with life, someone spiked your Pepsi.If the director & writer were intending to do a somewhat realistic film, and not a fantasy, then they failed.  They have given us a virus that first knocks out your sense of smell, then taste, then hearing, then sight, and finally (not shown in the film) your sense of touch.  \"Love\" as an outward display of affection, is non-existent in a world where you cannot smell, taste, hear, see, or touch the one you love.  It is not the \"Perfect Sense\", it is not even a sense.  What is left is a feeling/emotion called \"love\" that was derived from the senses, and absent the five senses becomes a memory.The logical conclusion of this movie is that the human population becomes extinct.  Each person dies because of starvation or suicide, alone -- probably in fear.  After that, there is not even the memory of \"love\" on this planet.  The only way our two protagonists could have ended this tragic movie with \"love\", was if -- while they still had their sense of touch -- they took cyanide and hugged and kissed good-bye.I gave this film 3 stars because Ava Green is worth watching in any film.  She does her best acting when she has no make-up on.  (Bet you thought I was going to say something else.)This is not a film you will watch more than once."
B006UAWH2S This is a apocalyptic movie about a strange virus that is destroying the senses of humans one by one. However, humans quickly adapt and move on with their everyday life.Eva Green is absolutely fantastic (as a statistician working in an hospital) in her role like in all movies that she appeared (Cracks is my favorite for the moment). I wish she would appear in more movies.While many people may not like the movie, from a scientific point it makes sense that a virus can and may be one day infect a particular cell population in the brain that is responsible for our senses.We have officially five senses: Sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch. It is quite amazing how the movie demonstrates the adaptability of humans. Once a sense disappears, after a few weeks of panic, people adapt and move on with their life. That is probably the best part of the movie, beside the love story between Eva Green and Ewan McGregor.The movie is well done and while it is focusing on the two love birds, we get the message of adaptability.Without being a spoiler, four of the senses disappear during the movie and the one not gone by the time the movie is over (touch) is the most intriguing of all. Once I got into the movie, I was expecting to see what would be the consequences of losing the touch feeling. We will never know since the movie doesn't tell us but we can guess many different scenarios.Great movie, five stars all around for everything!"
B006UJVOPA I like the saltiness of Vera and the fact she isn't a skinny, young blond!  Her sidekick supplies the eye candy and the gentleness that is lacking in Vera's character.  Definitely worth watching."
B006UJVOPA The name and photo for the program kept me from watching it. Glad I got past it. Love the plots and twists and turns. Good character development. Beautiful cinematography of the landscapes. Makes me want to go there."
B006UJVOPA I absolutely can't get enough of the Vera series and hope it continues for a long, long time. I first found it on _____ and had a wonderful marathon, have since found more series here on Amazon Prime - yay!For those of us who love quiet escapism, this is a series for us. Dark, moody, atmospheric, soulful bits of music enhance scenes (rather than overpowering to compensate for a lack of content). Beautifully well done._________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Oh my gosh, for those of you who dislike dark, moody and atmospheric, stay away from the fabulously dark and wet set-in-Seattle series: The Killing - it's FABULOUS for those attributes! I have no self control and sat and watched an entire season in two days and now have to wait a whole year until they produce the third season - aughh. Oh, well...I can always watch again starting from Season 1, Episode 1 - it's a twisty, turny I-KNOW-who-did-it, but aha! - I never do!__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________I live in the US and here are some of the British series I watch with a delighted eye for the extra added bonus of VISUAL CONTENT of countryside, village life, clothing, decor, lifestyle, just plain charm (aside from, or in addition to actual story, characters or content) I'm not one who goes for the opulent high class loads of money castles, etc. unless they're land rich, cash poor old manors slightly dilapidated and interesting:Poirot: Very clean, stark and precise Art Deco - a totally different feel from my other favorites, but just as enjoyable visually - excellent attention to detail!Midsomer Murders has mostly beautiful, blue skies with high white clouds, rolling green fields, absolutely charming cottages and villages. So many places I'd love to see in person. [Unfortunately, I can't stand the characters of Tom's whiny wife and smug daughter.] Light series despite all the murders and boy howdy there are many, lol! I also love the long length of these.Doc Martin: beautiful, seaside village life! Blue skies, green hills and fields, narrow lanes, delightful cottages and short ceilinged century old houses. I want to live there.Ballykissangel: same as above and I want to live there, too. Cute little old, old, old, cottages."
B006UJVOPA who manages to solve crimes in her own way. Nevertheless, she gets the job done with few outbreaks of bossiness and a staff that seems to respect her methods."
B006UJVOPA Pay attention while watching this one. The pace seems slow at first, but moves along. Hope Netflix adds Season 2."
B006UJVOPA I love this series.  She's different - emotional, but doesn't want anyone to know it  Her assistant is absolutely delicious.  He deals with her well.  I want to see more of her."
B006UJVOPA Just wished there were more to watch.  I have always liked Brenda Blethyn.  British detective and mysteries are my favorite .  I saw season 1 on PBS so I had to watch it again."
B006UJVOPA WHAT AN AWESOME SHOW!!! I LOVE British drama series...AND THIS SHOW  IS IT! IT'S A GREAT WAY TO SPEND AN EVENING."
B006UJVOPA As an American, there is more about British culture that I don't totally get than I would have thought.  Of course I have no idea how &#34;real&#34; this show is, but it is fascinating to watch - to observe the differences.  Characters are well developed, and brilliantly acted.  The mysteries keep you guessing.  What more could you ask for?"
B006UJVOPA There is always a twist.  Vera is a dogmatic inspector with a very sharp brain.  I anxiously anticipate Season 3."
B006UJVOPA I enjoyed these stories and Vera's wry sense of humor.  Please continue with Season two for me to enjoy soon."
B006UJVOPA I Love British detective stories and Vera is very real. Her emotions are all over the place and she does remind me of Colombo. The cast is great and I like all of it."
B006UJVOPA I'm hooked.  Vera is so quirky you never know what she'll say next.  She has a hunk of a side kick, the scenery is amazing and the whole thing is done very well."
B006UJVOPA This program is ok but too slow moving for me.  I thought it was a waste of my time watching Vera when I could be watching something else."
B006UJVOPA A 50-something woman detective takes charge in this series. The accent is a bit difficult, so you might wish to turn on Closed Captioning. A delightful change from the young, virile copper, although no where near as easy on the eyes!"
B006UJVOPA I like that you cannot predict what's going to happen next, nor how the story will end. Interesting characters, not the 'made in the mould' cops like so many shows. The characters here have admirable qualities and rough edges at the same time, just like real people do. I really like Brenda Blethyn as Vera. She is excellent."
B006UJVOPA now that she has a good group the dci will be able to solve any case that comes along  enjoy"
B006UJVOPA This may be a promising, interesting series but the accents are so pronounced, it is irritating to try to watch since I don't understand half of what is said....not a good idea on series needing to figure &#34;who dun it!&#34;"
B006UJVOPA Good show, worth watching particularly if you come from the northeast of England because you see some places you have never seen before...well I did!."
B006UJVOPA What I said in season 2, I also mean for season 1. As I said, great mystery with these crimes."
B006UJVOPA What an excellent show where the writers have an ensemble interaction, young and old, down to perfection with acting to fulfill the writing!  Vera and Joe have got it going on in such a bizarre, cantankerous wonderful kinda way with excellent support from Holly and Kennie!"
B006UJVOPA Vera, is down to earth and well written. the only down side is not a lot of episodes, but that is a good thing. I would spend my day watching and not doing much else"
B006UJVOPA Super acting on the part Ms Blethyn as well as those of her co-stars.  Also, the characters were quite convincing."
B006UJVOPA What a fun show.Like someone else said, an English Columbo.The story's are good as are the characters.Enjoy."
B006UJVOPA The only complaint I really had was the difficulty of streaming the first episode.  Brenda Blethyn makes the series.  Even though she tries to remain detached, she simply can't help herself from caring about her staff and those close to the victims.  I would recommend this to mystery lovers and I am definitely left with wanting more!"
B006UJVOPA I've seen Brenda Blethyn in several British films and her ability to absorb herself into her characters is almost frightening.  It would be wonderful to sit down with her to find out what she's really like.  In this series, she is an introverted detective, with almost no people skills except when she's interacting with victims and suspects; then she can be utterly kind, patient and understanding until she's gotten what she needs to solve the crime.  Yet, there is something in the character and the performance that makes you long to understand her.  Some clues as to how she became who is is, are given when she speaks of her distant and difficult father, with whom she had a troubled relationship.  Over the series they seem to be revealing more about her youth.  The mysteries are well done, very much character driven and always contain surprising elements and twists that are frequently based on both victims' and perpetrators' inability to understand and cope with each other, their own desires and life itself.Vera's relationship with her team is also interesting; she can bellow with the best of them, but there is some kindness there when she's reminded that these people are human.  Her relationsip with her her right arm, John, is fascinating.  Initially he cannot get a handle on her personality but when he does he manages to work with her and even understand her.  When Vera attends his daughter's first communion he quietly hands her a gift to give to the child since he knows it simply will not occur to her to do so. In a scene where she has reluctaintly agreed to have dinner with his family, she sits across from his wife and looks so absolutely at sea, totally unable to cope with a simple dinner that it is painful to watch and she abruptly ends the meal and leaves; stunning acting.  Lovely, well done complex stories and I hope to see more."
B006UJVOPA This is a different kind of detective and I enjoyed the series.  It took a little getting used to her, but she grew on me and the characters grow, too"
B006UJVOPA Really enjoyed this show.  Vera is a believable character.I was hooked after the first episode.  Her partner is also a good character."
B006UJVOPA I'm enjoying the stories and the acting is good.  It is a bit hard to understand the accent and follow what's going on at times.  But, I do look forward to watching more of this season.  It's nice to see a series that is more about solving the mystery of the case than about sex appeal.  Also nice that there is no vulgar language.  I love the main character, Vera."
B006UJVOPA I love almost all detective stories, I enjoyed all of the Vera series..better than reading a book. Wish there were more like this."
B006UJVOPA Love Vera and all her flaws.  She manages to pursue and persist until she is on the right track and solves the mystery with the help of her co-workers.  Stories are not cookie cutter but the theme is original and well written."
B006UJVOPA It is not so easy to successfully create thrillers then an entire series around a frumpy middle aged woman detective who is frequently in a bad mood. However the Brits score once again, and I think that is why we are so deeply drawn into this series - we can identify with characters who are normal, have issues and are not glammed up.As Vera Stanhope, Brenda Blethyn is superb--she's a woman with little private life, obsessed by her work, and often very hard on her subordinates -and yet underneath all her spikiness, she has a great deal of feeling and compassion. Additionally the Northumbrian setting provides a moody cloud filled change from the usual urban grit or typically bucolic English village.The episodes themselves are fascinating--topical, character driven and complex without the over the top guns, chases and bravado of much American television programming. I read that series three has already aired in Britain and series four is being filmed. I can hardly wait."
B006UJVOPA Season 1 is very consistent in its characterization and drama; well written series. I enjoy Vera because she is so OCD; a difficult woman with a difficult past who finds loving and forgiving very difficult. Her relationship with Joe, her sergeant is more clear in the second season as Joe's family is brought into the drama. For now, Joe is a forever forgiving, over-worked father of a young family who is trying desperately to keep up with his irritating boss.  Delightful"
B006UJVOPA Vera is doggedly determined to find answers but doesn't know how to manage people.  Maybe that's because she has so many worries of her own that she won't share with anyone.  All of the officers - even the quiet ones - impact the show.  The countryside is beautiful and the evil is truly human evil.  Hope to find more of Brenda Blethyn's shows."
B006UJVOPA Though it was interesting was a little confusing, bounced around too much, hard to keep up an interest in the story"
B006UJVOPA The characters are complex, the stories unpredictable: everything you want in a good mystery series!  There are layers of story lines going on in each episode with natural dialogue and excellent actors."
B006UJVOPA the fact us that many homicide detectives are in fact overweight. they eat a lot due to the horror of their job.  Vera is also having health problems and the stress of her job  , is  ready to boil up. She explodes a lot ,but she cares and everyone that works for her knows it and respect her even if she is a hard person to work for. She also lets her emotions boil up in stressful situations. But she gets the job done. And the first season has four well done episodes. Each over a hour long. We need a show like this , as much as I love csi and such , this dogged detective work is  what most detectives have to go through.  This is a great show and it's a drama , with little action but that's ok. the picture looks great, in hd.  I don't think it's out on dvd yet in the states, but it's getting more and more fans  , so it will probably happen."
B006UJVOPA We caught 'Vera' merely by chance when scrolling for something decent to watch. Since we are avid Brenda Blethyn fans, we knew it had to be good, and we certainly were not disappointed. She is so very good at the dry/droll/snarky quips...hard to beat 'Vera' for great entertainment!"
B006UJVOPA I really like the stories and the actors are a great ensemble cast.  The writing is creative and Vera played by Brenda Blethyn is entertaining.  A nice detective story that you can involve yourself in.  Vera can get a little on your nerves and she over acts at times, but the actor David Leon has just the right touch to ground the show and bring it back into reality.  Loved both seasons."
B006UJVOPA I really enjoyed this series! Just enough personal interaction to make the show work. Even though one member of the cast changed, the show still went on with the usual great acting. I would recommend you watch it!"
B006UJVOPA Nothing really wrong with this show it just didn't really keep my attention.  I think I started doing something else before it finished."
B006UJVOPA Only watched one episode but it was good.  Just haven't gotten around to watching more.  &#34;Vera&#34; is a bit of a selfish character but she gets the job done."
B006UJVOPA Fabulous acting.  I forgot where I was, enthralled by great acting, story line and wonderful scenes of England.  Highly recommend the series.  Wish there were more seasons to watch.  Please.  Please."
B006UJVOPA I enjoyed this series very much. It was a welcome change from the rough and tumble series I just completed (The Commander-it was also very good). The setting and soundtrack was pleasing - I was almost transported! I loved how the lead was a bit of a grumblely-gus and everyone fawned for her approval. A welcome change having a woman in a role where she bucked norms of this genre."
B006UJVOPA The stories aren't bad, its the principal character that's the pain.  Granted it is season 1 and everyone is trying to find their feet.But, Vera is bad tempered all the time and borderline abusive.  The series is as much to do about Vera and her quirks as it is thesolving of crime.  If you like police stories where the DCI is a misery guts, then this is for you.  I prefer my stories with a lot more class like &#34;Lewis&#34;.  You can't go wrong with &#34;Lewis&#34;!"
B006UJVOPA Blethyn's characterization is marvelous as a down-to-earth, sometimes cranky detective with little life outside her job. The accents are sometimes hard to decipher, but watch this enough and they'll clarify; even when I was struggling with the individual words, I loved the melodic sounds. Good mysteries, very enjoyable."
B006UJVOPA I like this series.  It is quite different from the usual British detective series.  Vera is quirky, smart, and not at all glamorous, but she is relentless in crime solving.  A  refreshing,satisfying series."
B006UJVOPA I love Brenda Blethyn in this part. He character's behavior is odd, but intriguing. You get to know the characters and their issues as the stories develop. I like that this mystery series is about the mystery and not just the action, although there is some action in the stories.."
B006UJVOPA I liked Vera because she's unglamorous and real.  I like her working relationship with Sgt. Joe, who seems to be a devoted family man.  Vera is tough and cynical, but really cares about &#34;her&#34; victims.  The dialogue is a little difficult to understand for an American, but I listened closely and enjoyed the mystery."
B006UJVOPA The characters and setting for the show are fabulous. The scenery is beautiful and the intensity of each episode is gripping. Great watch!"
B006UJVOPA I am looking forward to more of the back story of the character Vera.  Well acted and well written. There is a great contrast between the ugly crimes being investigated and beautiful scenery."
B006UJVOPA This is a superb who-done-it type show.  The outdoor views are unique and beautiful.  There's just enough curiosity about the main characters to make you care about them.  It's very high quality that you're likely to enjoy."
B006UJVOPA This woman is an unlikely lead in a series, but delightful to watch in all her complexities.  An interesting series that combines the sensitive with the humorous.  Well worth watching."
B006UJVOPA Quite a good show - love the personalities and how they interplay --- just wish there were more seasons and more episodes."
B006V644AO It keeps my three year old daughter's attention.  She loves the action and she actually follows along with their adventures with no problem."
B006V644AO I choose this rating because my grandson learnedSo much from team oomizoomi. Shapes, counting,And one to one correspondence(educational term)I forgot pattern. My other grandson watched team oomizoomiAnd is at the top of his class in math. It makes math fun."
B006V644AO My 2 year old loves this little group and I love its educational aspect. This is her favorite episode and we wanted to have it on the Kindle anytime."
B006V644AO I don't like it but the kids do and they learn to find things or put things together or count. it's just annoying to me. the voices, the characters especially door mouse who is always negative."
B006V644AO This cartoon is so much fun to watch.  My grandchild enjoys the 'plot', music, colors, shapes, and the business of the characters!  It's entertaining and a good learning tool for shapes, designs/colors, and measurements for toddlers.  Strongly recommend it, you won't regret purchasing it for your child or children."
B006V644AO We bought a few favorite episodes and will probably buy the season when it comes out in full. We often use them traveling and sometimes at home. The show has been great. She has learned ALL her shapes and numbers from it. How many almost 2 year olds know a trapezoid when the see it? Or how to count to 100 by ones AND tens? The only downside is she can have a day when she overstresses about everything (toddler much?) and too many OH NOs from bot and it'll be time to stop it before she cries over nothing."
B006VA3X9I A nice twist on the pawn star series that seems to be all over television. It is amazing how many different ways these guys do business."
B006VA3X9I The owners/employees are entertaining to watch.  They seem like good, genuine folks from down South.  An interesting spin in this show is that many of the customers seem to know the owner, so it adds a much more personal feel to those encounters.  I think that makes this reality show seem even more real.  They buy a good mix of items, from Civil War memorabilia to donkeys to honey.  These shows are best when there is an educational piece in every episode.  You get that with Cajun Pawn Stars.  It's entertaining and educational.  You often see failed negotiations, which I assume is reality on an everyday occasion.  I can appreciate that as much as successful negotiations."
B006VA3X9I Feeling folksy?  If History's smash hit \"Pawn Stars\" is too urbane for you with its Las Vegas setting, you might want to try something with a little more twang.  \"Cajun Pawn Stars\" could be just that program, but I'm not sure if this version has quite the instant appeal.  I know there is a contingent of viewers who love this much more than the original, and I know there are vocal opponents who find this edition far less real and/or compelling.  For myself, I fall somewhere in between.  The show is caught between being a rip-off and a spin-off.  It wants to adhere so closely to the winning formula that defined \"Pawn Stars\" that, especially in early episodes, the drama can seem incredibly forced.  As the season progresses and you get to know the cast, the interactions start to feel more organic--but it's still a show that has yet to find its own voice and viewpoint.Set in Alexandria, Louisiana at the Silver Dollar Pawn and Jewelry Center, the colorful proprietor is Jimmie \"Big Daddy\" DeRamus.  His brother and his daughter are among the other regulars and the show hopes to capitalize on wacky family interactions.  As you might expect, there is much down home humor to be gleaned from Big Daddy, his family, his staff, and those that visit the shop.  Some works, some feels strained.  To me, the star of the show (at least initially) is the massive shop itself that seems to have every manner of merchandise crammed into its corners and crevices.  It would be a fascinating place to visit and poke through, that's for sure.Season One is comprised of 8 episodes on one disc for just shy of three hours worth of total programming.  There are no special features, but the disc offers Spanish and English subtitles.  Here are the included shows:(1) Donkeys and Dollars, (2) Sweet and Sour, (3) Shoeshine Mike, (4) Money Bzzzzness, (5) Joker's Big Score, (6) Trick or Trade, (7) Joker's Wild, and (8) Speed Demons.As I've said, the show seems to have divided people.  You might want to sample an episode on rerun before you buy the season (they are also available on-demand here if you don't have the History Channel).  I love the shop, I haven't fallen in love with the show yet.  It has potential, though, as long as it keeps pushing to establish its own individuality.  KGHarris, 8/12."
B006VA3X9I Great variety of items pawned. Hard to believe the money people loose because they want money NOW! You can learn a lot about the history of the South in this one."
B0016N7IJ6 I am a huge fan of these placemats.  They are not smelly and plasticky and do the job.  They seem to hold up well with lots of food smeared all over them.  I would love the stickem to be a bit more tacky but we make it work.  They are also biodegradeable and affordable.
B0016N7IJ6 We've used these several times when going out to restaurants with the kids. They work really well and keep the kids occupied while we wait for the food. The only thing I don't really like is that if the kids put their food on the placemat, they can sometimes get crayon in their food! But it's either that or they put their food directly on the table, which may or may not be clean. The adhesive stays put during the meal and comes off easily. They're priced well and worth the time to use. I'd recommend them!
B0016N7IJ6 We picked some of these up at Babies R Us and we love them.  My son is now 2 years old but we've been using these since he started eating solid food.  Their biggest advantage is that (unlike Table Toppers) they are meant to color on and they are big.  I also like that they are made of paper and not plastic.Previously we had usedNeat Solutions Baby Einstein Biodegradable Table Topper Disposable Stick-on Placemat 30-Count.  These Classy Kid placemats are much better than the Table Toppers for a number of reasons.These placemate are wonderful because they:-  have adhesive on all four sides of the placemat (Table Topper only has adhesive on top and bottom sides).-  are big and cover a nice size area; pretty much all the area a young toddler can reach from his high chair.-  are made to go over the edge of the table.  So if your kids likes to play with the edge of the table or even tries to chew on the edge of the table these placemats have you covered.-  Best of all these are made to color on.  They come with a pack of triangular crayons.  My son loves to color these.  It has saved us a lot of trouble when food is taking a long time to come out.-  have different settings with either farm animals, or jungle animals, or undersea creatures on them.  It gives you lots to talk about with your toddler and lots to color!We will continue to use these placemats as long as my son continues to eat food off the table.  He's getting better at using a plate but still.  We really have not found anything better than these.  Although they are a bit hard to find you can either buy them online or at Babies R Us.
B0016N7IJ6 If you take your kids to eat out you have to get these placemats! They are the best out there.Pros:They are huge! They cover every part of the table your child will touch including the side of the table!The pictures they have to color are fun and entertain my daughterThey come with crayons! Which is great into its self but not only that they are triangle shaped crayons so they don't roll off the tableThey also are easy to store in my diaper bagCons:The only con is that the bottom part that is supposed to stick on the table is not as sticky as it could be. The rest sticks fine but the bottom one you have to press very firmly to begin with and also during the meal depending on how long we stay we end up pressing two more times but its not that big of a deal because most placemats out there don't even have the option to cover the side of the table. Anyways I highly recommend this product.
B0016N7IJ6 I love these placemats. It's easy to peel off adhesives and stick these to a table. The adhesive sticks fairly well. When very determined my little one can pull up the adhesive, but it actually re-sticks pretty well. I appreciate that these are are disposable and biodegradeable. We don't use these at home, but do use them when eating out to allow our little one to eat off the table without worrying about germs! My older daughter no longer needs these, but sometimes asks to use them to color on, which can be a welcomed distractions. These are one of my favorite kid products!
B0016N7IJ6 This has been one of the few 'convenience' baby items that has really lived up to expectations. They are so easy to keep in the diaper bag (unlike some non-disposable place mats that inevitably get taken out because they take up so much room) and unfold into a nice big rectangle.They are very waterproof - we are always pleased to find that when we peel up the place mat and it doesn't show any signs of falling apart or leaking through. However, even though they may get covered in water and other liquids, we were surprised to find that we were still able to color on them. Even though my son is not yet 16 months, we can keep him entertained for at least a couple of minutes with coloring on the mats and talking about the different animals and plants depicted on them. The crayons that come with the mats are triangular shaped so that they do not roll off the table - another bonus. Ours included a red, blue, green and yellow crayon. They do have a bit of a waxy feel to them, but we haven't tried our Crayola crayons on the mats yet to see if they are more or less compatible with them. I will update the review if we get around to it.As an extra bonus, I don't feel the guilt that I would if I purchased the plastic place mats because they are biodegradable.If there was any kids of negative, it would be that sometimes the adhesive backing strips on the bottom may be the teeniest tiniest hard to peel off. Just a warning if you have terrible hand dexterity or hand-eye coordination... Once peeled off and placed down, the mat has always stayed down - even covering the table edge (which my man sometimes still likes to bite down on at times.)Fabulous product!
B0016N7IJ6 They're huge, they glue down on all four sides, the images give me and my daughter something to talk about during lunches out, and they're biodegradable. What more can you ask for?
B0016NHN82 quality is not good, it had a little hole on it and I just unpacked in the the bathroom and use it right it way there.
B0016NHN82 My baby loves this inflatable tub!  When she was able to sit up, we started using it.  She sits more securely in it without sliding all over the whole bathtub. I love how it has a little loop holder on the back side of the tub for hanging. I use a shower curtain hook to hook through the loop holder on the inflatable tub and hang it on the towel rack in my shower. Convenient!  It's sturdy material and has remained inflated with no leaking.  I wish this tub had been available years ago when my other children were babies!  Overall - one of the best essential buys I've made for my baby.
B0016NHN82 Those plastic newborn tubs just won't cut it around the 6 month mark. Filling up a full-sized tub on a nightly basis is a waste of water. The Safety 1st Kirby Inflatable Tub is a perfect in-between. It allows for a deep bathing experience without using much water. It is a tight fit in the bathtub, but not unworkable. Blowing it up is a pain in the neck, but once it is blow up you only need to top it off every so often. I could care less about how it is decorated, so if esthetics is important to you hopefully another review can fill that need. This is a great tub and should be a registry essential.
B0016NHN82 Love this tub. It fits perfectly in my shower stall (since I don't have a bath tub) and my 7 month old LOVES it. The bottom gets kind of slippery so he slips backwards but if you had a foam pad it would work perfectly in the bottom. I have no issues with this at all.
B0016NHN82 I purchased this item to put in our camper.  We only have a shower in there and I needed a way to bathe my child when she was a baby.  We used it from the time she was 4 months old to the time she was 20 months old.  She got too big for it them and was used to being in the shower with me by then.  This tub stored very easily for travel, was easy to clean, easy to fill with water and was easy to drain.  My child loved using this tub.  She had room to play when she was smaller.  Toward the end, she didn't have room for her boats in there with her, but it served the purpose we bought it for.  We will certainly be saving it to use with our next child.
B0016NHN82 I have a 6 month old daughter who can sit up pretty well but still needs some support once in a while. She didn't seem to really enjoy the infant tub anymore because she doesn't like to recline long, and sitting up in her infant tub was kind of awkward for us to bathe her. We had started bathing her in the big tub with one of us in the tub with her, but it was a pain to fill the whole tub (even if it was shallow) every time, and to get in with her. This inflatable tub is the perfect in-between tub for us! It hardly takes any water to fill, but still stays warmer longer than the infant tub because it holds more water. It fits in the big tub with room for us to sit behind them in the tub or on the edge if we wanted without getting wet in the tub with her. It's soft for if she starts to topple over. And it's got a slight texture so it's not just slippery plastic. A bonus for her is that her bath toys can't get too far away from her. =) The one thing is something I had read in another review: because of the width of the walls, about half the water from the tub faucet ends up going down the drain when filling unless you use a cup or something to divert the water into the small tub. I'm currently looking for a faucet extender like thePrince Lionheart 2 Count Faucet Extender, Gray/PinkorAqueduck Faucet Extender, Aquaextenders that would work for a tub faucet (with a spout cover) instead of a normal sink faucet, but in the meantime, I found that using one of the cups we use to rinse her off does well to divert the water into the tub. Luckily, the tub fills so fast, I'm not sitting there holding the cup for long. =)
B0016NHN82 We love this baby bath! Our daughter is 8 months old and was starting to get too big for the hard plastic baby bath and yet not quite big enough or steady enough to go right into the bathtub, so this inflatable tub is the perfect transition! She absolutely loves it, it is fully enclosed and has a plug in the bottom and a hook that you can hang it up to dry inside the bath with! Couldn't have asked for anything better.
B0016NHN82 We used this tub for both our boys. I really liked how cushioned it was, and it was quite durable. The first one lasted about a year, and then we purchased another because we liked it so much. It wasn't the easiest to blow up, however.
B0016NHN82 We've been using this little tub for the past few months.  My son is now 9 months old and he still fits in it just fine.  I love it mainly because I don't have to worry about his bumping his head against the sides of the bathtub, and because it uses little water, I don't have to fill the whole bath tub with water and it's comfortable for him.  I would strongly recommend it to anyone with an infant that can sit up.
B0016NHN82 I use this for my 3 month old, we have been traveling a lot so the bulky infant tubs are not an option for us. We use this and it's great b/c it packs up in a suitcase easily and my son can lay in it with a little water. He enjoys it!
B0016NHN82 This is a very durable, high quality tub. I would definitely recommend this fine product as it's worth the price.
B0016NHN82 My 1-yr-old daughter HATED the regular tub when we tried to stop using the plastic infant tub.  Cried through every bath.  We bought this and she loves it.  We inflated it and let her play in it in the kitchen first (no water) and she climbed in and out over and over.  Once she was in the tub and in water, she splashed and played and just loved her bath again.  What a relief!  It's not very slippery on the bottom, either.  She suddenly got up on her hands and feet twice to turn herself around and didn't slip at all.
B0016NHN82 This is fabulous we have bought others in the past and none has lived up to our expectations other than this and I would recommend to anyone we bought for travel and it is so handy !
B0016NHN82 I chose this tub because the reviews said it was non-slip. They were absolutely true!!! My baby is starting to move around a lot and she has never slipped! I'm glad I bought this tub and didn't transition to adult tub from infant tub because she cried a little when i first put her in, but she got used to this tub fast. I don't ever deflate it. Ijust flip it over when done bathing to dry off.
B0016NMIOG We used this on a trip with our 11 month old daughter when we went overseas and it was exceptionally useful. The container is great and keeps things clean when you're traveling. We used these for a while even after our trip was over. At first Amazon or the company that sold it to us--by mistake sent us disposable spoons by accident but after notifying them of the mistake, either amazon or the company that sold the spoons sent us the correct product. Easy as pie and great service. Now that our daughter is 15ish month old she can't really use them anymore since it isn't deep enough to spoon a lot of food, but its ok...we still found these great when she was the appropriate age to use it.
B0016NMIOG Wasn't sure if I'd actually use these, but we find ourselves out and about and randomly stopping at restaurants or eating at friends' houses frequently, so I figured I'd try it.  Have to say, it is GREAT to just keep in the diaper bag and have handy for that.  Our toddler isn't quite old enough to be able to handle standard sized silverware yet, but these are small like the ones he uses at daycare.  Perfect to have at the ready, easy to clean, and the container keeps them clean and makes them easy to find in the diaper bag.  Every time I have whipped these out, I have received comments from friends that they have never seen anything like this and that it's such a great idea.  We originally bought because we'll be travelling to see family w/ no kids, and this will be perfect for that too.  Highly recommended as a diaper bag staple.
B0016NMIOG This travel set is helpful to keep in a diaper bag for a young kid who is just learning to use forks and spoons.  The flatware is a great size for kids' fingers, while the travel case keeps it handy and easy to find.  Then, as your child gets older, the case is the perfect size for a child's toothbrush and travel size toothpaste!
B0016NMIOG We have bought 5-6 different kinds of flatware for our toddler and the Take and Toss is our favorite.  I tend to buy the more expensive product thinking it will be superior.  For once, that is not the case.  The Take and Toss has no sharp metal so toddlers don't poke themselves while learning to maneuver their forks.  They are also the perfect size for a toddler's mouth.  It surprises me how wide some of the other flatware out there is.This travel set is my favorite!  It is on my list of must-have's and I add it to all by baby/shower gifts.  This lives in our diaper bag.  Not only is it handy to have when eating away from home, but it doubles as a toy until the food arrives.  My little guy loves shaking it and taking the utensils out and putting them back in, over and over.  It's small, cleans up easily, and is cheap to replace when a spoon accidentally gets buried under a pile of wet wipes.  Highly recommended!
B0016NMIOG i like all the dishes or silverware come with cases to keep clean for my son. it is convient for travelling or go out.
B0016NMIOG Got these for a recent family vacation. I love that the container keeps them contained - clean or dirty. When we came home these became a staple in our diaper bag.
B0016NMIOG I always carry these in my diaper bag when we go out for outings to the park or to eat out, and they come in very handy! The container is compact and holds just enough utensils, and keeps the utensil from soiling other items in your purse after use. The utensils are easy for my toddler to use, and I always wash and reuse them instead of tossing them. Because they are so inexpensive, it's not as much as a loss when I lose one of the utensils (which inevitably happens when you have a toddler). I boughtThe First Years Take & Toss Toddler Flatware, 16 Pieceas spare utensils to use at home and replace in the container.
B0016NMIOG Love these!  My 22 month old son loves to feed himself,and these are the perfect size for him.  I never toss them, just wash them in the dishwasher.  I love the carrying case, we put it in the diaper bag.
B0016NMIOG I bought this to keep in my diaper bag so I have child size silverware when we go somewhere. I love the case that it has. It beats having them in a plastic bag all the time! I've even pulled it out to entertain my child with. It can be used as a make shift rattle and my son loves to take the top on and off. Overall a great product!
B0016NP0ZA This thing held up GREAT... for like a week then it would never, ever stay stuck to the wall anymore. Which is a shame because the lady bug toy holder looked so cute and neat on the wall... but i refuse to drill holes. I WISH this would work like it says... but my lady bug just sits on the tub floor now after use.
B0016NP0ZA The Boon Bug Pod is a complete scam. I ordered the Boon Bug because I thought it was so cute, but when I finally got it, the only way to attach it to my tub was to drill into the wall. So I had to make another purchase of the suction cup bracket so make it work. What a rip off.
B0016NP0ZA I've used this on two different walls now. A fiberglass tub wall and a porcelain subway tile wall. It's worked great both times by following the instructions. I think one of the mistakes that people make is wetting the suction cups. I've done that too and it slides. The instructions say to use alcohol on the wall to make sure it is bone dry. It also says the suction cups need to be dry. When all surfaces are dry and flat it seems to work very well.
B0016NP0ZA I bought this at the same time as the lady bug toy holder because I knew I did not want to use adhesive.  The suction cups work great.  Follow the directions, clean them and the wall with alcohol, and make sure you get the cups fully on the tile not bridging any grout lines and you should be fine.  It would be nice if this were included in the main product, but at least it is offered as an option and I think worth the extra few bucks.
B0016NP0ZA We got the Boon Pod, Ladybug and wanted it above our tub, without having to use adhesive to hang it. This is perfect. Followed the instructions to clean and let dry the surface on which it will hang. Works great.
B0016NP0ZA I had the taped bracket and it fell so decided to give this one a try. It has fallen once but that may be my fault (too much weight). It is great because even if it does fall you can just put it back up without having to purchase replacement tabs like the other one. I also like because we plan to move soon and I don't have to worry about getting this out of the bathroom. Would definitely recommend.
B0016RSDYG Really beautiful, modern design. I was worried it did not work together with my mattress (nook pure) but it fits nicely. As other reviews pointed out, the paint chips easily. I attached a mobile to one side of the crib and it got damaged, but I would not complain about quality either. Happy with it. Would recommend.
B0016RSDYG We received this crib several days ago and it was a cinch to put together.  It looks great and half the price of the oeuf baby cribs.
B0016RSDYG I did extensive research into a modern-looking and sturdy crib that won't cost me an arm and a leg. This Babyletto Modo 3 in 1 crib fits the bill. Setup was easy and the whole thing definitely feels solid. Much better than some of those flimsy looking entry lines - including the $200 Ikea cribs.I did also consider the Babyletto Mercer 3 in 1, but ultimately went with the Modo because there is enough clearance under the Modo 3 in 1 for my Roomba to move in and out. With the Mercer, just be aware that the bottom of the drawer almost touches the ground, so you won't be able to either vacuum or sweep the area underneath the crib - and that area ends up becoming a dust landfill.
B0016RSDYG I have had my son sleeping in this crib for over 3 months and am very happy with it.  I put it together by myself in about an hour and a half.  I took my time and moved a little slower knowing it was made of soft wood.  There were a few steps that would have been easier to complete with two people.  The wood is a little soft and I did make one ding in the wood on the inside, but this would have been avoided had I waited for my husband to get home to help.  Very sturdy once assembled.
B0016RSDYG I don't think you can find better quality for the money if you're looking for a modern crib.  Love this crib.  Our daughter's nursery is mid-century modern-ish and this works perfectly in it.
B0016RSDYG My wife and I are having twins and we recently purchased two of these cribs.  We put both together last night and I have to say it was very easy to assemble and seems to be very sturdy.  Probably took us 45 minutes to put each one together at the most.  The materials seem to be very good quality and the crib actually looks better than cribs that are much more expensive.  One thing to note is that both cribs we received already meet the new CPSC standard for full size cribs even though that standard doesn't go into effect until June 28, 2011.  Babyletto (MDB \"Million Dollar Baby is the parent company) were great about responding to my email and confirming that the cribs we had conform to this new standard.  Overall we are extremely happy with this crib.Update:  We have now had our twins for just over two weeks and the cribs seem to be very comfortable for them.  They actually sleep better in the cribs than most other places, i.e. bouncy chairs, etc.  The cribs are solidly built and have worked great with no loose parts or creaks/rattles.  Overall still very satisfied.
B0016RSDYG This crib is beautiful, and I love it. It wasn't too difficult to put together and it looks great in our nursery. Amazon really does have it for the best price (I looked everywhere), plus free shipping on such a large item was wonderful. It came undamaged and well packed.
B0016RSDYG I've used this crib for my daughter who is now 7 months and we've had no issues with it what so ever. That being said she's not standing up in it yet so I'm yet to lower the mattress yet. I like the style of the crib and it fit our criteria cause we were looking for a crib that didn't convert into a twin bed cause we didn't care for the look of the head and foot board when used as a crib. Plus you can 'float' this crib in the center of the room which looks great.
B0016RSDYG We received this crib quickly and the packaging was intact.  No dents, bumps, scratches in the crib pieces when we opened the box and everything was packed neatly and efficiently.  I was 5 months pregnant when the box came and I assembled the crib mostly by myself in less than an hour.  Needed my husband to help me hold a few things in place, but only because I'm somewhat clumsy!  Assembly was very easy and I love that the fasteners are placed discreetly so you don't see a bunch of shinly metal screws all over.We love the simple, more modern design of the crib and the finish is beautiful.  Very pleased with the aesthetics.  I did bump into it with the vacuum (I said I was clumsy!) the other day and leave a little ding, but I figure it's furniture for a kids room and it's going to get a little beat up.  I had read reviews that the wood was a little soft and dings easily so I was not surprised to see that my vacuum bump left a mark, but I guess I just expect that any baby/kid furniture is going to get beat up over time so that was really not a huge issue to me.As I write this I am 6 months pregnant, so we have no little one using the crib yet and I cannot review based on usage.  But based on packaging, shipping, assembly, and appearance we are very pleased!
B0016RSDYG I bought this crib for my 2nd baby, who is on the way.  The first time around, I spent WAY too much money on my DS's nursery furniture, buying all the conversion rails (from crib to toddler bed to a full-sized bed), etc.  At the time, it seemed so wise, but honestly, I don't think I want to keep the crib until my son is fully grown and ready for a full-sized bed.  But since we spent so much $ on it, I feel like I have to keep it longer than I would otherwise have wanted.  With the Babyletto Modo, the price is great.  It is very en trend with the espresso and white combination, and I don't feel like I have to keep it for more than a few years.  It is just as sturdy as my son's pricey crib, and seems like it will be durable enough to handle our next child, at least through the toddler bed stage.  I also like that it is low enough for me to be able to put a sleeping child into it even when we eventually will have to lower the mattress.
B0016RSDYG I love this crib.  It's made with solid wood (no toxic particle board) and has a lower profile, which makes it a bit easier to put the baby in when its set to the lowest setting.  It's a no frills crib, which is what we wanted, so it takes up less real estate in my son's nursery.  The wood is quite soft, and we have accidentally dinged the edges with the vacuum, which I am really bummed about.  It set up very easily and is also pretty light, so you can move it around if necessary.  Fits standard crib mattresses.
B0016RSDYG I love this crib! When I was looking for a crib I wanted a white one and a more modern one. I looked at many many cribs and most of my ideal cribs were way out of my price range. I kept coming back to this one, so finally took the plunge and made the purchase and am not disappointed!It came from Amazon in perfect condition. The step up was super easy. The directions were easy to read and follow. My husband put it together in no time at all. It is a bit lightweight, but I didn't expect it to be heavy with the price we paid.This is our first baby so I don't have any experience with other cribs but I am 5'1&#34; and this crib is a great height. I don't imagine having any problems with putting baby in/ getting baby out.
B0016RSDYG Purchased a second one for my second child. Great modern look and doesn't take over the whole room. highly recommend
B0016RSDYG This is one sleek looking crib that has a decent price tag for it's design. It's well made and pretty easy to assemble. You will find that once you convert it to the toddler bed, it looks even more attractive! It fits a regular sized crib mattress and has no moving parts (which can be tough for short moms who have to lower sleeping babies.If you'd like a complete crib buying guide, visit the website, AllMomsArePerfect.com and look under 'baby gear essentials'. You'll find great tips on where you can save money, a stroller shopping guide, and how to prepare for the hospital delivery.Good luck!
B0016RSDYG This is a great crib -- streamline, compact, sturdy, strong, etc. We had it as a crib for almost two years and had no problems whatsoever with it.However, when we transferred it to a toddler bed, we found that the side rail doesn't fit in flush. See the pictures and you'll know what I'm talking about. There is a big gap and shows the mattress under the rail. Furthermore, it shows screw holes that are no longer in use. We were extremely disappointed because it looks like a piece of junk now.I would recommend this bed for anyone wanting just a crib. Skip it if your plan is to convert it to the toddler bed with rail. Or even without the rail as you'll still see all the screw holes on the bottom and the mattress will slide.
B0016RSDYG I ordered this through Amazon and it came within 2 days.  My husband and I spent about an hour putting it together.  The instructions were ok, could be better but we figured everything out.  We had enough hardware and there were no damaged pieces.  Whew!  Everything looks really good and sturdy but I haven't officially used it since the baby is not here.  However, the assembly was good and the wood wasn't as cheap as I read in other reviews. I'm happy with it so far and love the color, finish and look.  I ordered the Willow Natural Coconut Palm Crib Mattress to go with this crib and it fits perfectly!  One of the reasons i picked this crib was because it is geared towards shorter women like myself and the price point was good for me.  I'm still debating on the dresser as I heard really bad reviews.
B0016RSEG8 This is a great portacrib mattress. I bought it because there have been some studies which suggest that SIDS deaths may be related to fire retardant chemicals in infant bedding and the lack of some newborns to process it well. This pad is firesafe through the use of a different, not so chemically laden process. In terms of what buyers said about the pad's thinness, newborns do not need the kind of thick mattresses that adults think of as more comfortable. (In fact, I once heard it put very well: In terms of SIDS safety, \"If the mattress looks like it would be comfortable for you, no newborn should be going anywhere near it!\") The comfort comes in whatever soft, lovely, tight-fitting material you lay over it. I used the chenille sheets by American Baby Company - although for said reasons, I wished I could find something truly organic (not just an organic surface as I saw with some products). I was impressed with the pad - it looks and feels very well made, and I don't know how on earth they got an all-cotton surface to be waterproof, but it feels remarkably impermeable without sacrificing comfort. The pad is very firm, more so than many other baby matress thingies - the other reviewer should have nothing to fear. The only concern I think people should have with the thickness of the mattress is that you need to make sure your sheets - which may be designed with a thicker mattress in mind - don't bunch up and become a crumply surface the baby could slide around in too much. If you run into such a problem, safety pin the corners of the sheet's underside together to make it tighter on top.
B0016RSEG8 This mattress fit perfectly in ourDelta Children's Products Riley Mini Crib - Dark Cherry. If you are looking for sheets and waterproof pad, I highly recommend theNaturepedic Organic Cotton Portable Crib Fitted Sheet, Ivoryand theNaturepedic Waterproof Flat Portacrib Pad, 24x38. They all fit together. The mattress, waterproof pad, and fitted sheet are all that we use in the crib and it works nicely and comfortably for our little one. It was difficult at first to find a smaller crib and all the appropriately sized crib items while also meeting or exceeding all the safety recommendations, so to find this combo was a relief.
B0016RSEG8 I want everything to be healthy for the little one!  I bought for my grandson as a gift for his new mini crib.  He likes it and enjoys to stand on it inside his crib!
B0016RSEG8 It fits out portable crib very tightly and is of a high quality...I would recommend it again. Just as described.
B0016RSEG8 I got a replacement for my original one because I felt it was too soft and had too much &#34;give.&#34; My baby is a belly sleeper and she sinks into this to the point that her face looks like it's in the mattress.  The replacement had the same issue.  They indicated it's because I was using in a Graco and the support is not intended for this, but it has the same issue even on a hard floor.  I have their full-size mattress which I absolutely love.  I would only recommend this mattress for babies who are over 6 months of age and are NOT belly sleepers. Then I would think it would be fine. I wish there was a similar option in terms of organic but the only other option is not as natural as this one is.  I felt others should know about this possibility with this  mattress because I feel it is a safety issue.
B0016RSEG8 Spent a long time trying to find an organic mattress that I thought I would be happy with. This one fits our Alpha Mini Rocking Crib very well. Snug, but not hard to get the sheets on. Wipes down easily. Seems very firm enough. Very very light so it's easy to pull out and put a new sheet on. Went with American Baby Company SheetsAmerican Baby Company Organic Cotton Interlock Portable Fitted Crib Sheet, NaturalandAmerican Baby Company Organic Fitted Cotton Velour Porta-Crib Sheet, Natural. Not please with the Naturepedic waterproof pad. Too hard to get it to sit flat under the sheet while putting the sheet on. Also skipped the padded quilted organic waterproof mattress pad since I thought it made the bedding too soft. Am just going to use sheets and maybe flannel waterproof protectors over them if the kids end up needing them.
B0016RSEG8 I own a full-size Naturpedic crib mattress and love it.  It fits tightly in the crib, isn't toxic so there's no issue with off-gassing as with traditional mattresses, is lightweight enough for me to handle it easily, and is rock hard so there is absolutely no question about its safety.  When I needed a portable crib mattress I decided to try Naturpedic, despite the steep price, because I expected the same.  I was somewhat disappointed when the product arrived.  On the positive side, it fits snugly around the edges, leaving no gaps in the portable crib.  Also, it is the firmest portable crib mattress that I could find, and I tried several from Dream on Me, LA Baby, Colgate, and even Mamadoo.  Naturpedic uses the same Air-Core technology as it does in the full-sized crib mattress.  However, the problem lies in the waterproof organic cotton cover which does not fit tightly to the core of the mattress as it does with the full-size mattress.  The cover has a rippling effect and tends to bubble when the baby is placed on it.  I use it with the Grayson portable crib made by Babyletto.  The mattress dimensions match the portable crib dimensions perfectly, so that's not the issue.  The rippling issue caused me a great deal of stress when I received the product because my baby has just started rolling over onto his belly at night and I was concerned that this would create a suffocation hazard.  Because we've been staying in a hotel for a month (our home was majorly damaged and had to be repaired), I was forced to use this mattress as it was the best one that I could find, despite its flaws.  It has caused me many sleepless nights (but no scares).  There isn't a portable crib mattress that I have found that I could wholeheartedly recommend.  I still believe this is the best portable crib mattress out there.  Use this if you absolutely must use a portable crib.  Another tip, only use a tight fitting fitted sheet, preferably NOT one made of jersey, as the jersey sheets tend to stretch and, in my opinion, become a loose bedding suffocation hazard.  Instead, use the Naturpedic organic portable crib sheet or any traditional cotton sheet that matches the dimensions of the mattress, fits tightly, and has all around elastic.  And DON\"T use a mattress pad cover with it as it makes the mattress softer.  If you have the choice, stick with a traditional, full-size mattress in a full-size crib once your baby is rolling over.
B0016RSEG8 I have this mattress for the crib and bought the same one for our porta crib/pack and play.  I love the Naturpedic line and the product they sell.  I was so happy to find a mattress to fit the pack and play from them too.  It's nice and thick, super comfy for my twin boys.  They have slept in this from the time I brought them home until they stopped late day naps at 7 months old.  Now at 10 months the mattress is the bottom of the pack and play and as they are pulling up and standing and then dropping back down to sitting, they land on something soft and comfy instead of hard.  They get in and play and are able to stand up on the mattress since it's nice and firm.  Would recommend this for anywhere between newborn age to any age still using a porta crib for sleep or playtime.
B0016RSEG8 After searching for a natural organic bed for our expecting baby, I decided to take a chance on this one after purchasing the Da Vinci Crest 50 Coil mattress which was made with PVC toxic material. Even though the previous mattress fits perfectly with our Da Vinci Mini crib, when it was a sunny day and the nursery got a bit warm, there were obvious fumes coming from the mattress since it's had PVC. I didn't want to chance it so we decided to buy this one. This pad was extremely firm and doesn't have a smell. After placing the same brand mattress pad and sheets on, it was slightly snug for the crib but still works.
B0016RSEG8 This mattress seems comfortable and it wipes cleans well. It fit nicely in our portable crib.  Happy with this purchase.
B0016RSEG8 We bought a full size Naturepedic organic mattress for our toddler's crib when he was born almost 2 years ago, and it's been the best purchase.  So when shopping for a mattress for the mini-crib his sister will be sleeping in, I knew I wanted another Naturepedic.  So many other organic mattresses are more expensive because they are made with wool and latex - 2 things I happen to be allergic to.  I liked that this one is made from something I feel is safe for my baby to sleep on, and I feel the price is fair after actually seeing how well it works in our crib.This portacrib pad/mattress fits the DaVinci/Baby Mod mini cribs perfectly.  Our  mini crib came with a mattress that was horrible (although the cribs are great), it had gaps between the side and the mattress, and the mattress itself was flimsy and covered in vinyl.  This Naturepedic mattress fits great, with a nice tight fit, and it's firm enough for a newborn.  It's much sturdier and even half an inch thicker than the mattress provided by our crib manufacturer.  I know some reviewers were worried that it's only 2 inches thick, and it's labeled as a \"pad\", but it is a mattress, and very high quality.I highly recommend this mattress, and in case you're wondering, we've found that the Carter's Portacrib Sheets fit it perfectly.
B0016RSEG8 This mattress is thin and is firm and I wouldn't want to sleep on it but my baby loves it. It is made of cotton so I can see that some of them may have bunches because sometimes that happens with these organic products. If you were to get one of those, I would exchange it because ours was even throughout the mattress.-Firm and safe, fits in my davinci mini crib tight and perfect-Water proof and easy to wipe off-It is just about all my 2 month old will sleep on (now 13.5 lbs and 24 in long)-Yes it works as a mattress alone, it may seem thin but it may be because we as adults would see it as very uncomfortable
B0016RVLZY I loved this product when I first opened it... no foul odor and it was much more substantial than the mattress that came with my bassinet. After a single usages by my 8lb baby, there was a huge indent which was dissapointing. I've continued to use the mattress, I just rotate it and try to fix the indentations every night!
B0016RVLZY I was disappointed to learn that the core of Naturepedic bassinet pads are made of \"30% polyethylene foam.\" I thought they were only coated with polyethylene. I would much prefer a mattress or pad with a natural rubber core. The Naturepedic representative said the Naturepedic crib mattresses also contain this same polyethylene foam, although I'm not sure how much. I just do not feel comfortable putting my baby on their mattresses.
B0016RVLZY When I purchased a bassinet for my daughter, I did not like the flimsy mattress that came with the bassinet. I began to look for a new mattress for the bassinet and found this. Make sure you measure the bassinet before ordering this item. I did and it fits well. A friend of mine didn't and it doesn't fit her bassinet.After 2 1/2 months of continuous use, the mattress is still holding up well. It is starting to take on my daughter's impression. It would be nice to \"flip it\" to even out the wear and tear on it but it does not appear that that will work. Hence the four stars.The price has gone down since I purchased my bassinet too.All in all this is a good mattress for the price and is a much better option than the standard flimsy mattress that usually comes with a bassinet.
B0016RVLZY Thick, firm and organic - love it. I purchased this to replace the mattress in the Summer Infant By Your Side Sleeper. It fits but could be about 1 inch longer. However, the mattress that the Sleeper comes with actually does not fit in tight to the ends, so I don't think that there is much difference. However, rolling up a prefold diaper and wedging it in to cover the 1-2 inch space (at baby's feet) actually makes it a really tight fit at the top and sides - tighter than the mattress it came with. I think it will be great for every night and during the day use. It's not ideal for traveling, as the sleeper won't close up as well so in those cases I will use the mattress it came with. I purchased Kushies organic bassinet sheet and it fits great after washing!
B0016RVLZY We bought the oval bassinet mattress to replace the plastic mattress that came with a cosleeper nest. It's fine, but there's not anything to it and the price is just ridiculous. We have the reversible crib/toddler mattress from the same company and that was something like $250. It's fantastic quality, so it seems ridiculous that this flimsy little mattress that is less than 1/20 the size of the crib mattress is almost $70.She didn't use this much because she wouldn't sleep apart from me very well, but we still had issues with the mattress dipping where she lay on it, even though she was teeny tiny (less than 6 pounds) when she used it.There aren't many options for organic bassinet mattresses, so for that reason alone (if you are like us and insist on organic bedding) it may be worth getting, but the price is still ridiculous.
B0016RVM4O Yes, it seems to be comfy, and I feel better about using this than a plastic/vinyl sheet for all of the obvious reasons. But I don't really consider it waterproof. Fortunately in my daughter's first year we've had very few leakage problems at night, but the first time her diaper did fail her, I removed her sheet only to discover this \"waterproof\" pad was wet through. There wasn't a huge leak, either, my daughter's cloth diaper had just slipped out above its cover and wicked moisture up, through her jammies, and onto the sheet. But the pad still did not prevent the mattress from getting wet. Maybe it helps for minor things, drool and whatnot simply by providing bulk between sheet and mattress, but I wouldn't count on it for anything major. Really wish I had better things to say about it.
B0016RVM4O This is a great crib protector pad. (Pee pad)  It is flat which makes it easier to change.  The materials are also healthier than any other waterproof crib pad I have found.  I have a non-waterproof crib mattress so just in case, I have the fitted one and then this flat one on top of that.  I keep the fitted one on at all times and I only change the flat one.  I have 2 flat ones, one to use and one to wash.  We haven't had any leaks so the fitted one is still clean.  It does take a while to dry but that doesn't bother me.  I just put it on low heat and set my dryer for 50 minutes.  A longer drying time is well worth the benefits of having healthier bedding materials. Use low heat to make sure you don't damage the waterproof membrane.
B0016RVM4O We received the item, but the item itself does not seem waterproof. The underside does not seem to have any type of sealed backing and it looks that any type of liquid would nonetheless seep through the pad.I wouldn't recommend it.
B0016RVM4O I bought this to put over our Naturepedic Lightweight Classic 2 Stage mattress for extra protection. It seems like it's made of heavy duty canvas so am sure it will hold up to any messes. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars (vs. 5 for all our other Naturepedic items - crib mattress, changing pad, cradle mattress) is because this is probably overkill if you have a naturepedic mattress already.  It's very thick and I got this instead of the FITTED crib pad because those reviews made it seem like the fitted pad took a long time to dry.  Either way, it's still great quality and would be great if you don't have a waterproof mattress to begin with.
B0016RVM4O Need to return it as it is -way- bigger than its size and we cant fit it on the crib without it bunching and causing a hazard. Just measured it - it is 31x54.
B0016RVM4O We have not had a severe leak yet so i can't speak to that yet.  but minor leaks and spit up it does great.  the fit is a bit big but when we put the fitted sheet on top we dont have any issues.  would definitely recommend this one!
B0016RVM4O I am so glad I purchased two of these crib pads.  I love that they are not fitted and it makes the crib easier to make.  I took another reviewers suggestion and  make the crib with a crib pad, sheet, crib pad and sheet.  This way if an accident occurs in the night, I can just pull off the top set.  It is also good to know that they are breathable and not vinyl.  They wash and dry well too.  I can see these passed along through a lot of babies when I am done with them.
B001708AS6 I bought these for my daughters nursery and they look great. They are a perfect pink! Buy at least two of them (depending on window size maybe more) to get the bunched look.
B001708AS6 I purchased this valance for our nursery and they look perfect!  I didn't want anything that was too pink.  This valance is light and airy .
B001708AS6 I was so looking forward to putting this window valance in the nursery but was disappointed when it arrived. The color was not that really pretty pink that was pictured but rather more of a pink-purple. Also the tulle looked very cheap and nothing like the picture.
B001708AS6 I ordered two valances and a matching tadpoles crib skirt... all three items were a different shade of pink. It would look terrible near each other so I had to return them. What a shame!
B001708AS6 I wouldn't be surprised if every baby girl room has this! It is the cutest thing in existence. Just barely pink, it looks great with any style...sleek and modern, or antique/vintage. I'm not a fan of pastel, but on this i was sold. it's whimsical, inexpensive and well-made.
B00173DN6M perfectly fit to mini crib DaVinci. neutral color and very fun to have. good quality ))) I love it and hope to my baby will love it too
B00173DN6M This is very cute and very good quality!!  It fits our Port-a-crib perfectly!!  I bought a nice crib at a resale shop and ordered a new mattress, mattress cover and this set.  I wanted gender neutral so we can use if for years to come.  Very pleased with the product.
B00173DN6M Very Gender neutral great size for the mini crib and adorable on the mini crib I love it. Highly Recommend.
B00173DN6M It is a really cute set, nice design and neutral colors but unfortunately the sheet does not fit out mini crib mattress, it is too small. I can use it for pack and play but not regular crib. Wish I could use the whole set together.
B00173DN6M We got this for our son, and it's really adorable! We use it in our mini crib, and it's a perfect fit! The bumper doesn't stick-up a ton, so it's not as dangerous as some bumpers can be.
B00175ROGU KNOBBY TEXTURE CHEWY TUBE GREEN  very small, but baby likes to hold it, I usually give it while feed her
B00175ROGU She doesn't pay too much attention to it, but every kid is different I guess.  The product is fine, she just isn't into it.  Which is weird, because they had one at daycare she was totally into which is why I purchased the exact same thing!  But now she's not.  Go figure.
B00175ROGU I give this to my four year old in stressful moments. He doesn't look for it - so no &#34;binky&#34; issues - but I like to have it on hand. This was Christmas vacation so I used it a LOT because he was off-schedule and had a hard time going to sleep. This really helped a lot.
B00175ROGU Durable and fun for my 23m son. He has oral motor issues and suspected SPD and this has been great. We trace the outline of his mouth around his lips which reflexively works his facial muscles, and he loves the nubby texture on his tongue. The only improvements I'd make:*Something to attach it to his shirt safely (he likes to chew shirt buttons and sleeves)*I wish it weren't hollow. This is often used as a whistle, and his drool comes shooting out the hollow end, which is pretty gross.
B00175ROGU My son has some chewing issues and this product helps him a lot. Instead of chewing on clothes and other items he grabs this. The size is great and he likes the color and texture.
B00175ROGU Always great to add to our chewy tube collection.  My daughter uses these a lot at therapy and sometimes I put her baby food on this to try to get her to eat.
B00175YU7G This has been my baby's very favorite teether. She absolutely loves it! We started using at about 2 1/2-3 months. It's soft and easy for her to hold. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the ears are a bit long for a teether. My baby has gagged on them numerous times.
B00175YU7G I thought this would be a nice, soft rattle for our baby... but it's the only one we have that she couldn't care less about.  Maybe it's too \"boring\" looking for her?  She'll reach for it when handed to her, but she quickly drops it in search of something else.  Also, I personally wish I had noted it was made in China before purchasing.
B00175YU7G I got this for some friends who are trying to be eco-friendly parents.  They were thrilled with this rattle/teether.  Their little one has really taken to it.  He got it at about 1 1/2 mo and loves chewing on it.  It's easy to wash and is shaped well for tiny hands.  They always bring it whenever they take the baby out somewhere.
B00175YU7G My son liked this teether a lot, especially as an older baby.  I like the soft knit over the firm body which gives more resistance when gnawing on it.  I wouldn't change a thing about it!
B00175YU7G We received one as a gift and tje little one played with it since newborn. Not sure how to wash it as it was heavily chewed on during teething episodes so we tossed it into the washer and dryer one day and had no problem. Since then, we had washed it monthly for a uear now and it retains its shape and color.Every time I go to a baby shower, I always include one as part of the gift!
B00175YU7G Cute natural toy.  I love that it is washable and made of natural materials.  It has a nice little rattle to it.
B00175YU7G This rattle is so cute. It took awhile for my child to get excited about it (9 months) but now it soothes her. I wash it in my washing machine without any problems.
B00175YU7G I thought this would be a fun toy for my 6 month old, but he is not interested in it. It's durable and cute, but the rattle noise is extremely soft... not enough to hold my son's attention. And it is not something he is interested in teething on; although he's interested in teething on most everything else he can get his hands on. It's a nice toy, just not for us.
B00175YU7G I loved the idea of an organic teether for my son, so I purchased this bear. However, since day one of introducing it to him, he has showed little to no interest in it at all. It is rather stiff and doesn't have the best rattle. He used to suck on the hands occasionally, but now has completely lost interest in this toy altogether. For the price, I would not purchase this again.
B00175YU7G Our baby irl has been teething since she was only 2 months old. She did not like the cold teethers but the hard ones she would bonk her head with so... we tried this one and she loves it! She is now 6 months old and we have to take the bear with us wherever we go!
B00175YU7G At first my son wasn't fond of this teether... he just never liked it. He puts EVERYTHING in his mouth but I give him the one thing I want him to put in his mouth and he refuses it! BUT, after a few months I tried it again and now it seems to work quite well. With teething it's important to have more than one type because baby gets bored with each relatively quickly.
B00175YU7G This company used to be great and then it was bought by a larger company. Says organic but it is made in China and stuffed with polyester. Not too organic if you ask me.
B0017AE3BO The handle is nice to have and makes it easier to use. The bristles are just like any other standrd shampoo brush. Have never used the soap dispensing function, but I am sure it works fine.
B0017AE3BO What a waste of money. I am so bummed that I threw away the box & can no longer return it even though I only used it once. Seems great in theory but does not work at all! Soap did not dispense and I swear after using the brush it actually GAVE my baby flakes on her scalp! This is totally going in the trash
B0017AE3BO The brush does a good job and serves it purpose.  It's nice that it can pump out a little bit of baby shampoo/wash (whatever you put in it) but it requires a lot of pumps and doesn't really lather or anything like that.  It's really more useful to wash a baby's scalp because of the bristles and not really a necessity for infants but nice to h
B0017AE3BO We purchased this for our newborn and have used it for almost two years now. The dispenser is easy to access for an adult and holds a lot of soap, which means no frequent refills. The brush side was nice to use in her hair when she was little, though her hair is much too thick for it now. The sponge side works okay, but seemed as though it didn't dispense enough soap. You need to be careful how you store it when it is full or the soap will leak out-- there is a printed reminder on the brush that tells you what end is up. It was good for what we needed, but not really necessary.
B0017AE3BO Worked awesome with the Winnie the pooh cradle cap soap! Just 3 days and my 4 mo old cradle cap is 100 gone!
B0017AE3BO Hands down, the gentlest but strongest brush around to prevent cradle cap.The bristles are thick but soft. The sponge part stinks though. You are better off just lathering the baby's head and then just using the bristle part. Sponge is too messy because you have to fill the body of the brush with shampoo to get it to work and it leaks everywhere if you do.
B0017AE3BO I love using this brush/sponge to shampoo my daughter's hair and her little hands and feet. If you rub the sponge too much it starts to peel off--we've already replaced ours once and my baby is only 6 months old. But, we bought it again because I couldn't find anything better, and now I know to be more gentle with it. Good, cheap buy!
B0017AE3BO It is very convenient.  The shampoo dispenser is awesome.  You fon't use a lot of shampoo, and the brush at the end is soft to wash my infant's hair.  The only inconvenience was the dispenser button.  It does not tell the amount of shampoo dispensed;  however, once you start using it, you will know.
B0017AE3BO I got this cause my baby has cradle cap, it really works the brush is just the perfect size and strenght for a baby I was able to used it on the dry hair to loose the flakes first, worked great. I was not worry too much about the dispenser wich it did not work very well with me, but I think is because of the consistency of the special shampoo I used for craddle cap wich is kind of heavy liquid, so it was taking too long for the dispenser to work and with a wet baby in the tub that moves a LOT you want to be quick I just used the shampoo as it is and the brush and I really liked it, I honestly recomend this one cause I also used the little sponge to bath my baby : )
B0017AE3BO I love this brush.  I love that it dispenses shampoo/body wash, I love the shape, I love that it is a sponge and a scrubber all in one.  However, they are not durable at all.  I've gone through 2 in 3 months (I bathe my son every 2 days).  I first thought that maybe I got a lemon, but the same thing happened to the second brush I ordered. The sponge is glued on and starts to slowly detach until the product becomes unusable.  I really wish they would figure out how to make it more durable because having it fall apart after 15-20 uses is unacceptable.
B0017AE3BO The brush I use in the bath, really just because I like to see her hair all brushed and her scalp stimulated, but it is useless otherwise. It is not good for skin, and the sponge side is not maneuverable enough to use in her crevases. I use a washcloth or my hands for most of her bathing. It would probably be more interesting if a baby has a lot of hair.
B0017JB6HY I ended up going to buy one of these after my baby was born. My newborn needed to be swaddled to stay asleep for any length of time. Trying to swaddle with a blanket was too hard. This product has velcro to help keep it snug. I like that the bottom pouch can be undone for diaper changes. I don't think that the Sleep Sack brand swaddlers work any better, so the price difference is a huge factor in my recommending this product. I recently bought the larger size for my daughter now that she's grown out of the small.
B0017JB6HY My daughter was less than 5 pounds when she came home from the hospital and this swaddle wrap was the one that fit her best.  It is very easy to get baby in and out of this wrap and it was much more difficult for her to free her arm from this wrap versus the Halo Sleepsack.  She is now 8 lbs and the wrap is a little tight on her already.  There is no way this swaddle would fit a bigger infant - I would recommend getting a bigger size if your baby is 7.5-8 lbs or more.
B0017JB6HY These swaddles are great because they keep the child secure.  When my child got old enough to start rolling over, we stop swaddling the arms and just swaddle around the chest.  It becomes a routine to wrap them up and put them to bed.  My daughter actually smiles when I get the swaddle out, because she knows when it is time to go to sleep.
B0017JB6HY So many cute prints!  This is much easier to use than to try to swaddle with a regular receiving blanket.  Also can keep baby swaddled without undoing the entire thing.
B0017JB6HY We have 4 of these and they are wonderful!  We swaddle under his arms because I don't like things too close to his head and he pulls his arms out anyway, but these keep him warm and happy!
B0017JB6HY not worth the money for me. I'd rather just wrap my baby in a blanket, like a burrito..she'd get more use out of that anyway. She only used this product about 4x. by the time she was around 2 months old, she was too big for it.
B0017JB6HY it was just ok - either my baby was super strength baby or I just wasn't wrapping her correctly, but she would bust out of it every single time. I did much better with a big swaddling blanket and swaddling her the old school way - i probably only tried to use this a few times and gave up.
B0017JB6HY I absolutely love this product! It's very soft and comfy and it keeps my baby nice and cozy.I love the fact that I do not have to un-swaddle her completely for the diaper change. Also it's very easy to use, even my husband can do it :-)))
B0017LCZEU These are great for creating memories in your home.My wife and I struggled with trying to get our child to put his hand into the print without bending his fingers (trying to grab the clay) but ultimately after trying a few times (rerolling the clay) succeeded. We bought an extra set to produce more so that instead of giving each of them (our set produced 2) to our parents and leaving her with none&#8230; she will now have this precious keepsake as well.Things to keep in mind here&#8230;-clay doesn't dry in 1 o 2 days; ours took probably 5  days and had to be flipped over so that bottom could dry-product cracks slightly depending on how it dries (read instructions carefully)-Ribbon provided is green, yellow and pink so if you have a boy and produce two of these you'll have to use the neutral color as wellGood product.. cost effective for 'imprinting' a moment in the life of your child and yours.
B0017LCZEU So the kit has the ability to make two keepsakes, which is great as it will make Christmas presents for both set of grandparents. Really easy to use. Just have to make sure the clay is soft. Made impressions of my lo's hands then left them out to dry. Once dry, I'll attach the ribbons and wrap for presents. Wonderful idea.Update: they dried really well and truly hard. Both sets of grandparents absolutely loved it and can't wait to display it. So good that I'm buying another set to keep for myself.
B0017LCZEU These were great and just what I had been looking for.  I've seen it since in stores for similar price but I was many, many months pregnant at the time I bought.  Much more convenient to order from Amazon. I was able to get 2 molds from it. Highly recommend.
B0017LCZEU I made two hand print ornaments from this kit.  The dough was easy to roll, and I really liked the final product.  The ornament was a bit boring, so I painted it with glitter and glazed it for shine.
B0017LCZEU These did not turn out good at all even after following all the directions. They dried very cracked as opposed to a smooth surface as pictured. I do not recommend.
B0017LCZEU follow the directions closely and you  shouldn't have any issues.Mine turned out very lovely and i couldn't be happier. i did a bunch of them for christmas gifts too ( you can only make 2 from each box tho, i'm saying i bought more to use as christmas gifts)don't put them near direct heat or direct cold and they will last in better condition.
B0017LCZEU We haven't made these yet... they are going to be Christmas presents for the grandparents. Can't wait to make them with my son! :) (He's 8 weeks)
B0017LCZEU This is another must have, we put her little foot prints up every Christmas, I'm so glad I got this!
B0017LCZEU Skip the round mold and the straw that are included with this kit as they leave rough edges. Best to roll 1/3 - 1/2 of the clay into a ball in your hands with a sprinkle of water then flatten it out, ideally onto something non-stick, by hand or with a smooth bottomed plate that's also been spritzed with water. Immediately press baby's hand or foot into the clay in a gentle but firm rolling motion from heel to toe or palm to fingertips then quickly touch up any edge cracking with moistened finger tips.My disks took about a week to fully cure during dry mid-Winter. Even then they should be very carefully removed from whatever surface they're drying on and the back may still not be entirely smooth. The included ribbon is &#34;meh&#34; in quality and color and you'll need a thin acrylic paint from a craft or art store anyway if you don't want to keep the matte white clay finish. To add ribbon holes I used a low volt power drill with progressively larger drill bits until I got the diameter I wanted.
B0017LCZEU Used these when my baby was 2 weeks old. Very easy to work with, and they turned out great. Definitely recommend!
B0017LCZEU Finally I found one that worked! It was great. There wasn't a strict time limit so if I wasn't able to get a good print, I just started over again until it was right. It dried in a few days and stayed hard. I would do it again.
B0017LCZEU Since I was having my first child, I wanted to do everything. I got these around Christmas and tried them. the first time was a disaster. I followed the directions but the clay kept getting stuck to the cutter. finally I used my head and sprayed pam on the round cutter before cutting into the clay. best idea ever! if you get this, remember what I said. itll come in handy.
B0017LCZEU I loved making keepsakes of my baby's hand and foot. The instructions were clear, and easy to do. There were 3 ribbons to choose from. Pink, blue, and yellow.
B0017LCZEU The clay is easy to use and roll out, but I did not think that they impressions came out too clearly. Overall a good bet due to the fact that they are easy to use and inexpensive, but you sacrifice detail due to the nature of the clay, which almost has a spongy quality to it.
B0017LCZEU This is one of the best ways to preserve your child's hand or footprint.  Easy to mold and shape, dries nicely.  SOOOOOO much better than dealing with plaster!!!!  This material is awesome!
B0017LCZEU This kit makes a great Christmas gift or a way to commemorate baby's itsy-bitsy feet and hands for yourself and loved ones. I purchased the keepsake kit for a memento of my son's hands and feet. It contains a sealed package of the molding clay, three ribbons (pink, yellow, and blue), a pointy straw for making a hole, a dinky little roller that's not up to the task of rolling out the clay efficiently, a large round cardboard cutter, and basic instructions on how to create the ornaments.I strongly advise adding parchment paper to the list, not just to protect your countertops or table, but also for allowing the ornaments to dry. The hardening period takes anywhere from 4 to 7 days, and the parchment paper ensured the back of the clay was not exposed, disturbed, or crumbly. Parchment paper also makes for easy transfer.Making an ornament is straightforward. Roll out the clay to desired thickness, fight with your squirmy baby's reflexes to spontaneously curl his toes or contract her precious little hand into a fist, press down gently for an impression while your newborn honks blue murder, and then examine the results. With some luck, you may have a reasonable impression and an infuriated spouse co-opted into this special form of infantile torment. Didn't know that babies generally refuse to spread their fingers and adorable little toes when asked? Well, now you do. My husband decided to roll out the clay again for a second impression, and a third, at my insistence because the ravenous claw marks scratched over the white surface rather resembled an attack by a very tiny, very persistent velociraptor. Not exactly what I had in mind for enshrining my 8-week-old's most precious extremities.Once you do manage to gain an impression - preferably after a bottle of wine, I'll note, but not if you're the nursing mother - then keep it inside the wooden frame for best results. Drying may be a smidge slower, but without risk of cracking or falling apart by some act of circumstance. We used a large round cookie cutter in addition to the cardboard ornament cutter provided; between the two, the metal cookie cutter worked far better for clean edges and punching through the clay. The cardboard was shorter and flimsier.The results are very attractive though. Note for an average sized 2 month old baby, two plaques is all we managed to eke out without some creative positioning.
B0017LCZEU Product worked exactly as the package stated.  I had plenty of clay to make 2 keepsakes and had a little clay left over.  You do have to press firmly on your child's hand to get the imprint but the clay was moist enough that I could try again if I didn't like results the first time.  Since my daughter is only 6 months old, I had enough room on the edges of my keepsakes to add little christmas buttons for some color.  Fun project.
B0017LCZEU Pros:- Enough clay to do the job- Good parts and instructions- Easy to use- Dries fairly quickly i guess (2 days)Cons:- As it dried it got small visible cracks, nothing chipped off nor did it break, just visible cracks- It's HEAVY.  May have to screw the tree to the ground so it doesn't tip over (haha)We've since bought a \"bake it\" kit and we like the results much better.  It's much lighter, no cracks and seems more sturdy.
B0017LCZEU I bought this and it was so easy to use!  The only hard part was getting my 7 month old to not move her hand when I was trying to make the imprint, though the foot was no problem. I think it would be smarter if next time I did it with a with a sleeping baby!  I was actually able to get four great ornaments out of this set, though I did not make extremely thick ornaments. I made 4, 1/8 inch thick ornaments,  The clay was very easy to use.  I used a bigger straw than the one given as it was much easier to thread the ribbon through.
B0017LCZEU I really enjoyed making my son's handprint and footprint from this kit. I'm glad it is something I can look at every Christmas.
B0017LCZEU It went together easy and even held up to multiple kneading.  My son tended to grab it once we made the impression and so we had to redo it multiple times.  Eventually had to hold him upside down so the his catch reflex triggered and he held his hands out. LOL. But we got it and then it was easy to use the tools to cut it and the hole for the ribbon out and the ribbons were great. We were actually able to make two with one kit.
B0017LCZEU I actually spread the clay out to make 3 ornaments for Christmas. It was easy. It took about 3 days for the clay to dry in a moist climate.
B0017LCZEU This \"kit\" consists of:-A sealed package of molding material-A \"hole punch.\"  It is actually part of a drinking straw.  Literally.  It is the bottom few inches of a flimsy, striped plastic drinking straw.-A \"rolling pin.\"  This is a piece of dowel, about 1/2\" in diameter.-A wooden cookie-cutter.  Adequate for the job but leave sloppy edges.-Three lengths of ribbon: 1 blue, 1 pink, and 1 cream/yellowish in colorThe material is easy to work with and is a good consistency.  I was able to make 2 ornaments with a bit left over.  (I would not have had enough material to make 3.)  So, this kit will definitely provide what you need to make 2 plaques as advertised.  But given what it includes, it's difficult to see what justifies the price.  It's a chunk of synthetic clay plus a few pennies' worth of add-ons.Okay, a couple of tips for use of this product:1.  If you have a round biscuit cutter or cookie-cutter of an appropriate size, definitely use that instead of the cutter they provide - you'll get much cleaner edges!2.  The packaging said that the ornaments would dry in 1-2 days.  I did not find this to be true.  It took nearly a week before mine were fully hardened and dry.  I live in a desert climate, so I do not think humidity was the issue.  So, if you are planning to make these as a gift, DO NOT wait until the last minute -- give yourself plenty of lead time for them to dry!!
B0017LCZEU very cute project. We did this with our one month old. It was very hard to do it with a one month old. came out okay. Had to give it a couple of tries. Dried well. Love the ribbons.
B0017LCZEU Our family loved getting these for Christmas!  They were pretty easy to make, although we didn't like the cutters that they provided because they left the edges really ragged.  We just formed our own little circles.  I would use them early on though because our 4-mo-old's feet were nearly too big for the ornament!
B0017LCZEU I though this clay came with the stand; the picture is misleading. It takes a few tries before you get it right, but works well!
B0017LCZEU the clay molds very well, and the circle cutter and straw work great to create a classy-looking ornament. 4 stars because the circle was too small for my (large) 4.5 month-old's foot! (says it's good for up to two years old) so now I have one really nice hand ornament and one messy looking foot ornament. Overall would buy again though.
B0017LCZEU This kit is very user friendly.  Easy to use.  However, the clay is too hard.  I'm debating whether to purchase another one because I think I need to apply more pressure when doing the hand prints to get deeper better prints.  However, I pushed down on the sleeping baby's hand pretty hard.  The cutter was bad as all the other reviews say, I used a box cutter to cut away the excess left from the circular cutter provided in the kit.  Forget about using the &#34;rolling pin&#34; they provide unless you want weird dents in your clay and uneven clay..I used my own rolling pin.  Given the price and the fact that 2 of the items included in the kit I had to use my own household item or improvise I give it 3 stars majority going towards ease of use.  Note: apply pressure when doing hand prints! Don't hurt your little one though!!
B0017LCZEU The kit itself was easy, getting my newborn to unclinch her fist to make the hand print not so much. The kit had everything I needed and I was actually able to make 4 placques!  My only reserve, was it seemed to crack a little bit when it dried.  It's not extremely noticeable, so I only took off one star.  It could have also been user error.  However, right after I bought and made this I saw a recipe for a handprint mold on pinterest with flour and water.  Might try that next time before I buy another kit.
B0017LCZEU I ordered this kit to make tree ornaments of my baby's hand and foot prints for her first Christmas.  They turned out so well!  I'm not sure why the instructions say to roll it out 3/4 inch thick though.  A half inch would be plenty to leave a print and would be less heavy.  My baby was about 10 months when we did these and was able to fit her hand in the circle provided.  I just rolled out the remaining piece free form for her foot.  There was no mess for the baby and they dried in a few days.
B0017LCZEU You could probably make your own salt dough and save some money instead of buying this product. I was not impressed.
B0017LCZEU I don't recommend making 3 keepsakes out of one package but you can split in half and soften half at a time and it's a perfect amount.  I used everything provided in the package and they turned out great.  I made one of baby's hand and one of his foot.  Some of the reviewers were talking about putting a lot of pressure on baby's hand to make a good imprint but I found that to be untrue, i did not have to hurt a baby to make an imprint LOL.  Just make sure you soften it better and it's very soft.
B0017LCZEU We used this to make ornaments for our family members and it worked out great. If you roll the clay flat enough, you can actually get 3 hand prints. I used a glitter paint and added a touch of shine to it. Looks beautiful on our tree and we'll have it as a keepsake for years to come.
B0017LCZEU This clay works really well and is the old school type clay that captures every groove and fingerprint. I also used the pearhead kit but liked this one way better. Faster drying time and better imprints. I was also able to make 5 ornaments out of one kit!
B0017LCZEU Amazing ornaments.. Took about a week to complete.. But if you take the time to dry, sand edges, spray paint,then decorate, you will have amazing results! I glues a picture to the back of mine and decorated. Best time investment! They're only little once. I bought two sets and made 6 ornaments.
B0017LCZEU Cane out perfect could have probably made 3 plaques...very easy to do... Plan to do it again once he's older like school age
B0017LCZEU Very easy to use and you don't have to bake them!  Very please with this purchase.  I gave them out as gifts
B0017LCZEU It did the job, the only con is it's a bit heavy when dry which only concerns me because I'm using it as Christmas ornament.  I was able to imprint both the hand and foot of my 4 month old baby.
B0017LCZEU Easy to use and enough to do the twins hands as well as leftover for a dog paw! It came with three ribbons so it worked out perfect! Takes awhile to dry but no biggie.
B0017LCZEU These were a pain to make and did not turn out well at all.  I didn't realize how awful the material was until I had opened the container, so it was too late to return.  I found this to be a total waste of money.
B0017LCZEU Was able to make three keepsakes out of this and it was pretty easy to do!  The hard part was figuring out when to do it since mine are 9 months old and it's hard keeping them still.  I tried to do their feet, but they were far too big now for that, I'd recommend that for a newborn if you're going to do it.  The issue is, they tend to move their hands a lot.  So mine weren't perfect, but really, that in itself was nice to have captured.
B0017LCZEU Clear instructions, extra clay, added ribbons. Everything makes the kit complete. Not too pricey compared to some other similar products.
B0017NC77I This is very handy and I would not buy a big stroller again.  We went to the Rec center and the elevator was broken so I shrugged my shoulders and pulled my kid out, folded it down, and swung it over my shoulder.  This is definitively a great little stroller and very light.  The only thing I miss is being able to have a small diaper bag hanging on the bar while I pill my kid out.  I know you are not supposed to do that!  This will fall over because the stroller is so light.
B0017NC77I This is a fantastic umbrella stroller.  I picked this over the Maclaren Vollo and am extremely pleased.  A few things I love about it:--The sunshade is huge and can extend almost all the way down over the baby.  Also, a flap in the back protects them from the sun in that direction, while making it easy to peek down and check on them when pushing them.--The place where the straps click together has a little flap that velcros down over it.  Probably not necessary, but a nice feature.--The seat insert comes out VERY easily for washing.--The seat insert in a nice meshy type fabric that seems cool for hot weather.--The seat isn't as deep as the Vollo, meaning that smaller babies can ride in this without slumping over as much.  I know, they tell you to wait for 6 months to use these, but I was able to put my 3.5 month in here no problem because of the way the seat is made, its just more supportive than the Vollo.--Unlike the Vollo, this stroller has a built in stand, so that the stroller stands up when folded!  Wheels don't touch the sunshade or anything, so nothing gets dirty.--The fold is easy, although does require two hands.  The unfold can be done with one hand.
B0017NC77I I got this stroller for a international trip back to the USA with my 2 1/2 year old.  I needed a light umbrella stroller but didn't want to give up and get ones of those cheap 10 dollar ones.  I LOVE this stroller.  It is super light. It is really easy to fold up on my own and quickly when I am in line for security. The back basket was SO easy to get to.  I have tried to get into the backs of a Mclaren stroller before it was much harder.  This was a great buy and worth it for our trip. I love that the padding is removable for washing or for hot days.  I have noticed that since my trip my stroller doesn't stand on its own as well either.
B0017NC77I Like many reviewers, I chose the G-Lite narrowly over the MacLaren Volo.  After 3 months of use, I like the stroller quite a 
B0017NC77I I bought this stroller because it's so light and easy on my back!Here are the reasons I love it:-Super light-Easy to maneuver, even with one hand-nice large canopy-removable seat so you can wash easily-decent sized basket-Easy to open and close-Stands up when closed (This is SO nice!)I really have no complaints right now. We use the stroller for either quick trips outside or quick errands. The terrain around my house is pretty rugged, so we use our Vista for neighborhood walks. This is really just for me to be able to pop baby in the stroller if I want to run an errand or shop in a small store. Even though it doesn't recline, we decided it probably wouldn't matter for us since I only use for quick trips.**To address some problems people have had**Before purchasing I read that some people had problems with the basket catching on the closing mechanism, but I haven't had that problem. Also, I'm 5'3\" and haven't had problems kicking the wheels. My Father-in-law is much taller than me and my husband - He's around 6' and did kick the wheels quite a bit.**Money-Saving Tip**...Uppababy usually comes out with an updated line of their strollers every year around February/March I think. Check for sales on the older versions then; there are usually not that many worthy changes to the newer ones (though, sometimes there are). I know one year the only change were the color options, and they still lowered the price!
B0017NC77I The stroller image shown for Jake is for the higher priced g-LUXE model, not g-LITE....this model does not recline, has smaller black wheels, and not fold up footrest for infants. This listing is incorrect, hopefully they will correct it soon to show the actual item you receive.
B0017NC77I I went into a local stroller store with my heart set on buying the Maclaren volo and ended up walking out with this stroller instead.  The reasons I was going to get the Volo were1.  Lightweight--I needed a stroller to take on the subway that I might actually be able to carry up and down the stairs if i had too.  Our other stroller (City Mini) is fantastic but just too heavy for me to do that alone.2.  Mesh sides.  I wanted something that would be cool for summer since often I carry him in a Mei Tai but in the summer it just gets too hot.  I planned on getting a universal seat liner for the winter to insulate hiis back a bit.3.  Easily steerable with one hand.The reasons I ended up with the G Lite are1.  I picked up both strollers and this really did feel lighter--not by much but every bit helps.  Ultimately with all the accessories I2.  This has a cushy seat liner that is meshy and looks cool but is also a little padded.  BUT you can remove it and there is a full mesh only seat underneath, perfect for really hot days.  WIth this I don't need to worry about his butt getting too cold in winter and don't need to buy an extra piece (which only adds to the price) and I can have it be even cooler on very hot days.  Additionally the seat pad is included in the weight so the stroller only gets lighter if you remove it, while the Volo would just get heavier if you added one on.3.  The sun hood is not as big as with the Volo BUT it is pivotable so you can tilt it forward, the Maclaren can't do that.  Because of the way the back apron on the hood is set up it is easier to peek in on your baby in the stroller--I really hated that it was so hard to see him when he was in the Maclaren.  The sun hood doesn't seem like it is water resistant like the Maclaren but since I have to keep the raincover on us all the time for walking around the city it isn't a big deal.4.  I think it is easier to steer and turns more easily.5.  The basket is more accessible, though not quite as deep.6.  It folds so so so so much easier.  I always get really frustrated with Maclarens and folding, I just can't seem to do it easily.7.  I like that this can stand on it's own since our apartment isn't that big.8.  It comes with a cup holder.9.  The rain hood has a mesh panel in front of their face so you can flip the vinyl up there and some fresh air can get in.  I'm not a fan of vinyl stroller covers since you are basically enclosing your child in the very stuff we are trying to keep out of their toys, but they are a necessity.  When it is only lightly raining I always debate about whether to use it or not.  Since this sun hood really isn't water resistant it isn't really a debate with this stroller, but the lift up flap makes me feel like there is a little more ventilation going on in there.  There are also holes in the rain hood which I think are odd and I'm guessing are going to be annoying in a rain storm, but my son isn't made of sugar and I'd rather him get some fresh air and get a little damp from time to time.10.  The rain hood is lighter weight than the Volo's and since I carry it on the stroller all the time this makes the stroller even lighter still.11.  Price.  At my local store this stroller was 99 dollars and the rain hood 20 so all together it was $120.  The Maclaren is then $10 more (it came with a rain hood, but not all do).  But since I also was planning on buying a seat liner for winter it is actually a more significant amount.12.  construction.  After looking at the Uppa Baby the MAclaren fabric seems kind of cheap or flimsier.  On an old Volo that we inherited and were replacing (because it was falling apart) the seat fabric was falling off the hooks that attach it to the frame.  I would hook it back on and find it falling off again an hour or so later.  The Uppa Baby seat wraps around the frame so it seems sturdier.13.  Posture.  In the G Lite the baby sits more forward in the stroller than in the Maclaren.  But in the Maclaren he seemed more slouchy and hunched over.  His posture was better in this stroller and it seems to have better support.14.  The brakes.  I hate engaging the Maclaren brakes, these are much easier.  That is a much more safer option since I use them more frequently when it isn't a pain.And then as I pushed it home I discovered15.  Because the frame is structured so the babies weight is more toward the front of the stroller it doesn't seem to tip backward as easily.  The diaper bag I had on the handle bars stayed easily with my son in the stroller and there was no threatening to tip.  In our old Volo that was absolutely not true.  As I was pushing it I could feel it was back heavy and might tip if I let go.  I don't really recommend putting a diaper bag that heavy on the handlebars but it is nice to know this can accommodate a little more weight.Weighing the stroller with the sun cover, rain cover, cup holder, seat liner, and maclaren organizer it weighs 10 pounds.  The Volo with all these things would weigh at least 11.Everyone is different and will feel differently about these two very similar strollers, so I really recommend checking them out in person--you might change your mind too!
B0017NC77I I have an UppaBaby Vista for everyday and love it, so I got the G-Lite for shorter trips, mainly travel.  I love how light it is, and easy to carry with the carry-strap.  It's easy to fold and carry up and down stairs.  However, we've realized that we now need to buy another stroller for travel, because the G-Lite doesn't have recline.The 7 lb weight is simply amazing, but the stroller doesn't look cheap. It looks high-tech with its aluminum frame and bright colors.  The sunshade is great, really covering the baby.  And the fold, while two handed, is easy to do while holding the baby on my hip.  Also, thank you, Uppa, for adding a cupholder to this model.This stroller, however, sacrifices some features for its lightness.  You will not have a tray (not a problem for us), or any cushy strap-covers or pillows.  Also, for us, the big problem is that it doesn't recline.  We should have thought more about the G-Luxe, but we figured we'd use the Vista for day-long journeys.  Rather, when you travel and can't pack the Vista (or don't want to lug it in and out of the subway), the G-Luxe would have been a better choice.  Also, like all umbrella strollers, you shouldn't take your child out while the diaper bag is slung on the handles, as it will fall over.You see, we just took the G-Lite to NYC for the day.  It was great, with its kickstand, to fold up on the subway.  Slung over my shoulder, it was easy to carry up the narrow stairs at some of the stations.  We could fold it up at restaurants.  The underside basket is a little small but we were able to store a small bag down there.  However, the problem came in that my child could not nap in this stroller.  We had him all around Germany in a Teutonia, which reclines all the way like a bed, and he just took naps in it.  So we thought we'd have no problem on vacation in New York.  But with this stroller, he either lolled forward, or his head lay on the folding mechanism.  He slept very poorly and was in a terrible mood as a result.  We are now looking at other umbrella strollers with recline, like the Mac Quest and Uppa G-Luxe for our travel stroller.  Meanwhile, we will definitely keep the G-Lite in our trunks for quick mall jaunts.
B0017NC77I We love this stroller.  It is well worth the extra money.  It is light, attractive, has a bit of storage, and folds easily.  It has a great shoulder strap for carrying -- I carry it up and down 3 flights of stairs, daily, while I'm holding my one-year old and a diaper bag.  Unlike the UPPAbaby vista, which we also have, this one has a foot lock that is easy to work.  The harness is very easy to use.  My only complaint:  the cup holder broke off of mine.  But to be fair, I dropped the stroller on its side (without the baby in it!)  I highly recommend this stroller.
B0017NC77I This stroller is brilliant. It's very easy to set up, within a couple minutes you're ready to roll. The wheels turn on a dime. The handles are long enough for both my husband (6' and me 5'5\") and I to push without kicking the wheels. My daughter is 3 and loves riding in it. It's ability to stand up on it's own when folded makes it easy to take to restaurants or sports games and put it aside. The net underneath is big enough to store a kids backpack and your purse. It's great for travel, goes anywhere easily. We also have a quinny, that while I love it, this one is so much better for everyday use. It has all the benefits but is so much smaller and lightweight.Nevermind a one hand fold, this has a one finger fold. You pull the tab and it collapses, the safety keeps you from pulling the tab while anyone is in it. There's no cons for the stroller, I can't believe it's only $107!
B0017NC77I I purchased this in preparation of our up-coming airline and Disney trip and like it thus far.  Three things that really make this stroller stand out are: 1) Lightweight 2) Nice/functional sun canopy 3) Useable/accessible basket (I got rid of my Maclaren over the pathetic basket). This stroller is easy to fold and re-open and the stand up feature and shoulder carry strap are a plus.  The fold on this stroller doesn't achieve a complete flat fold like a Maclaren, but it is not far off.  My husband is 6'5\" and I am 5'5\" and we both find it easy to push without kicking the back wheels too.  This didn't happen for my husband with my former Maclaren Techo.  This stroller doesn't recline, but I am okay with that since my kids have never slept in a stroller.  Overall, I am happy with my purchase and my up-coming trip will really put it to the test.  My only wishes would be 1) built to handle more weight than 40 pound child 2)Optional snap on and tilt to one side so child could exit snack tray. 3)larger wheels to handle all terrain.Update --- stroller handled airline travel well and was great at Disney.  I had the stroller basket packed with snacks, clothes and towels and it did great!  One signficant problem I had was the seat fabric bunching up and getting trapped around the locking mechanism when folding the stroller which resulted in ripping the top and bottom of the seat in addition to putting a hold dead center where the locking mechanism was.  I called UppaBaby customer service and they were FANTASTIC! I took pictures of the damage and scanned my stroller receipt and emailed it to them.  I had a replacement stroller in three days!  Now that is customer service!
B0017NNSRQ This was to match the nursery theme in our new grandson's room! Just precious! I was very impressed at how well it was made. Stitching was close and tight and just perfect for a baby!!! It was quite a bit larger than I expected it to be and just adorable. Now he's almost a year old and he loves it too!!!
B0017NNSRQ I'm not so sure what all the hype is over this monkey. When I got him he felt very stiff to the touch, not soft and cuddly like stuffed animals should be. He's cute but not what I expected in a baby/toddler toy. I sent him back and had to pay about as much for shipping as the toy cost, so no refund there!
B0017NNSRQ This is a darling stuffed monkey and perfect for a young one if you take the ribbon off.  He is cute, soft and great for a young one because the face is stiched and painted on.  I bought it for my daughter who is decorating the babies room with a zoo theme.
B0017NNSRQ I bought this for my newborn daughter, though she's far too small (and unaware) for it yet. My 2-year-old son saw it, and loves it! So I may be buying a 2nd one for his little sister. Seems well-made and doesn't seem like it will fall apart quickly. As someone else noted, it has an un-removable \"necklace\" that says NoJo all the way around. Frustrating, but the animal itself is very good.Good animal, minus stupid necklace = 4 stars
B0017NNSRQ This monkey was pretty big and you cant take off the neck thing it has. Hes a cute monkey, but my kid didnt really seem to care for him.
B0017OAGHU I use this all the time for my mattress when a diaper leaks. It leaves my mattress smelling clean (a little strong-smelling, but I can live with that) and neutralizes the urine smell. No idea why it isn't carried in stores.
B0017OAGHU This is the best stain remover. Sometimes you have to scrub or soak it for a while but it gets out stains that I had trouble getting out with bleach even! I've found it in stores at Meijer, and Babies r us, and I think Walmart. Great product, I recommend it to all new moms!
B0017OAGHU I used it on a mattress. Followed instructions on bottle. Stains are still barely there, but absolutely no order left behind.I also use it on clothes.
B0017OAGHU Works well but its a little expensive. dawn dish soap works a little better and is a much cheaper option.
B0017OAGHU What i love about this is that you DO NOT have to let the remover soak and sit on it. You can JUST SPRAY IT & THROW IT RIGHT IN THE WASH! NO worries, Ive actually gotten to the point where after its done washing i wont even look to see if the stain is gone, i just know its vanished! LIKE MAGIC!
B0017OAGHU Does not get those tough stains out. Great for a toddler who doesnt spill/play in dirt but if your kids are like mine, they are filthy by the end of the day and this just wont cut it.
B0017P3LQW I bought this despite the bad reviews and I wanted to wait until I had really used it before I wrote a review to see how well it would hold up.  Now that winter is coming to an end, I have to say that I wouldn't have wanted to go through the winter without the 212 blanket.  Walking and subway are my primary form of transportation and my 1yr old son and I walk about one mile home together from daycare every evening so there is no way to avoid my son being out in some cold and windy weather.  I've used the 212 Blanket every day for the last 3 months and I've been very happy with it.  I did have a minor issue with the quality (there is a pacifier strap on the inside and the snap broke the first time I tried to use it) but other than that the Blanket is still like new.  I have a lighter weight stroller blanket (JJ Cole Urban Toddler Bundle Me - Stealth) for the spring and fall but I needed something more substantial that would stand up to a New England winter.  With the 212 Blanket my son is always warm no matter how cold or windy it is.  It also does a great job of keeping him dry if there's light snow.  The convenience factor of this product is huge.  When I pick my son up from daycare I don't have to worry about getting him to sit still long enough to wrangle him into a snow suit.  I put him in the stroller and zip up the blanket 212.  If it's really windy or cold then I'll also add a hat.  If I did a coat too it would be too warm most of the time, although I have added a coat once or twice when the weather was extreme.  If it's especially windy, I find my son will pull up the blanket to cover more of his face but most of the time we walk around and all you see is a little baby's face poking out of the stroller.  I like that it's an adjustable size so I can keep him warmer by keeping it snug.  The straps are very adjustable so I imagine it would fit most strollers well.  There are extra velcro attachments on the underside to help it stay put on the stroller.  I use it with my BOB Revolution and the only \"fit\" problem is that the sunshield on the stroller sometimes gets in the way of the hood of the blanket when I'm putting my son in or taking him out.  I could probably get around that if I unzipped and re-zipped the hood while putting my son in the stroller, but it's not irritating enough to warrant the extra effort.  In the next several weeks I'll probably be putting the blanket 212 into storage.  I can't imagine having gone through this winter without our blanket 212 and I look forward to using it again next winter.
B0017P3LQW We have had this product for about a month now in NYC, and it keeps my son very  warm and also seems to improve the quality of his stroller naps when we move him from one location to another.  They don't provide instructions on how to install this anywhere, which I find kind of annoying, so you just have to try to figure it out yourself.  Hence the 4 stars.
B0017P3LQW Great product - just what we needed for our daily walks in the city.  It fits the stroller great (we have a baby jogger mini and regular size too) and it keeps our 15 month old toddler nice and cozy.  It's machine washable, and adjustable so when we're ready we can lenghen it.  You can also zip open the hood and roll each side back, so it's nice to have that option.  We expect to use it for several winters.  Highly recommend this product.
B0017P3LQW Now that it served my son for almost four months, I can say that I like just about everything about this product - the look, the quality, the level of warmth it provides.  Highly recommend!
B0017P3LQW worked great in my bugaboo chameleon, almost too warm, a little big for a newborn. like that it's grows with my child.
B0017P3LQW I walk a lot with my family and we would not be as active during the cold weather without this bunting. It has been invaluable to me and my little ones during the winter.  It is very warm; perfect for children who dislike layers. Prior to owning the Blanket 212 I used aJJ Cole Urban Bundleme, Stealth, Infant. When my child outgrew the JJ Cole bunting I knew I needed something more substantial, I found this and I am glad I purchased it. Here is my list of pros and cons:Pros:- Very warm.- Doesn't slide down the seat when getting my child in and out.- Adjustable length and width- Looks great- Useful front pocket- Washable- Easily converts from toddler to baby sizeThe B212 has served us well for one child through 2 winters but now that I have a second baby I wanted to use this again and I have run into a few problems.Cons:- Not very durable. The bunting has begun to unravel at the seams of the hood and where the harness straps thread through the body of the bunting.- Hood isn't removable. This is important to me because my baby gets very hot while sleeping and sweats a lot from her head and neck.- Doesn't fit all of the strollers I own. Fits the City Mini and Mountain Buggy Urban but does not fit the UPPAbaby Vista or Cosatto umbrella strollers well.- When shortened to accommodate a baby the bottom is drafty.I still believe this item deserves 4 stars and I wouldn't hesitate to purchase this again. I used this with my first child from 18 months to 3 years and sparingly for my now 7 month old. I did contact 7A.M customer service about the seams unraveling and while they were unable to repair or replace the bunting the response was fairly quick and very cordial.
B0017S2S86 I've been using this mattress for six months and it's great.  There are no dents or impressions in it.  I am looking forward to being able to still use this when she is a toddler.
B0017S2S86 Really like this crib Mattress. Especially the 2 sidesInfant & toddler sides with different firmness.Got 1st mattress as a gift for daughter #1 & bought second one for baby#2!
B0017S2S86 DaVinci Emily II 2-in-1 6\" 242 Coil MattressI bought this mattress as a replacement of an older 2-in-1 mattress that my toddler used from birth (a Sealy from Babies R Us).  When it came time to purchase a new one, the Sealys were all sold out on Amazon, so I picked out this model as a \"next-best\" without remembering exactly how much I spent on the previous one.  The price seemed a little steep, but once I saw how much comparable models go for in stores, I felt a little better.It isn't as heavy as the previous mattress, and is actually a bit softer in the springs.  I am not sure what the coil count is for the other mattress.  I couldn't really detect any major difference in \"bounce\" from the infant to toddler side for either mattress.One thing I wish I'd looked into is whether it had a handle on the sides, which makes it easier for lifting in and out of the crib when you're changing the sheet.  This particular model does not, but it is still fairly easy to manage.So I guess I'd say this mattress is okay for quality, but you're probably just as well off buying a single sided mattress from the store and save your money.  There's rarely a huge difference on any of the 2-sided mattresses, and your toddler isn't likely to notice anyway.
B0017S2S86 I'm giving this product 3.5 stars. I received this along with the DaVinci Emily 4-in-1 Convertible Crib as part of my baby registry. I specifically wanted this mattress because of the value and fit to the DaVinci Emily crib. After reading existing reviews on multiple mattresses, I was concerned about the mattress fit in the crib since last thing I want are mishaps happening to my child. So after much research again and countless hours of reading consumer reports, I figured I can't go wrong with the fit if the mattress is also by the same manufacturer as the crib. I even measure the mattress area of the crib to make sure I got the exact measurements to that of what's published on the product description!The Emily 2 Sided Mattress was exactly what I had measured in the crib BUT when it arrived and I applied it into the Emily crib,the measurements are off from what's listed on Amazon's product details and the product box that it came in by a few centimeters on all 4 sides. Most parents might be fine with this considering how many other mattresses out there are off by inches rather than centimeters but considering baby safety, I was a bit concern of her fingers or toes getting stuck between the mattress and crib rails. So in the end, did I keep this product?I did - with some reinforcements to those centimeter gaps. I took up another reviewer's advice from another DaVinci mattress and stuck some towels on the side facing the wall, which worked perfectly and kept the mattress amazingly snugged in the crib with absolutely no gaps anywhere; and with the crib bumpers, you can't even tell there were towels involved!The big plus of this mattress I must add is 
B0017S2S86 After 4-month use, it is already sagging in middle. Fortunately, I am moving and so I will have to buy a new one, of course, a different one.
B0017S2S86 I got this mattress to match my Emily crib, figuring if I ordered the two products from the same manufacturer, there won't be any guess work with sizing issues (I read some reviews in which the mattress didn't fit the crib and didn't want to run into that problem). BUT...after about a month of using the crib, I noticed one day that there was a GAP between this mattress and my Emily crib, about a 1.5 inch gap if you pushed the mattress to either the right or left! I had to stick 3 rolled up receiving blankets in the gap so as to make the crib safer. I contacted Million Dollar Baby and submitted to them copies of pictures illustrating the gap and they're sending me a new crib altogether. I don't know if its the mattress or the crib not fitting. There should not be a gap. Besides the gap, the mattress seems to have \"memorized\" my son's body as there's a slight dent in the mattress where he sleeps. I'm not sure if that's normal or not. If I rotate the mattress I'm sure that problem will be solved. He sleeps on the Infant side of the mattress. Not sure if I would recommend this mattress because of the gap issue that I have (it could be the crib! But the crib looks properly assembled.)
B0017S2S86 We purchased this mattress for our Davinci Kalani crib.  It is a perfect tight fit in the crib.  The mattress seems firm and sturdy.  We have not used the mattress yet due to our daughter not being due for a few months.  I am happy with the purchase so far.  We will see how our daughter likes it when she is born...
B0017S2S86 This mattress was purchased for my grandson to be and fit my daughter's Lauren crib perfectly.  Delivery was quick but since baby is due any day we won't know much more until he arrives!
B0017S2S86 I did a lot of research before buying this baby mattress since our baby would spend a lot of time in it. This was the best choice for our budget. If you compare it to other mattresses that cost about 100 dlls you can see how this is on the top, others are a joke. The difference in the firmness, yet soft enough for baby, the 2 sided feature is definitely a plus, great coil count and it has the borderwire which is important for the life of the mattress and safety. It had everything I was looking for at a great price. Of course you could spend more and get a more natural or organic mattress but that was out of our budget, and this mattress is working just great.
B0017S2S86 One year later, this mattress has fared quite well. It looks and feels the same as when we bought it for our daughter, and she has had zero issues sleeping on it. We'll be flipping it to the other side in the near future. Couldn't be happier, especially for the price.
B0017S2S86 We were concerned about getting a mattress that would fit our crib just right, but this mattress fits our DaVinci Emily crib perfectly.  It seems firm and we look forward to using it with our child.
B0017S2S86 I bought this for my new DaVinci Emily Convertible Baby Crib. I was afraid that it will not fit since many reviews mentioned problems with mattresses. It fit perfectly. There is no gap. It was clean and in good condition when it came. It was wrapped in a plastic bag and it was in a box. It is very firm. I will update this review when my baby is born and we use it. So far so good.
B0017S2S86 Easy to clean, and the baby sleeps nicely upon a sheet upon a mattress protector upon the mattress.  No complaints.
B0017S2S86 This fits the Davinci Kalani crib perfectly.  So far this item has held up as expected.  Infant side is hard, as it should be.  I really can't complain about this item.  Looks waterproof, but it is worth it to put a water proof cover on it just in case.I would prefer a little more padding on the toddler side, but if it turns out to be a problem, I will put my own mattress pad on top when we flip it.  Who knows, our future toddler may prefer a firm mattress, we will have to see.
B0017T2RYU Would not purchase these again.  They had a loud buzz that came out of nowhere. We often ran into the room to find that there was nothing that trigger the sound.
B0017T2RYU Our nursery is on the top floor, and we have a receiver on the first floor and in the basement. The basement receiver seems to beep a lot but that can always be fixed by changing a setting on the switch or adjusting it's placement slightly. Both work well as long as we have them on a solid surface (placing them on end tables seems to work best) and these do the job exactly as intended. Would buy again.
B0017T2RYU Le me tell you this, if you buying this, you are buying a STATIC monitor, constantly buzzing and static ALL THE TIME!!! PIECE OF CRAP ever been made
B0017T2RYU After a lot of research, I chose this one because of the dual receivers and the rechargeable batteries. I love that the monitor and receivers plug in so I don't have to have a ton of batteries on hand.I keep one receiver down stairs and 1 in my bedroom. The sound quality is crystal clear and I haven't had any interference problems with my iPhone. I can even hear my son breathing most times, which is great for an anxious mom! I don't have a very large house, so I haven't had any problems with the range. I even took it out on the deck in my backyard and it still worked. I have been using this monitor for abour 2 months now and I am very happy with it.
B0017T2RYU We purchased these, and have found that they pop and crackle very loudly in the evening, to the point I have to just turn them off.  They worked well enough in the first year, but after 12 months, their speakers must have blown out.  We can't use these anymore.
B0017T2RYU Solid product.  Moniters work well.  Not \"perfect\"... like any other moniter.  But,very happy.
B0017T2RYU I love these monitors, and what a great price!  The voice activation is so cool, and they are so clear.  The work all over the house.  Because we live in the country, I am curious to see how far they will go on our yard.  I haven't had a chance to try it yet since it's winter here now, very cold and lots of snow.  But I am very impressed so far.  We had a very bad experience with a fisher price monitor set.
B0017T2RYU We've been using this for over two years and have been very happy.  We get good coverage all over our house (2 story + basement).  I can also take them outside in our yard and still stay within range.Some of my favorite features are that they have rechargeable batteries and an alarm to indicate if you are out of range.If you are having trouble with signal quality, spend some time with the various channel selections.  This made a difference for us.Also these will work along side the Fisher Price Sounds and Lights monitor without interference.Fisher-Price Sounds 'N Lights Monitor With Dual ReceiversThose are good monitors as well, but I prefer the Sony Baby C
B0017T2RYU This monitor has many of the features that I was looking for.  Rechargeable, dual hand sets and many channels.  The rechargeable handsets are great!  I'm saving so much money on batteries.  The dual hand set is fantastic because I don;t have to constantly carry it from bedroom to living room, although the snazzy belt clip works great!The problem is the reception.  It doesn't matter if you have this many channels if it's still fuzzy.  It gets fuzzy just from me walking around the room.  I'll roll over in bed at night and it gets fuzzy and the range alarm will go off.  The A/C comes on it gets fuzzy.  It has the same reception as the $20 monitor I used to have.  When I upgraded to a $65 version I was expecting better than this.  It remind me a lot of when I was a kid and we had rabbit ears on the TV.  Mom & Dad would make us stand in weird positions holding them so they could see.  My monitor is exactly like that.In the end I wish I had paid the extra $30 to get the kind that seamlessly changes channels so you never have any interference.  All the bells and whistles aren't worth it if I can't hear my baby.  That is the whole point after all.
B0017T2RYU Buy another monitor. I can't suggest one, because I reuse to spend another $60 on a heap of crap, but this set is worthless. This thing loses signal ALL THE TIME and has the most loud and annoying static and/or beeps constanly. We have lived in three homes while using this monitor, from a 1590 sqft townhouse to a 3,000 old farmhouse, and this monitor has been annoying and bothersome the entire time. Sure, I can hear my kid, but that's when the stupid thing isn't beeping or screaming static at me.  I could not in good conscience recommend this thing to anyone.
B0017T2RYU Bottom line this is not worth the money - the interference and feedback is way too much - even in a house with no other houses nearby.  Also it has a noise alert but no sensitivity function - so every time the baby makes a peep in turns on - which anyone who has a newborn will tell you means its going on every 10 seconds.  The bottom line is you want a monitor that lets you decide what you want to hear this does not let you do that.  Buy the Avent instead its has a great sensitivity function for only slightly more money.
B0017T2RYU It has button that is  off - voice activated - on.  On is continuous and voice activated is only when your baby is making noise.  Sometimes it picks up on the space heater in our baby's room and that will come through when the voice activated is on.  It will interfer with other signals - if my cell phone is close it will make awful sound.  We haven't had troubles with microwave interfering like other reviewer said.  I would say keep other items that emit signal about 4 feet away and it shouldn't interfere.We have great range at all levels of our house.  Works from basement to 2nd floor without range issues.  It will beep at you if it can't pick up on monitor.  Slide buttons on bottom let you choose different channels.  I love the battery and plug in options of this unit.  The stationary unit with baby isn't battery operated which is a huge downside - you must keep monitor away from crib at least 3 feet for this reason.  The cord can be a choking hazard (I know one more thing to worry about).
B0017T2RYU I have to keep buying new ones because the wires are very sensitive to toddler wear. But this is the biggest bang for your buck! They work fantastic, sensitive, but very reliable.
B0017T2RYU These serve their purpose, yes, but almost every night, every 5-15 minutes, ours picks up some static signal and just blips a loud static noise in the middle of the night. I've gotten used to it, but it's still annoying. They have two settings on them, one that is constant stream so that you can hear every little noise that goes on in your baby's room, or you can set it to voice activation where only noises up to a certain volume level make the monitor turn on, which is what we have it set on. The sudden bursts of loud static occur regardless of which setting it is on, and it has 3 channels to switch back and forth between if your signal sucks. These do have a really great range! A friend of ours has the same ones, (she also has the static problem) but when she had a pool party at her home for one of her daughter' birthdays, her younger daughter and my son took naps in the middle bedroom of her home, and we took turns clipping the speakers to our belts and going outside to see the rest of the party. These picked up the signal all over my friend's very large backyard, and they have a clip on the back of them so you can strap it on to your pants while you keep busy. Here is my recommendation to save money for many people: Don't do what we did and automatically assume that you need to purchase the larger set with the two speakers in it. We live in a 2 bed/2 bath one story condo that is just about 1200 square feet. It is a very open layout, but a split floorplan, so our room and my son's rooms are the furthest points in the home. We assumed that we would keep of course the receiver in my son's room, one speaker in our room, and the other speaker in the living room/kitchen area, but with the static problem, we didnt want a speaker right by where we were sleeping. Everytime it spazzed out, we woke up, so we put away one of the speakers and just have the one speaker on the bar in the middle of our home, right inbetween the kitchen and living room, and not too far away from our bedroom door, same volume we had before. We can hear our son JUST FINE. I considered not even using these at all, because I can actually hear my son quite well just from his room to mine, but I am scared I will sleep through it having gotten used to that amplified \"fuss\" from the monitor. For people living in small, or compact floor plans, save a little money and just purchase the smaller set of this with one speaker. This one would be perfect for someone with a 2-story home, one for each level. Infact, my mom bought these same ones for when my son stays at her house, and her home is a 2-story. Oh, and the battery life is quite good too. It lasts for several nights without needing to be charged.Overview: These work, therefore I trust them and would use them, but I don't like whatever ours are picking up. This problem may not be the same for everyone, as we may be picking up some weird signal around our home, but I did fine it interesting that a friend of ours who lives 30 miles away had the same issue with the exact same set. The range is great, battery life is good, but really think about which set fits your needs for your living situation.UPDATE: I figured out the static issue. If you have the monitor on while it is plugged in and charging, it makes this terrible static sound the entire time. Charge it before you have to use it, and then unplug it and the battery will last 3-4 nights, static only about 5% of the time compared to 50% before! I'm raising it one star. : ]
B0017T2RYU When we had our first child 6 years ago, we had no money and bought the cheapest monitor they had at the store, which I believe was a parent's brand monitor. I had no issues with it (aside from a low steady static buzz when it's on, which never bothered me because I sleep with a fan anyway). Fast forward five years. We have our second child and decide to buy a new one. We buy the sony one thinking it will be a high quality unit. Wrong.I couldn't even get through the first night before turning the thing off and deciding to take it back. A lot of reviews I've read have mentioned a lot of beeping. I never heard the beeping, I imagine because we didn't have it long enough to hear beeping. All I heard was a lot of random clicks and pops that originated from the machine itself. It also amplifies every last noise in my house. Crickets. The house settling. The air conditioning switching on. A car alarm down the block. The baby sighing. Noises that are so faint that I would barely hear them without the monitor are amplified greatly. All I want to hear is the baby, and not the little noises, I need to hear her crying loudly. Between the monitor amplifying too much noise and creating it's own noise, it's impossible to get any sleep.We ended up digging out the old monitor and using it. It lasted about another year before it finally gave out. We couldn't find the same one, so we bought the cheapest one we could find at walmart and it works okay. I don't know if they still make the parents brand monitor, but it was a good basic model and we had barely any issues with it.But I don't recommend the Sony monitor. I couldn't even make a single night with it before taking it back and I had to fight the urge to smash it to bits.
B0017T2RYU This is the best baby monitor ever! I tell everyone I know that this is the one to buy. Now using it for my second child and it is still working great. It is also really nice to have 2 receivers so I don't have to move them from room to room. No complaints whatsoever, this is a fabulous product!
B0017T2RYU I am really disappointed with this monitor and wish I had retained the box so that a return could be made.  I have been using it now for about four months in our relatively small home, but the range is terrible.  The initial receiver is located in the living area (only a few feet from the baby's room) and that location has good reception.  However, the second receiver is in our room about 20 feet further away and through one wall.  There are no other devices located near this receiver and yet it gets almost no reception.  We have tried moving it around the room (as close as is possible to the babies unit) nothing works.  Also, there is no apparent failure pattern which would help us determine the cause of the problem.  It simply works for a little while and then for no discernible reason begins to sound the out of range signal.  My advice is to pass this one by.
B0017T2RYU This monitor was okay, but it gets a lot of feedback (buzzing, loud clicks, and a lot of static) that it shouldn't get. It is very sensitive, which is good and bad, because I can hear my baby yawning and sometimes breathing, but it also picks up the dogs (several houses) away barking at night. It does it's job, but I wish I could return it for a different one. We've tried several different settings, and nothing works. I think my cell phone also interferes with it, so I have to put it away from the phone. I think the worst part is having to immediately turn it off, before opening the door to my baby's room, if I leave the monitor on, it starts making a loud high pitched tone and doesn't stop till I turn it off. Our rooms are across a very short hallway from each other, so I don't think it's good for small places. I need the monitor though because I am a very heavy sleeper once I manage to pass out. Very disappointing after reading good reviews on this product.
B0017T2RYU After our three year old Philips Avent died, we decided to buy a cheaper baby monitor. After much research, I found that every monitor available has a wide range of high and low star ratings. It seemed that none was an excellent choice, but the 'Sony 900 MHz BabyCall Nursery Monitor with Receivers' and the 'Graco Secure Coverage Digital Monitor - 2 Parent Units' were the two we tried out. Both were appealing because they include two receivers and both had generally high ratings from a large number of reviewers. Sadly, the reality is that the Philips Avent DECT technology is the only monitor that offers zero interference and crystal clear sound. It's a bummer, but in this case you do get what you pat for. The Sony and the Graco both produced continual (and very annoying) interference noise and both beeped and changed channels a lot. Our son slept beautifully, but we were woken up throughout the night from the monitors. The sound on the Avent is so clear that I can hear my son breathing and turning/moving in his bed. I never have to worry when I'm not in the room and I always hear him when he calls for me at night. The only downside to the Philips is the battery life off the charger is ~3hrs, other than that it's excellent.
B0017T2RYU I absolutely LOVE this monitor set! I have used it with my twin boys since birth. It is very sensitive to sound which is perfect for hearing baby. We use 'white noise' (a fan and vaccum cleaner noise CD) in the room they sleep in and it doesn't interfere with the signal or sound quality. I have dropped the monitor too many times to count and it still works perfect!! There is a range alarm on the monitor that tells you when you're getting out of range, but I've never had it alarm (signals with a beeping noise and red light). I've took the monitor to my neighbors house which is 40-50 ft away and it never alarmed. I like that it is rechargable and doesn't use batteries! Saves tons of money in the long run since we are constantly putting batteries in toys.It has 3 setting on the side: Off, On, and voice activated. We only use the voice activated. It also comes with 3 channels if for some reason you do experience interference. Also there is a volume control that lets you turn it up if so needed.I would HIGHLY recommend this product! We live in a very noisy household with t.v's, cell phones, microwave, etc.. and we have NEVER had a problem!! The sound quality is absolutely perfect as well... I can hear my baby turn over as well as when he sucks his pacifier! A must have with little ones!
B0017T2RYU We have been using this baby monitor for almost 8 months.  At first we thought it was going to be a good fit for us.  It seemed almost too sensitive to noises, the red lights would flash when the baby rolled in her crib.  But the \"out of range\" light would flash and it would intermittently beep.  It wouldn't beep consistently though, seemingly only at night.  The clicks, pops and crackles are horrendous and wake us up frequently.  With the baby sleeping through the night we often resort to turning off the monitor at night, completely defeating the purpose.  Almost 8 months of use and it is now not picking up the babies noises very well.  I can hear the baby through the wall before the monitor picks up her sounds.  We have tried multiple channels to try and get rid of any interference but nothing seems to help.  About to chuck this monitor and replace it with something that will work.  Don't waste your money on this, read reviews carefully and go for something else.
B0017T2RYU We've been using this monitor about 22 months now and have found it to be way more frustrating than useful. Sometimes it will work at long range, but most times it loses signal even IN THE NEXT ROOM. Like it becomes easier just to listen unassisted for the baby crying than to put up with all the beeping and static and clicking from this dumb monitor. Our house is fairly new, so our walls are just drywall, not anything that would occlude a decent signal. Definitely going to toss this and get something else for the next kid.
B0017T2RYU This monitor is just okay. Its does the very basic which is let you hear when your baby is crying. But I wasn't expecting all the other noises this thing made. At very random times this monitor will have a very loud \"clicking\" sound, loud enough wake me up, but I am a light sleeper, even still, its loud. And the range isn't all that great, but we never go very far anyway. I've not used it very much cause our baby still sleeps with us and doesn't really take naps unless its on me, but I've heard the clicking enough to know that its not the best out there, and you should probably invest elsewhere.
B0017T2RYU After owning a defective more expensive monitor, I was skeptical about this one.  The reviews were a bit mixed and had me worried about interference and the range alarm going off.  We have had this for 2 months now and use it mutiple times every day.  It works great!  I especially like the convenience of having 2 receivers, with a multi-level home, this is a must!  And the long range is amazing!  We were even able to hear our baby whimper in her crib from our neighbor's, 3 houses away!  I have often walked right outside her door while holding a receiver and the alarm has never gone off.  And I have had no interference with this either; it is often sitting right next to my cell phone and right below our microwave with no problems.  Great monitor, don't hesitate on buying this one!
B0017T2RYU Ok, the voice setting on this makes it all worth it.  We have a problem like some of the other reviewers - we get static and beeping out of range in a 2500 sq ft house.  But the voice setting is awesome - no more static!  We had some crappy fisher price lights/sounds monitor that crackled all day long, this is silence until the baby starts talking/crying.  love it!
B0017T2RYU I did not buy this monitor from Amazon.  We purchased this in 2008 and for no reason at all it stopped picking up the stations. It did not last a year.  I just had another baby in April and I pulled this thing out trying to see if I could get it to work. I tried all kinds of color combinations with no luck.  I am now looking for another monitor...looks like Vtech may be the one. I just don't know how this thing is supposed to work when you can't get a channel no matter where its placed in the house. It was never dropped or anything...never again...Sony in my opinion failed with this one.
B0017T2RYU I moved my son to his crib around 3 months, and with this monitor, I can hear everything in the room including his breathing and the clock ticking. I sleep much better at night because it's been most reliable.It's true that you can get interference from other electronic devices, so I don't charge my cell phone next to the monitor on my nightstand. With a little experience, you can figure out what causes interference and make the necessary adjustments. After I did, I rarely have issues with interference. (I live in a house in a rural town so I can't speculate on how it would work in a condo, apartment complex, or densely populated neighborhood.)I haven't tried other monitors, but I'd rather have something that monitors closely, has good battery life, etc. than have something that can't help me know exactly what's happening in the nursery.
B0017T2RYU initially we had static problems, but the monitor was too close to the cordless phone. when I moved it a few feet away, we were fine.sometimes there is a little bit of static when receiver is close to something electronic, so i just move it farther away
B0017T2RYU We bought this monitor because its Sony and I figured it would be good. Its driving me crazy. It has bursts of static on every channel! We've tried moving the monitor, moving the receiver, nothing helps. It happens on all 27 channels! Its driving me crazy! I can't get any sleep!!One of the other reviews said do not buy if you live in an apartment. For the record, we live in an apartment building too. Not sure if it would do the same thing in a house.... but I'd pick a different monitor!
B0017T2RYU Overall, good product if you don't want a video monitor.  Looking back, I wish we bought a video monitor as our 9 month old is very active in his bed and I would prefer to see what he's up to on a video monitor rather than walking into his room every time.
B0017T2RYU After buying and returning three different monitors we tried the Sony BabyCall.  A couple friends recommended it and we were running out of options.  The sound on this monitor was pretty good for an analog signal.  The problem is that the out of range alarm (a really loud, annoying beeping) kept randomly going off as we walked around our house.  We have a single floor home that isn't huge.  There is no way the receivers were actually out of range.  We tried exchanging our Sony BabyCall for another unit hoping we had gotten a faulty one, but the second one was even worse than the first!  I couldn't even leave the receivers on because they beeped non-stop.  It could be that we have too many devices operating on the analog signal for this to work for us, but other analog monitors did not have this problem.  Don't bother with the Sony BabyCall.
B0017T2RYU This is my second monitor purchase of this product. It picks up movement and sounds well and clear. Other than the occasional beeps we never really had any problems with it until about a year and half of use.  The receiver started making more static and also popping sounds around other electrical sources such as in the kitchen. A few months later it wouldn't work with just battery power only. I ordered a new battery but that didn't fix the problem. This time we ordered this set with 2 receivers which I definitely recommend. Depending on where you live and the environment of your home, any monitor can have issues and may or may not be the best one for you. We have been pretty happy with this monitor.
B0017T2RYU While there are some superficial flaws with this product (especially that the loop on top of the receivers is actually the antenna, and you can't use it to hang from your belt loops or anything convenient like that), it seems to work very well. We get crystal-clear reception everywhere in the house, even the basement.Unfortunately, the proximity alarm sounds if we're any farther than about 20 feet from the baby's room. If i'm going to stay that close, i don't need a monitor to hear what's going on in there. What good is a baby monitor that lets me go out of earshot of the baby long enough to be productive if it's constantly beeping at me?
B0017T2RYU When I picked out this monitor, I expected high quality because of the Sony name and higher price.  I liked this one because it had two receivers and we wanted to put one in our basement and one in our upstairs master rather than always trying to keep track of the receiver.  We are replacing it after 6 months.THE MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENTS:- Constant interference.  No matter what channel we set it to, it seems like the slightest noise may cause interference.  This is annoying because every time the receiver loses its signal for a millisecond it beeps at you.  This can be a lot of beeping when you are trying to sleep -- something any new parent doesn't want to lose because of technology.  The monitor beeps at least once 5-6 days a week in the middle of the night and wakes us up.- Volume sensitivity.  The volume is very sensitive.  We try not to ever adjust it because it is very difficult to get it adjusted so that it is low enough that you can't hear the baby breathing, the clock ticking... things you don't need to hear and that are distracting when you are trying to sleep.  If someone adjusts the volume even once it is at least a week before we get it tweaked just right.  Twice we have woken up to see the red visual lights on full blast and we can hear the baby screaming through the floor.Thanks Sony for putting a worthless product on the market.  I only wish we'd have packed this up after the first few days and returned it.  We just kept thinking another channel would solve the interference problems but it never did.
B0017T2RYU We have never had a problem determining if the baby is awake with this monitor.  The sound is clear and loud with minimal static.
B0017T2RYU Purchased this from EZ something or other.  The shipping was very fast.  Anyway, I can hear my baby's breathing with this monitor.  And the volume isn't turned way up.  The nursery is approx 10' x 10'.  The transmitter is in a corner of the room diagonally opposite the crib where baby's head is. We have had it for 10.5 mths.  Now he turns on his side and I can't hear the regular breathing but deep breaths do come across.  There is no static.We have a 2 story house so this works great.  Have unplugged one monitor and forgotten to plug it back in for 24 hrs and the battery does not drain.  Outside of the house, the range seems to be ~ 40ft or so.  No interference with TV or cell or other devices.  I have taken a receiver into the basement frequently and it works well there (while taking a shower).  Transmitter is on the 2nd floor.  Shower is on opposite side of the house ~ 26 ft away.There is a voice activated mode so that if you have a fan or humidifier in the room, it filters out the background sound.  I wanted to hear everything so haven't used that mode much.  The regular mode did pick up a drip problem with a humidifier that wasn't seated correctly.I love this monitor and it's one of the top baby products I've purchased if not the best.
B0017T2RYU This is the worst monitor ever! It beeps, clicks, and makes all kinds of noise. It is actually doing it right now while my daughter naps and once again i am going to have to get up and reposition it! Read all the bad reviews and trust them. Dont take a chance on this one! Its crap. I would give it zero stars but it is making me choose one to rate it, so i picked one star.
B0017T2RYU It was okay.  Would have loud feedback everytime it got within proximity of a cell phone.  Could hear the tick of the second hand clock with this device so it was fairly sensitive.  The automatic sound activation was always kind of questionable.  However, one of the receivers suddenly stopped working at 11 months - there was no warning or anything to indicate that it had stopped working as all the indicator lights were still on.  The fact that it could stop working so suddenly is kind of disturbing, potentially dangerous.
B0017T2RYU This monitor works for us just like it's supposed to, and I'm comfortable enough using it that I no longer feel like I have to be with my sleeping baby every second.  The voice recognition feature works well, so you don't have to listen to background noise all the time (though you don't have to use the voice recognition mode if you do want to hear all of the background noises).  While there are, of course, monitors out there with more features, this one has everything we needed, works well, and is a very good value for the price.  I think the design is cute, too, and like the rechargeable batteries.  Also, we were able to get the receivers to pick up the transmitter's signal on the second setting we tried, and there are 27 settings, so no problem there.
B0017T4PXG we bought this product to keep our baby food cold while flying. this worked fantastic. i would definitely recommend it.
B0017T4PXG We love this tote for the diaper bag. You can customize the inside to hold 2 (4 oz bottles) and 2 jars of baby food, 2 (8 oz) bottles, or 6 jars of baby food. Each of the dividers comes out. And, later on, the middle divider will lay flat so you can use the whole tote.
B0017T4PXG Love it! It is so versatile that all of my baby's feeding bottles and food tupperwares fits in there. Most important, does the job of keeping temperature for several hours.
B0017T4PXG This is one of the best presents we recieved at our shower.  I love that you can remove the dividers to make different size bottles fit.  I would highly reccomend purchasing this product.
B0017T4PXG I like the functionality of the cooler bag. I plan to use it for bringing expressed milk back home from work, as well as when my baby starts on solids, I can bring home-made baby food out.The dividers materials just seems to be a bit poorly made. Also the one I got the left side seemed a bit asymmetrical.It's okay for the price.
B0017T4PXG I used this one a lot for traveling, very convenient. However, I didn't get to use it for as long as I though I would. My girl is 18 months now, and she prefers fresh fruit and veggies, so we cannot go for jars bought at the store. Still this tote was awesome for many of our trips.
B0017T4PXG The bag is nice for holding different size bottles and compact enough to take around with you.  I don't feel it keeps things super cold.  If you are planning on using it more than 2 hours at a time, then this probably is not the bag for you.
B0017UZZ5C I will admit that I was sorely tempted to buy the original Fisher Price stacker, the one we all had as kids.  It's absolutely a classic and I may still obtain one of them.But I was drawn to this one for my 5-month old because I remember reading somewhere that it is slightly smaller than the classic version with the large plastic hollow donuts.  I thought smaller might work better for the little guy.  Well.  Since this toy has come into the house, not a day has gone by without at least one play session where he selects this toy to play with from among a lot of others.Now 8 months old, he still loves this one.  He tips over the base to let the rings fall free, takes one in each hand, and shakes them like tambourines.  He smacks them together and has a grand old time.  He is not at all interested in re-stacking them on the base, but that's fine with me because it just means the toy will last a while longer while he grows into that phase.The topper on this stacker is the red ring with the little chick.  This part does not rattle, which is a little bit of a shame.  It also wedges kind of tightly onto the top of the base, so baby can't remove it himself, but that's OK.I am very very pleased with this purchase.  I have subsequently looked at some of the other stackers on the market and I am convinced this one is the cream of the crop.UPDATE:  Eddie is now 17 months old and a month or two ago, he started stacking the rings on the stump.  He still needs help deciding the order they should be placed on the stump but he's had a lot of fun trying to get this thing figured out.  Still a hit in our household.UPDATE:  Eddie is turning 4 next week and only today did I pull this one out of the toy basket  :-( .
B0017UZZ5C Baby is 8 months old, and I didn't think she would really be that interested in this toy yet.  I just wanted her to begin to grasp the \"stacking\" concept. But she loves to play with the round stackers. They rattle, and she likes to chew on them. It is one of her favorite toys.  I put it in her crib in the morning, and it keeps her occupied so I can get an extra 10 to 20 minutes of sleep.
B0017UZZ5C My 7 month old loves the rattling sounds from all the rings. They are a little heavier than the other products in the market. My son threw them down on my feet a couple of times and it hurt. The duck on top does not stay on and the rings  can only be fixed in one order coz the stem inside is tapering on the top and thick at the bottom.  This is one of the few toys that my son likes so i still think it was a decent buy.
B0017UZZ5C Got this as a gift for friends' infant.  My wife had seen its popularity in other homes with young children.  It was immediately a hit and the baby loved it. That's what it is all about!
B0017UZZ5C I just wish that for a first stacker the material was a little softer.  My babe is in the phase of banging everything, and she hits herself and me with the rings and it hurts us both.  I just wish the plastic was a little softer.  Otherwise it's cute, the rattles are nice.
B0017UZZ5C i like it its colorful and work as rattle as wellmy 7 month baby likes it and its really nice and good priceloves it
B0017VM2NY I am posting because I disagree with some of the negative reviews I read here. I have no problems with my car seat and other moms frequently comment on how much easier my system looks than the seats they use.1. I love that I can take my sleeping daughter grocery shopping without having to remove her from the car seat and wake her. I rotate the base, release and tilt it and then plop it into the stroller. Easy-peasy--and I'm a 130lb mommy, so I must disagree with reviewers who said it is hard to travel with the base.2. The reviewers who complain about twisted straps make no mention of the Velcro holders. Perhaps they aren't aware of them? When I remove my daughter, I push the straps to either side of the seat and they stick to the Velcro awaiting our return. No twisting or fussing. Perhaps they didn't notice the Velcro dots since they mimic the seat logo?3. Regarding the seat incline, I saw my daughter's head hang once when she was asleep and my inlaws had buckled her in. It turned out they had completely loosened her straps. I always do the finger test when tightening her straps and then her head stays against the back cushions.4. Other mothers complain about the durability or inconvenience of cleaning other brands of car seats, and I think the reviewers don't realize how easy we've got it. Not only do I have peace of mind over safety and toxicity, but I can unzip everything and throw it in the wash in two minutes.I actually keep a counter clicker attached to my stroller and every time someone remarks on how smart the design is, I click it. I'm already in the three hundreds.In one respect, I do share the concern of the one star reviews. I am disappointed that I will eventually be forced to turn the seat, not because my daughter demands it but because the highest shoulder height straps only work forward facing. I find that to be the one flaw of the system, but my daughter is in the 98th percentile for height and I supposed rear-facing until three should be good enough.
B0017VM2NY I am very disappointed. I love orbit but this seat was impossible, no recline and the handle is to stiff to turn it. My son head was in his lap! I returned it and went with the 360 and am very happy.
B0017VM2NY I don't even know where to begin - basically, it is a horrible car seat. I would like to slap myself for ever falling for the bells and whistles of the swivel/dock feature Orbit is so proud of. I recommend you to stay away from Orbit, the toddler car seat in particular. Your wallet will thank you and you will save yourself a headache. If you feel like reading why, go ahead.We have the Orbit Baby G2 travel system (the frame, the base, and the infant car seat) and felt somehow trapped as we thought since we already have the expensive base we should get the Orbit toddler car seat to put it to further use (our 12-month old baby is getting too big for the infant seat). Unfortunately, we were unable to see the toddler car seat in person because no retailer seems to have a floor model of this thing. I was hesitant to order it online so we went to a store hoping we would be able to take it out of the box to further examine its functions because I wasn't sure whether it has a recline function (Orbit website does not mention this function at all). So we went and were told by the shop that they do not have a floor model (surprise) and that the box cannot be opened. So I asked a few questions and was assured and reassured that it does, indeed, recline into a very comfortable position to accommodate babies and small toddlers. We paid almost $400 ($360 + NYC tax) and brought this thing home where we discovered that it DOES NOT RECLINE!!! I was furious because I asked 3 different sales persons and all of them assured me that it does recline. Every other convertible car seat on the market has a reclining function, especially at this price point. And frankly, for almost $600 ($360 seat + $220 base) it should recline automatically when I say \"recline\".  The seat is so upright I do not understand that Orbit says it is designed for babies from 15 pounds! No way. My son was 15 pounds when he was only 3.5 months old. There is absolutely NO WAY a 3-month old baby would ever be comfortable in an upright position when they can't even sit. Actually, they shouldn't be in an upright position this early at all! I tested the seat with my 12-month old son who weighs 22 pounds now and measures 31 inches (BTW, the infant car seat is for babies up to 30 pounds or 32 inches, so he's only 1 inch away, and frankly, he's not very comfortable in it anymore). Do you think my 12-mo/22-lb/31-in baby was comfortable in his new toddler car seat? ... No, he was not. We drove for about half an hour (we couldn't take it longer), he slept and his poor head was literally resting on his chest. It looked horrible and very uncomfortable. For those who think it is normal, let me assure you that it is not. I have used Chicco and Maxi-Cosi convertible car seats in Europe and they all recline, so I have never experienced this problem. I knew instantly I would be returning this seat. Which is exactly what I did.I only owned this seat for 4 days, therefore I didn't get a chance to experience any problems with the belt twisting as reported by other reviewers.Another major con is that this seat has only 4 harness slots to adjust harness height (of which only the lower 2 are allowed for rare facing installation)! That's totally inadequate - other convertible car seats offer more than double (Britax Next Generation: 10 slots, Maxi-Cosi Pria: 11 slots). This important detail (along with the fact that it doesn't recline and that you can't use the swivel base while forward facing) is conveniently not mentioned at the Orbit Baby website. You'll discover this when you take the seat out of the box and read the manual.I contacted Orbit because I am still in shock that such an expensive car seat from a company that claims to be so innovative lacks standard features. I wrote an email which included the following:\"... What is a consumer supposed to do if his/her baby's head is literally resting on its chest while sleeping in the seat - this looks super uncomfortable for the baby and seems unsafe too. Normally, I would recline the seat. But Orbit does not allow me to do that. Why not and what is supposed to be done instead to make the baby comfortable? I tested the toddler car seat with my 12-month old who weighs 22 pounds and measures 31 inches - the toddler car seat is too upright and the poor baby was sleepy and his head was falling on his chest all the time. We have your infant car seat, which has a good angle, but he's outgrowing it and we need a new seat for him. The current seat angle of your toddler seat seems sort of OK for bigger toddlers, maybe around 2 or 3 years, but what am I supposed to do during the \"in-between\" stage from 12 months up to 2 or 3 years, when he's too big for your infant seat, yet too small for your toddler seat due to the non-existing recline...\"Brace yourself for the response and suggestions I received from Orbit...\"We are not aware of any convertible car seats that have a recline position.\" ... Really??? How about Britax, or Maxi-Cosi to name a couple (they have the same safety features like Orbit, such as the EPP foam and side impact protection). Britax, for instance - all of their convertible car seats allow 3-position recline both while rear and forward facing. Maxi-Cosi PRIORI model has 4 recline positions when forward facing. Maxi-Cosi PRIA 70 has 3 recline positions - position 3 (most reclined) and 2 (medium recline) can be used while rear facing. Position 2 (medium recline) must be used while forward facing for children up to 40 pounds. Position 1 (upright) must be used while forward facing for children over 40 pounds. Interestingly, Maxi-Cosi seems to believe (just like me ... or maybe it's just common sense) that toddlers/children up to 40 pounds should be seated in a more reclined position. Their website explains it as follows: These recline positions allow a more reclined riding position for younger children and a more upright position for older children. Not only does this provide an appropriate riding position for different sized children, but the required recline angles also improve crash energy management.On the head falling forward: \"We understand your concerns and see the same phenomenon when our own children nap using the Toddler Car Seat.\" ... Phenomenon?!  More like a poorly designed, overpriced car seat that lacks BASIC features!\"We have never received any information - from pediatricians or otherwise - that when children sleep in these seemingly awkward positions, it is somehow bad for them.\" - Uh, how about just incredibly uncomfortable!?\"There are many general techniques that you can use so that your child is more comfortable. Some include a towel, foam wedge, or pool noodle that can be used to prop the Base.\" - A pool noodle???  Are you kidding me? No, thank you, I will not be sticking any towel or pool noodle under the car seat base. The towel/pool noodle option doesn't seem safe and frankly it is a very sloppy solution for a $600 ensemble and to be honest I am appalled by their suggestion.Rather than a pool noodle, I will get a different car seat. I am extremely disappointed with the Orbit system due to its lack of otherwise standard features. The fact that they are not aware of the reclining function tells me that Orbit is way behind its competitors.FYI: If you think the rotating feature is cool and you are planning to buy it for that reason, please don't. This function does not compensate for the many disadvantages of the seat and frankly, you can only use the rotating function when rear-facing. Once forward facing, the rotation-allowing base cannot be used anymore, nor will you be able to dock the seat into the stroller frame (unless you want to install it over and over again which is beyond annoying). Hence, once forward facing, the famous swivel feature cannot be utilized.And if you think you can just grab the toddler car seat, lift it with your sleeping child in it and dock it into the stroller frame, then trust me, you can't unless you are the Incredible Hulk. The seat is very bulky and heavy (22 pounds), I struggled with it alone, I would never be able to lift it from the back seat (a very awkward angle) with a toddler in it. Never.Update 02/2012 - after an extensive and exhausting 6-month research we finally purchased a Maxi-Cosi Pria 70 Convertible Car Seat in Walnut Brown and we are very pleased with it. In fact, I am so happy with it I gave it 5 stars.
B0017VM2NY We had the Orbit infant car seat system, but my son weighed 21 lbs, 4 oz. at his 6-month appointment, so we had to move up to the toddler seat.The good things:- It works with the same base so long as you have the seat rear facing (since our son is only 7 months old, we'll have him facing backwards a while longer)- I LOVE that you can turn the seat 90 degrees in the base to get him in and out of the car -- I've watched my friends with rear-facing convertable seats contort themselves to get their babies strapped in while I can stand comfortably at the side of the car;- Because the base system still works, we're able to get away with using one car seat for two cars- You can use it with the stroller base (handy when the baby is sleeping and you don't want to wake him up to put him in a stroller)- it has velcro tabs to keep the straps out of the way when getting the baby in and out of the seatThe not so good things:- It is heavy.  I have a really hard time lifting it in and out of the car, especially with the baby in the seat;- You can use it with the stroller, but it looks really strange, plus it is hard to haul in and out of the car;- It is really big and, especially with the sun shade, blocks the side window view;- You can't use the base forward-facing (when our son turns 1, we'll just install this seat permanently in one car and buy a Britax for the other car).Thus, if you already have the infant system and a younger baby that has outgrown the infant car seat, this is a good option.
B0017VM2NY My car seat journey started 11 1/2 years ago. I was told to get a Britax and I stuck with that until  I just got my car seat last week and we love it! We replaced a Britax Advocate. So, the people that have said it is too big should try one of those, it needs it's own zip code!  I am not convinced in the car seat that bigger is better! I sold her Advocate because with 4 in car seats it was just too big. I got a Britax Boulevard but then I saw the Orbit seats and got the infant. Started saving for the Orbit toddler but we were in a very minor fender bender the insurance of the person that hit me paid to replace my seats.  Although they depreciated them even the ones I just bought, I got the Infant seat again, and the Toddler seat in Mocha because the black is not in stock.  Turns out I love the mocha!  Anyway, like all of the Orbit products it is great quality.  I can not see myself getting this thing out to put on the stroller, that said it is a great option for people who fly!What I love:The Cut, Color, Quality!  (Give me a new car seat or stroller over a diamond anyday!)Love how easy it is to get securely fastenedSun Shade is awesome, never thought of a need for one on a full size seat but we have large windows and the sun does beat in even though they have a slight tint!Looks CoolMy daughter loves it, she does not struggle. Her only complaint has been that it doesn't have monkeys, the boys got Cleks!The fabric is comfortable and NON-TOXIC, which I loveI love that I can put it on the stroller if I should ever get the urge!Cons:The Price, although it is not much different than the Advocate it just seems like all of their stuff is high!  I should know I have ALL OF IT X 2.  Except the bassinet, I just have one of those!This is petty but I really don't like the little blue button on the seat. I tried to pull it off before I read the directions.Unexpected Bonus:I love the back cover that holds the instruction book and covers the straps!I would buy again!  Oh wait, I will when my youngest out grows her infant seat!Now if they could just add that monkey, Hmmmm.............P.S. I have posted pictures of my two year old daughter in the seat!
B0017VM2NY sure, it may be safe. but it's also a big pain in the butt.-in my 4-runner, i couldn't see anything out the rear view mirror with my rear-facing toddler car seat. NOTHING.-the only way i could rotate it was to climb into the backseat, grip both sides and pull with all my strength. SO frustrating.-there is no way i could lift my sleeping child, strapped into that thing, out of the car & onto the stroller. NO way.-there is no recline option for your sleeping child. my son weighed 22 lbs at 6 months old & required a toddler car seat. after 2 trips and seeing his poor little head in his lap, i was done.-and the obvious negative, once your child is forward facing, the infamous rotating base is obsolete.i am thrilled with my britax boulevard click safe. for $320 it's a little cheaper, reclines, looks great and is top of the class safety.orbit, i love your infant system. i was your #1 fan. but you've got a loooong way to go on the toddler system as far as i'm concerned.
B0017VM2NY I bought Orbit Baby Toddler Car Seat because I was lured by the swivel base. When my son was rear facing this was heaven sent, but forward facing is a nightmare. Without the base, this product is just an overpriced toddler car seat, also damaged the seat of the car, gave a permanent round dent on leather, it is heavy and bulky with round bottom. It is impossible to install in a short time. I had an emergency that I had to switch cars in the shop and I have never hated this monster car seat more. For months I put up with this because it was very expensive and too late to return (I did love it when I could use it with the base). However, I have suffered enough and finally give in and buy another car seat. I take the loss, because I didn't realize when I chose to buy this, that the swivel base is not supposed to be used forward facing. If I have to do it again, I would not buy this even for rear facing, and WILL NOT recommend this car seat to anyone, whether it's my friends I like or in-laws I don't like. I gave it one star because it does look good, and customer service responded in timely manner when I called to replace the broken clip.
B0017VM2NY I own the Orbit Baby Stroller set and once my little one outgrew his infant carrier, I was hesitant to get the Orbit Baby Toddler Car Seat because of a bit of sticker shock.  In the end, I am glad I bought it.  We keep a car seat in every car so we don't have to switch them around and this is hands down the best.  The AirProtect is second, but by FAR.  We also bought a bargain priced Cosco one and that one is just terrible (I got what I paid for - and will be replacing it soon enough!).This has been so convenient for me, especially when we travel.  I bring my Toddler Car Seat and my Orbit base and voila!  Car Seat and stroller in one!  The fact that it can rotate on the stroller base and seemlessly go from the car to the stroller or even into the house when my little one has fallen asleep is perfect!Please note that once you put the car seat in the front facing position, you will discontinue the use of the rotating base and will then use the brackets (which are nicely packaged and easy to use).  Despite this set back, I still love it.  Everything is cleverly designed, from the \"paparazzi cover\" and where it is stored, to the tiny velcro tabs that keep the straps for the seat open  while your baby is not inside of it.  This is a very well made car seat and I couldn't be happier.I love all my Orbit Baby products!If you're using the toddler car seat as a stroller seat whilst on vacation and you'd like some more shade/coverage (we did when we took our baby to Hawaii!), then simply purchase a $12 Ray Shade and you can attach the top straps to the strap in the back that holds the paparazzi cover and thread the side straps into the upper or lower holes along the tension line for the handles.  You'll easily double or triple your shade this way.  When I use the Ray Shade, It covers all the way to the front of the car seat.  This is an excellent \"hack\".  I don't know if anyone has ever thought about it, but I figured I'd post it here since it's posted on my blog!
B0017VM2NY My little one is 7 months and just outgrowing the infant capsule. We tried her in this the other day but she is still too short and she is comfier in the capsule. I will update it in the future but at the moment this is fantastic and they have thought of everything
B0017VM2NY I am thrilled with my Orbit Baby toddler car seat and want to put to rest some of the issues others have brought up.  Our family has all the other Obit Baby products and with this final addition to the collection, I see all the usual thoughtfulness of design and attention to detail.Our son is 14 months old, around 30\" tall and 24 lbs and absolutely loves his new seat.  We have installed it rear facing in the center seat (on the base) of our CRV.  Though the seat is very tall, it allows for plenty of growth in the future and I can still see out the rear window just fine.  Also, when installed on the base, our son gets a few extra inches of height and he loves to look out the window.I also want to point out that the rear installation on the base makes use of the anti-rebound feature of the base which is RARELY found in any car seat on the market in the US, though very common in Europe.  The base is braced against the rear seat-back and prevents the seat from tipping forward and smashing your kid into the seat back in the event of a crash.  This also protects you child's legs and makes it even safer to keep them rear facing as long as possible.  The only other way to get this kind of protection is to use a tether strap and an anchor in the floor of the car, which most cars do not have.  Britax is the only other manufacturer to address this in rear facing situations.  Kids can sit fine with their legs crossed; lots of safety experts have commented that rear facing as long as possible is the way to go.There is no point in using the base (or any base) forward facing as it is very important to use the top tether to secure the seat tightly against the car's seat-back.  I don't understand why people don't realize this when they purchase ANY seat, yet complain about the lack of forward facing/base coupling with the Orbit.We do not use this car seat on the stroller chassis on a regular basis but have this wonderful feature specifically in mind for when we are traveling, which we do frequently.  Getting through the airport was such a breeze.  Just wheel right up to the plane's doors and then carry the seat on the plane and strap it in.  I can't imagine trying to travel around a city and forgo using a car seat in taxi just because of the hassle and I'd hate using one of those car seat travel adapters where you push/pull your kid around about 5 inches off the ground, nasty!  Almost all cars/taxis these days have the LATCH system so it takes about 30 seconds to get it in and out.  This is what Orbit Baby had in mind, you obviously don't use it as your everyday stroller but as an bonus feature to the Obit list of features.Getting the straps properly adjusted was a cinch, they are on the lowest setting and I have moved the crotch strap forward one.  The gray head protection pillow also moved down to the lowest setting and fits our guy perfectly.  Again, Orbit Baby has made this process very simple.  All of the straps are neatly stored in the back side of the car seat, there is even a place for the sunshade and the manual as well as the extra installation straps for use without the base.  I have no issue what so ever with the straps twisting.  When I take my son out of the seat, we loosen the straps and then use the handy Velcro tabs to keep the straps out of the way.  When I put him back in, the straps are out of the way and just waiting to be secured, piece of cake!UPDATE: 3/30/2012I am looking to by a second toddler seat as we are now on baby number two nearing the one-yea-old stage.  I wasn't nuts about spending another $360 on a big car seat and I noticed the above reviewer had purchased a Maxi Cosi Pria 70.  Amazon had them on sale for near to the two hundred range so I purchased one and thought I'd try it out.  I can't believe the difference in quality and how crappy it was compared to the Orbit.  The Maxi Cosi Pria 70 is exactly the same as the Cosco Senerca which is a popular \"extra\" seat for under fifty bucks.  I couldn't believe that Maxi Cosi (actually Doral group) was charging an extra two hundred bucks for some fancy padding.  Come on people.  Orbit has the highest tech in impact protection with the EPP foam.  The Maxi Cosi is a plastic shell and THAT'S IT!Can't wait for Obit to adjust their line for multi-kid families!
B0017VM2NY Paying this much for a toddler seat had better be worth it, and it almost is.  My only complaint, which I saw going into this deal, is that this thing is way too heavy and physically bulky to really function as part of a travel system.  Sure you can remove it from your car and dock it to the Orbit stroller if you have it, but if you value your back, you're gonna want to securely tether this thing in a semi-permanent fashion to your backseat and never lift it again.  Not to mention, once you're using it forward-facing (meaning you can no longer dock it to and from the Orbit Base), you can't really remove it all that easily.  That's why Orbit has another option available for strolling, lighter and better for moving about.  But you can't use that in the car, and of course it costs extra.This weight problem really prevents you from utilizing this as part of the travel system, which is the main reason say, you would buy an Orbit on top of another brand if you already have the Orbit Infant System.  So they should just sell it as the best-designed and safest toddler car seat out there, because that's what it is.As far as comfort, safety, quality, materials, and workmanship, you are going to be hard-pressed to find a better seat, though.  My daughter loves this, and even sleeps comfortably in it.I do recommend it, but think twice if you're buying it for its \"portability\" and practicality in a travel system... it's none of those things.
B0017VMH5M It is a good bouncer. For a while it the only place my child would sleep in,i can only assume it must have been comfy.
B0017VMH5M This is the Boppy Bounce in Comfort Bouncer, however, the description on Amazon is for the Boppy Cradle in Comfort Bouncer. So, I didn't realise they weren't quite the same thing.I was just sent this package and had put together before I realised that the music/sound component wasn't what I wanted. Aside from the ability to bounce and the softness of this device, the reason I wanted it was the soothing sounds. However, this item only has one selector so all you get is the music. Also, I assume that the music cycles through all 5 tunes that are mentioned on the package? I didn't bother to listen as the first tune was just dire.Bottom line: If you like the idea of soothing sounds, don't buy this product. I have returned mine and indicated to Amazon the incorrect descriptor on the website.Other than this issue, the product looked a good buy for the price. The colour of the material was a bit ho hum but that wouldn't have caused me too much angst. At least it was neutral which was what I wanted.
B0017VMH5M My husband and I LOVE these, we used them more as a seat/bed rather than a bouncer.My twins were both less than 6lbs when they came home from the hospital so these seats were WAY too big for them. We folded a bunch of blankets and layed them on these so they fit a little better. My girls loved laying/sleeping beside eachother and these seats were PERFECT to do that. We could lay the girls in these seats side by side so they were snuggled together and the sides kind of cradled them and made them feel secure. Our daughters slept in their cribs at night but during the day they loved to be in these together.When they were young enough we didn't have to strap them in(but also always watched them) because the shape of the seats are deep and perfect. This was so helpful with twins, especially when watching them alone. For instance, if I was holding Zoey on my lap while Madison was in her seat, if Madison started choking(she did often due to reflux) I could quickly put Zoey in her own seat & pick up Madison. I didn't have to worry about Zoey being strapped in so getting her in her seat was fast & Madison wasn't strapped in so I was able to get her out in a flash. I can not even express how important not having to strap them in when they were newborns was but it made our lives a whole lot easier. These seats were almost like a second set of hands to us.These were also easy to take places or from room to room so we took these everywhere with us.Once my daughters were a little bigger we started putting them in their own seats and they loved watching cartoons or napping, they never did mind being put in these seats. Also, they loved being put in the more upright position when they were older and if they fell asleep I could easily put the seat back into the recline position w/out disturbing them. They never payed much attention to the toys so I never kept that attached.We had 2 other different kinds of bouncers but they were no where near as comfy as these nor would they have been able to nap or lay together in them. Especially if you have twins I would definately recommend getting these.
B0017VMH5M Very basic bouncer which was GREAT! Was nice and 'bouncy' when other baby bouncers seem stiff. It's so incredibly soft! Easy to clean/wash! The toys left something to be desired but my son actually formed an attachment to the bee! Bought this WAY cheaper elsewhere so shop around for better price! Was not disapointed with quality!
B0017VMH5M This was my old review until the baby loved it:Don't buy this!!! First, while putting this together I noticed some little broken plastic pieces in the bag upon delivery.  The pieces of plastic were so small and cheap-looking that I figured it can't be important.  While putting this part together I noticed the bar wouldn't click into place like the other bars did.  I then proceeded to put the back bar on.  I examined it and there were no Right/Left labels, so I figured it didn't matter. Well, it does!  Instead of the top play bar going middle to back, it goes middle to feet now and there is no way of unlocking it once you assemble!  I took apart over 7 screws and still couldn't unlock it!  Due to this, there is no way of getting it back into the box to return! I'm stuck with a $40 piece of crap with no toy bar for the baby!#2  Actually it works fine backwards.  The baby was born with hip dislocation and sleeping flat was painful for her with her harness.  She slept comfortably in this chair (without the toy bar) for 2 months and now still sits in it to watch Elmo at 3.5 months old.  We love it!
B0017WVRM0 The windup part is great - no batteries! - but it only plays for about 3 minutes before it's done.  Alternatively, you can just have the mobile spin with no noise.  I thought that would be good for a slight distraction while easing a little one to sleep, except it spins so fast you'd think they're on a merry-go-round!  It moves far too fast for a 0-3 month old to be able to track.
B0017WVRM0 I love it. Great as the many other baby items I purchased for the new arrival of my grandson. It matches all the other Safari themed items I have got. Great in his room, which has the theme Jungle Safari. Would recommend.
B0017WVRM0 You have to keep winding this which is a big pain for me.  Other than that my little one likes it.
B0017WVRM0 I got a great price on this and themed my sons room after this.  Found an awesome animal print sheet, my cousin made a wreath with similar animals on it and I used the green color from this and cream color for the walls.  Great product.  Works well.  My son loves looking at it when falling asleep.  Would recommend again if still available.  Has a nice way of hooking to the bed without scratching it as well.
B0017WVRM0 This is a classic mobile that matches the Nojo set perfectly. It's adorable and the music is soothing. It definitely mesmorizes my newborn son.However, it is a wind-up mobile and it doesn't play foe that long, so turning it gets annoying... I bought this mobile because it matched the set I bought but I ended up getting the Fisher Price Rainforest mobile because it has batteries and plays on it's own.
B0017WVRM0 Ended up buying another one from Tiny Love that not only was battery operated, but also lasted for 20 min, came with a remote and you can use the music piece after you have to remove the mobile portion. Hoping that I can sell this one and recoup most of the money.
B0017WVRM0 I got this for my baby so he would have something to look at while laying in his crib and trying to get to sleep.  It's really cute and plays music.  I just wish the music played for longer (it plays for only about 30 seconds).
B0017YJ1O4 helps us organize our playroom and can hold a lot of weight with the included parts. we like it so far!
B0017YJ1O4 I pored over all the animal hammocks' reviews on Amazon before deciding on this one, and I'm so glad I did! The netting is super strong and I love the high-quality elastic. This allowed me to position the hammock exactly how I wanted it, and I don't worry about my kids breaking it when they pull an animal down. The hooks and mollies supplied were simple to install. Overall a great product, especially at this price!
B0017YJ1O4 Simple installation, great sized product, serves the intended purpose. I love being able to see all my daughter's dolls and at the same time have them up and off the floor (and away from my dogs' reach, too). Classic product, it is popular for a reason.
B0017YJ1O4 I couldn't find a hammock for my son's stuffed animals anywhere locally, so I ordered this one. It arrived quickly and is exactly as advertised. It was easy to attach to the wall, with the included hardware, and it holds a ton of my son's animals. We put it low to the ground so he can reach in and grab what he wants, as he is never alone in his room (10 mo old).I am very happy with this hammock. It is exactly what I was looking for.
B0017YJ1O4 First, this comes with four hooks and anchors. One of the three positions requires six, just fyi.For me, this was difficult to do alone and one of my walls did not allow me to drill into it and hang this, so I had to improvise and nail the hammock into the wall. Since my daughter is a newborn and this is away from her crib, this is okay. I was also really disappointed this arrived dirty. One section of it looks like it was stomped on and drug through the mud. Gross. I haven't washed it to see if it would come out. I just wanted all my daughters endless amounts of stuffed animals out of her crib so she could sleep in it.It's a good price, but you'll certainly need help hanging this and hope that your walls allow you to drill into them.
B0017YJ1O4 Does hold a lot of stuffed animals, I don't know if it's just the corner I have my hammock in but I feel like a lot of the space is wasted because it would push itself too far out of the wall. Again, might just be the way I have the room set up and that specific corner. I think the price and quality is fair. I'd order again if I had the need.
B0017YJ1O4 My daughters stuffed animal collection was getting severely out of control and this has really helped. Since she now shares a room with her baby sister this also helped keep some of her precious babies away from her sisters slobbery fingers. Works perfectly. Stretches really far. No complaints
B00185RM02 My daughter likes this little toy.  It's such a simple, cute little toy.  She likes to shake it and chew on it's ears.  Very cute.
B00185RM02 Seems like a hit, better-than-average baby toy.  Makes noise, bounces, easy to put in my son's mouth, adds up to a hit for my 7 month old.
B00185RM02 While my daughter was a bit slow to enjoy the rattle aspect of this toy, she loved to look at the sunny smiley face and chew every bit of it. This was WONDERFUL for us --an all-time favorite toy -- from about 5 months to 8 months. I now give them as gifts to everyone having a baby.
B00185RM02 So I guess I am the toy lover. hahaha. Baby plays with it, but it gets lost a lot and I have no idea why.this is the second one I have lost, so perhaps it is being taken by visiting babies. Hmmmm
B00185RM02 My 6 month old granddaughter is at the stage that she squirms around, looking for things to grab, while I'm changing her diapers.  I hand her this rattle during changing time, and she focuses on it and doesn't squirm around.  She likes to chew on the fabric flower petals.  It is one of her favorite rattles, and it surely makes diaper changes easier on Grandma.
B00185RM02 Admittedly there are a LOT of really good rattles, but our son discovered this one at a mommy and me class, and now several months later it is still one of his favorites.  The teether is a little tough to get at but he enjoys trying to put it in his mouth, and the rattle is nice and loud and easy to grasp. We got this for him around 3 months and he is now 6 months and still loves to shake this.  Thumbs up!Also - the Jumpy version of this sold on Amazon was also a huge hit in the mommy and me. I have exhausted our toy budget for the moment and now he is probably moving on to other bigger boy toys, but if you are looking for a gift for a 2-3 month old the Jumpy is one I would definitely recommend.
B00185RM02 Purchased as a small simple toy for my 5 month old.  He rearlly enjoys it.  I will push down on the top and it bounces back up and he thought that was fun.  It is also small enough for his hands.  Seems a lot of toys are really large and bulbous, maybe with the thinking the larger, the easier it is to grab but he prefers the smaller things, like the &#34;legs&#34; of this toy - he can wrap his little hands around it and pick it up.  He still plays with it at 6 months.  It has a rattle also which I didn't realize and he likes rattles.  He also enjoys the face - he seems to love black/white eyes nose mouth on a lot of his little toys.
B00185RM02 This is perfect for tummy time and for encouraging crawling later on! Push down on the head and the toy pops up just a little and rattles! And when they get a hold of it they love to chew the crinkly ears! This is the third I have purchased for grandchildren and they all love it!
B00185RM02 It was my daughter's first Valentine's Day this year, so I wanted to get her something to celebrate. I thought of getting a single rose, but she won't have any use for it. So I searched for \"toy flower\" and \"baby flower\" on Amazon, and had to pass up listings of clothing before I found this.Perfect.It wasn't red and it had that large bulb at the bottom for the rattle, but it was close enough. So I ordered it. My daughter loves it. She's about 6 months right now, so she constantly puts the flower rattle in her mouth. It's great, though, because the petal part is flat and small enough that it fits in her little mouth, and the texture allows her to bite down toothlessly on it hard without bother. It's actually got two layers of petal: one where it's fabric and the paper material inside makes a crinkling sound for her stimulation, and then the firmer portion that's more like a teether.The stem is wide, but not too wide to prevent her from grabbing it with one hand.She likes the sound of the rattle, though I found it kind of annoying. It's a little more high pitched than other rattles we have, but I'll tolerate it if she likes it, which it seems she does. She almost always grabs it when I put it near her.
B00185RM02 I bought this for my daughter when she was an infant and she got far more use out of it than I ever anticipated. Not only was it a great rattle for when she was new and learning to grasp things, but it was a good teether, too (the orange petal part is soft plastic, while the pink petals are crinkly fabric). This was one of her favorite toys when she was an infant, and often other babies would gravitate towards it/play with it when they visited our house. When my daughter got older, it made a great musical instrument. She's nearly 2 now and will still play with it when she comes across it in her toy box. This flower is very colorful and attractive, and durable, too: after years of being shaken, dropped and chewed on, it still looks just as good as it did when I bought it. I liked this product so much I've even given it as a gift to several of my friends for their babies. I certainly recommend this product.
B00185RM02 I've always loved sunflowers which was my main reason for getting it, plus at the time it was on sale for $1 and some change! More importantly, I feel Baby will really enjoy this.  The rattle sound is quite nice and not irritating at all.  Perfect size for little one's hands. I didn't give it 5 stars, just because for some reason it wasn't as cute to me in person as it was online; may be the way the photo is angled, but it's still cute and def worth the price Amazon gave!
B00186YSMQ I love this car seat! It looks and feels sturdier than any other car seat I've seen. I love the extra protection around my baby's head. Love the cushion around the straps. Love the newborn cushion; my baby sat up very well in this seat from day one leaving the hospital (we did use a rolled blanket around his head for the first few weeks, but I think all newborns need extra head support in any car seat). Love that the harness can be adjusted without rethreading. Love that the handle can be pointed down to keep the car seat from rocking when on a hard surface, if needed. The stylish colors are a great plus too (we have tropical)! Highly recommend!ETA: It's March 2014 and I'm coming back to edit my review now that we have used this seat with baby #2 for 4 months. We used it with baby #1 until he was 11 months old (too tall). The fabric held up beautifully and looked like new for baby #2 (granted #1 didn't spit up in it EVER, and wasn't a drooler...unlike kiddo #2. ahem.). The newborn cushion is nice for catching the spit-up that seems to constantly pour forth from my sweet, adorable daughter, and it is easy to remove and wash (and holds up well in the washer and dryer). The buttons on the handles that you have to push in are a bit \"sticky\" now and usually have to be pushed several times before you find that \"sweet spot\" so that they will both go in and you can change the handle position. This wasn't a problem the last time we used it, and I'm not sure why 3 years of storage in our climate-controlled closet would have caused it. Still love the seat, but the finicky buttons this time around are extremely annoying.
B000QD7MZ2 I have three different feeders in my backyard and this seems to be the favorite. Sadly, my hummingbirds fight so, at most, I'll get two hummingbirds carefully spaced. Even so, they don't want to go to one of the other feeders but rather fight over this one.They don't share very well, so it's really kind of big since I change the solution regularly.The one thing that really brings this down to three stars for me is that the diameter of the lip of the top that fits into the base is too big. First, the top needs to be inserted, it goes down about a half-inch, and then it is turned and locked into place. I was having a very difficult (and messy) time getting the top to fit. I finally had to shave off some of the rim around the base with a razor. Happy to say that I still have ten fingers.It is easy to clean and I don't have a problem with the vacuum effect that I've had with other feeders.So, it's a five for the hummingbirds and a three for me -- average is four.06/22/2014: I changed my review to a three today. Even though I've tried to shave away some of the plastic on the base, it's still a tight squeeze. Today while trying to maneuver the container onto the base, the whole thing slipped, spewing sugar water all over my kitchen. Now I should also add, \"the ants give it a five.\"
B000QD7MZ2 When in a hour of hanging this feeder the hummers found it! It was very easy to put together. It's super easy to refill and to clean. I love the perches under each flower. The birds seem to enjoy them as well. They come and rest on them often. We love watching these amazing creatures and this feeder helps us to do so. Great product!
B000QD7MZ2 I bought this for my parents who live on a farm where they literally get swarms of hummingbirds.  My father has to refill the nectar every day because there are so many birds lighting on his little feeder.  With this new 48 ounce feeder, now he only has to refill the nectar every two or three days.  I would not recommend this feeder if you only have a few visitors because the nectar will spoil and ferment before they can consume it all and this is very unhealthy for the birds.
B000QD7MZ2 First let me say we go through A LOT of hummingbird solution. We drain five 48 ounce feeders a day at our house from Mid March through mid July. We also have two pairs that over-winter - so I always have at least one feeder up.I purchased my first Grand Master feeder from Amazon and,when I went to buy more last week I noticed that Amazon is not selling them because of some complaints - or whatever the verbiage was - so I ordered three more from another online source.I have been thrilled with these feeders. They are easier to fill, much easier to clean (you can get your whole hand in the opening) and I no longer need a bottle brush to clean them, plus I am not having to fill quite as frantically as I was because of the larger size. I was so puzzled by the fact that Amazon was not selling them that I started to think of what people might possibly have to say that wasn't good, and this is what I came up with:Most of us, if we use a larger sized hummingbird feeder, are accustomed to using the 32 ounce model that is a bottle with a narrow opening through which you fill the feeder. I used to use a funnel to do so. The bottle sets in the base. When carried outside in the upright position here is always a little leakage as you carry them out to the feeding station but that seems to happen with all of the hummer feeders that I have ever tried. With the 48 ounce feeder, the bottom is much wider; hence no need for a funnel and the ability to make cleaning easier. When you set the bottle back on the base, because of the larger opening there is more leakage. That's the only thing that I can think people might complain about.I have easily solved this issue  ( and used to to do the same thing with the 32 ounce models) by keeping the bottle upside down (standing on the top) after they are filled and replacing the bottom of the feeder (which I always cleaned at the same time as I refilled)  on the top and walking them outside in an upside down manner. Problem solved.For me, with the amount of food I go through, this feeder is such an improvement that I would never complain or return to the 32 ounce feeder, funnel and bottle brush ever again. I love this feeder, and with a bit of common sense it is no more 'drippy' than the smaller sized bottles.
B000QD7MZ2 This is ideal feeder. Easy to fill and easy to hang up. That is what I liked, the easy of filling and hanging. The ease allows me to let my daughter to help me. She really enjoys feeding and watching the humming birds.
B000QD7MZ2 We love hummingbirds and always put out a feeder or two every year despite the fact that in our x-burban wooded area we don't get that many.  (We still try ;)The feeders I currently have on hand are all PERKY-PET.  I know there are other varieties out there but Perky-pet provides different styles, all at affordable prices.  Right now I have this one (which is the 220), thePerky-Pet 209B Our Best Glass Hummingbird Feeder, and our old standby, thePerky-Pet Pinch-Waist Glass Hummingbird FeederOut of those three, this is the one I would have rated the lowest, except I have to say that the Hummingbirds really like it.  What I worried about was the base. Since it doesn't come apart I'm going to have to clean it with Q-tips.  This would be a real negative, except for the fact that their Hummers like this feeder.  It has convenient little perches which are set perfectly for feeding.  The birds sit up high enough so that all they need to do is bend over a bit and drink from the plastic flowers.THE GOOD--I prefer glass, but sometimes if children are involved, shatter-proof plastic is better.--Nice handle.--Attractive design.--Hummingbirds love it. We are just getting our first Hummers as I write this and I have to say that they like sitting on the little perches and drinking.THE BAD--Looks like it's going to be difficult to clean.OTHER OBSERVATIONS--I read all the reviews about leaking. Mine didn't leak. I don't know if Perky-Pet improved the design, but we shook the container, and so far, no leaks.--Unlike the other models I mentioned this one doesn't have threaded glass. Instead it has a 'bayonet' connection.--This thing is HUGE. Unless you live in a locale where you get tons of hummer traffic, I wouldn't suggest you fill this feeder with more than a cup of hummer-chow. The reason is that once it starts getting warm the sugars can get all gross and you should change them out frequently.--Since this feeder is plastic, it might make a good choice if you are going to be letting younger children work with it.SUGGESTIONS--It's best if you don't use the red food. Making your own is super easy, nothing more than mixing 1/4 cup sugar with 1 cup of distilled water. Red dye not needed.--Ants! We hang our feeders off the deck from iron hangers. We keep ants away with vaseline. I have the kids coat the the riser on the road with a heavy slather of vaseline and the ants stay away. Doesn't harm ants or other wildlife.
B000QD7MZ2 I didn't realize when ordering this hummingbird feeder that the container itself was plastic. We have other Perky Pet hummingbird feeders but he jars are made of glass. The plastic is more difficult to lock into place with the plastic bottom so that it won't leak. It's a nice big feeder, holding 48 ounces of feeding solution. It is surprising how fast tiny hummingbirds go through the food but since it needs to be cleaned every two or three days in order for mold not to grow, we will probably fill it only halfway unless we get more Hummers.The feeder came unassembled, but it was pretty easy to snap the yellow flowers to the openings and screw the little perches to the bottom. The container is easy to clean but the bottom part requires a brush since it's difficult to remove the yellow flower covers and they will probably not last if we have to take them on and off all the time. It's a little bit difficult to secure the container to the bottom, having to twist it into the slots and secure it so that it doesn't leak. I am hoping it will last long-term. We use this type of ant barrier or \"ant moat\" that hangs between the hook and the feeder.Songbird Essentials SE620 Nectar Protector Bird Accessory. It works very well and keeps the feeder from being overrun with ants.
B000QD7MZ2 There isn't a whole lot to say about this, it's a hummingbird feeder. The feeding ports and perches all come in separate bags and you just snap them on. There aren't any instructions or anything but it's easy enough to figure out if you just look at the picture on the box to see what it should look like. The only real downside to this feeder is that it is so big that it's really impractical unless you've got tons of hummingbirds in your yard. When you consider that nectar is supposed to be switched out at least once a week if not more often, 48 ounces is an enormous amount to keep switching out. I would suggest going for something smaller unless you really think you're going to make it through this much nectar before it spoils.
B000QD7MZ2 I like the large capacity, and the hummers liked it right away. I guess I've gotten spoiled, but I miss a bee guard and ant moat. I made my own ant moat. A hanging wire would be nice. But I really appreciate the wide filler. Assembly was a little tough with my arthritic thumbs, but I got it done. The most important thing is that my tiny hummingbirds like it.
B000QD7MZ2 I have used a lot of Perky-Pet feeders over the past 20+ years. This one definitely has more capacity than any other commercially available hummingbird feeder, which means trips to remove, clean and refill the feeder are less frequent. The feeder does not come fully assembled and it's a bit of a struggle to snap in those yellow floral discs... and because of the opening there is big (a huge invite for wasps, etc.) without the yellow disc, it's not an optional add-on - you've got to snap that sucker in there... it just makes it more complex to take apart to clean. I make my own feeder mixture of 5:1 water to sugar ratio as the birds do not need red dye - the red on the feeder is enough to attract them. I prep the mixture in the kitchen after I clean my feeders, then fill the feeder - carrying it upside down until I get in the yard so there is minimal spillage. Even though this one was properly assembled, there was some spilling when I righted it - more than I'm used to in a feeder. The central reservoir is plastic - likely because glass would make it too heavy - but I am not impressed with the quality of the plastic grooves you use to turn/lock this into place. Taking it apart and re-assembling it just once put little clear and red plastic shavings everywhere - including in the nectar reservoir. I do not see this lasting through an abundant number of refills - because those plastic tabs get shaved each time you screw and unscrew the bottom from the reservoir - eventually, it simply will not have the friction to stay together when too much material is lost. I know they're calling this &#34;The Grand Master&#34; because of the capacity - but I'd much rather see a higher-quality one - glass reservoir with a metal bottom and baked enamel paint instead of this weak plastic that quickly wears. I have some high quality feeders I paid a lot of money for - because they are made out of such better materials and frankly -they look better. Perky-Pet did great on the capacity - I just wish they'd done better on the materials end.
B000QD7MZ2 If you live in an area where you need a large capacity feeder to keep your hummingbirds happy, it's hard to imagine how this feeder would not suit your needs. That said, I did see comments on a review where the person said they have several and are still refilling daily! This feeder was made for those situations, but sadly, those of us that do not have swarms of hummers in their yards will do more dumping of unused juice.Assuming that your situation is the former, and you need 1.5 quarts of juice to keep your hummers happy, you'll find that the plastic cylinder is very easy to clean. It has a wide mouth that makes thorough cleaning a snap. However, the base is nearly impossible to clean properly, as the liquid fills the base, with the recessed areas very hard to reach and clean effectively. If you have any liquid in the cylinder when it comes time to clean, have a place to drain quite a bit of liquid out of the base when you tip it over or take it apart in the sink.In the four weeks that I tested this feeder, I did find that the ruby throated hummingbirds we have here did use it without any issues. Our birds are very territorial, so we never get more than one at a feeder at a time. I was really hoping that the number of ports on this feeder, and the fact that we had six feeders spread around the yard at one time would encourage more birds to be visible at once, but that didn't happen.Just recently, I have found that getting the cylinder to fit into the base is more difficult; almost as if it is going slightly out of round or something. It's not a big deal, as it just takes some patience to put the pieces together.Filling this with 48 ounces of sugar water means that it's going to have some weight, so a sturdy hanger is a necessity. Fortunately, the metal hanger at the top of the cylinder is up to the task. I never had a concern about it breaking and falling, but the shallow clearance requires a proper hook so you don't have to tilt the feeder. An added plus is that the red cap with the hanger screws off the cylinder, which has a flat top, so you can fill the inverted cylinder while it stands on a counter and then screw the top on to hang it. Having these separate parts makes replacements possible as well so heavy users should have some options in that regard.Durability doesn't seem to be a problem, as it was dropped onto a tile floor from a height of about three feet, and all that happened was that one of the feeder port flowers popped out. It snapped back in without any trouble, and nothing else cracked or broke as a result of the bouncing it took.Overall, this is too much feeder for many situations. But for those that need the capacity, this is one of the few I've seen that will hold this much juice. While the base is a little unwieldy when it comes to cleaning, I'm not sure there's a better way to build it and still serve six ports with this much juice. If it weren't for the hard-to-clean crevices in the base, I'd give it a solid four stars.
B000QD7MZ2 The best thing about this feeder is its huge 48 ounce capacity. If you're looking for something you can fill up and then forget about for a long time, this may be it. Otherwise, it's all plastic and looks cheap. I'd invest in a smaller glass/metal feeder instead.
B000QD7MZ2 I've had a few of the Perky Pet feeders over the years, a few of the plastic, a few of the glass - and they all have their pro's and con's.  Aesthetically, I still prefer thePerky-Pet 8120-2 Green Antique Bottle Hummingbird Feederseries, but the birds in my area don't seem too attracted to the color (although Perky Pet does offer blue and red versions which might do a better job). The glass bottles just seem to have a little bit of visual impact that allow it to act sort of as a decoration and not just a feeder. These giant 48oz feeders don't try and hide their function - they very boldly proclaim that they are hummingbird feeders.The feeder doesn't really include any useful assembly instructions, but that's not too big a deal as putting it together is pretty elementary. The large reservoir is easy to clean, but you do need a brush (or a really small hand) to get to the very bottom. The perches are very finicky and feel delicate - I'm not really sure how long they'll last. The plastic is also a big question mark. I live in sun country in the middle of Texas, and the harsh sun likes to take out its aggression on plastic. Previous plastic feeders have often cracked or discolored within just a couple of seasons.Another thing to keep in mind, although the large size is nice, unless you're feeding a giant swarm of birds, the nectar will probably \"go bad\" before the birds get to drink it all. In my hot climate, the sugar water molds up within a couple of days or less.All-in-all, I think my next feeder will probably be another glass + metal, but the brilliant red coloration and significant nectar size do make this particular feeder stand out. As long as the plastic parts make an attempt at lasting more than a single season, I'll be pretty ha
B000QD7MZ2 I was skeptical because there are too many parts and openings.  The more  openings and parts the more chance for failure.The &#34;flowers&#34;  have to be pushed into holes and then the yellow centers inserted.  The hole you push the flower into is failrly big and  over time the plastic becomes brittle and leakage begins. My hummers seem to like the smaller feeders  ( which are made by Perky Pet)  I think a little more &#34;design tweaking&#34;  is needed. The smaller feeders are simpler but work better.
B000QD7MZ2 This is a huge capacity plastic feeder that does the job well and attracts hummingbirds quickly.  Where we are, we get mostly Broad-tail hummingbirds.  They tend to feed one at a time; if a second one shows up, they chase each other around until one leaves (for the time being).  The six feeding flowers may help hummingbirds find the food, but aren't used simultaneously by our birds.It is well made of sturdy plastic; the jar is especially thick clear plastic.  The jar is sealed at the top - to refill, unscrew the top and bottom, flip it over, clean, and pour in the solution.  Ours leaked the first day until we realized we needed to turn the flowers so the clips would hold them tighter - presto, no more leaks!  The perches can be removed if desired, but it is really cool to see hummingbirds perched - which they do about 1/3 the time when feeding.For the \"nectar,\" we dissolve 1/2 cup white sugar in 2 cups plain boiling water; be careful about adding anything else as it could be harmful to the hummingbirds.  This fills it about 1/3 way, which lasts several days even with lots of bird activity.  I don't want to let it go more than a few days between refills to ensure the solution doesn't spoil.  So really, something with less capacity would work just fine.  It doesn't leak (except for spillage when the wind blows it around), and the hummingbirds noticed it and began feeding within a few hours of putting it up.  The base has plenty of color to attract birds, so no need for red solution.Taking down the feeder for cleaning and refilling would be easier with a small clip.  We tied ours to a string and have to either work the top out of the wire hanger, or unscrew it and leave the top hanging, making it harder to reattach when full.  A clip would make this much easier.  Also be sure to let the solution cool completely before filling, and rinse off the perches when cleaning and refilling to encourage perching.We hung ours a few feet outside a picture window, and the hummingbirds don't seem to mind at all when we are nearby.  Perhaps they have gotten used to humans.  We can stand quietly just under the hanging feeder and they come in to feed without seeming to notice us.
B000QD7MZ2 We got this setup and hung up in the yard and are now just waiting to see some humming birds.  It took a bit to get warmer in New England this year so hopefully soon.
B000QTMT7W I am relatively new to wood splitting. I have the great Fiskars 36\" splitter, but it couldn't get through a few knotty pieces I have. I hear wedges are good for this, so I got this one.My observations is that it doesn't do great for knotty pieces. It gets in so far, and you give it a good whack, and it bounces out. Looking at the wedge, it doesn't have a gradual grade/increase in angle; about a quarter way up, it broadens really quickly (as you can see). This is, I think, why I was seeing the behavior I was--not enough force (even with a 10lb sledge) to drive it in at that angle for these.I have a theory (and that's all it is for now ;) ), that if I get a more traditional wedge, that will work better for knotty pieces.  This wedge is probably better as an alternative to using a maul/splitter for straight pieces; people say it can split four ways in one go. I will try it for that.  But if you are looking to deal with knotty pieces, I think a standard wedge will probably be better.Again, I'm not very experienced, so take it for what it is worth.UPDATE 29 Dec 2012: I since bought a regular wedge, and I am none too impressed with it. In fact, this one seems better in getting bite so you can really drive it in.  Maybe I am just missing some part of the technique, but the problem is you need to hit it hard enough to get it to bite into the wood, then when you really lay into it for the split, it always bounces out. Seems like it should work better--like driving my splitter into it works great; I just don't want to ruin my splitter.  Will keep looking for the perfect wedge. :)
B000QTMT7W Colin's Wood Splitting Wedge, Diamond Shape, 4 Lbs. Is very good except the point bent a little which keeps me from giving five stars.
B000QTMT7W This wedge ssplits through the toughest wood like a champ! It must be because of the extra angles it attacks the wood with, but it makes splitting EASY!
B000QTMT7W During the winter (and even this Spring) we occassionally have a fire in the fireplace. I have some huge logs (some 2 feet or more in diameter) from a tree we had cut down two years ago. This really made it easy to split them. Before I was using a flat wedge but this diamond shape is fantastic!
B000QTMT7W Having had a large oak taken down and left with a large pile of 17 - 20\" pieces to chop, I figured a new splitting wedge would make life easier. My old wedge is of similar shape and design but with a blunter tip. For me the new wedge works no better than the old one. Not to say it doesn't work, but that I didn't need to buy a new one.This new wedge is more prone to pop out of the log than the older one and takes quite a bit of effort to drive into the wood with my maul. On one log section, I eventually gave up and attacked the piece with my new Fiskars X27 axe by slicing around the perimeter. As the diameter of the log shrunk, I was able to finally drive in the wedge and crack the remainder of the wood section in half.I have found that putting the wedge in the center of a log section, even one with a crack, doesn't work as well as off-centering the wedge. On less challenging sections of wood, I was able to drive the splitter much more easily and often separate the wood into three pieces.And so this wedge  works fairly well within limits; it's just not the heroic, wonder tool I was hoping for.UPDATE - After more use and experimentation I've found that my much older Oregon splitter is easier to drive, doesn't fly out at me, and works faster. This new splitter has quickly been relegated to reserve status.
B000QTMT7W I have not had a chance to use this product yet. I bought a big Fiskars wood splitting axe and the axe works so well I have not needed a wedge. This wedge seemed well priced and it arrived quickly. Looks good in my shed. If someone steals my Fiskars I might need this wedge in the future.
B000R0WXI0 I always have weeds on my sandy beach which I pick daily, but want a product to kill them for as long as possible.  This product can take 4 - 7 days to start working.  The bottle says that it will prevent weeds from coming back for up to four months,  my experience has been that it lasts about 6 weeks before I have to start pulling weeds again.  A friend told me to try a brush killer, I am going to give that a try.
B000R0WXI0 We live out in the country where weeds and thorny vines really flourish, so I still use either the Roundup Super Concentrate (purple top) or the Tough Brush Killer (yellow top) for much of our more stubborn vegetation such as blackberry vines, multifloral rose, poison ivy, and saplings.  It just seems to do a better job of getting rid of the difficult stuff.But for sidewalks, flagstone patios and walkways, and driveways, this Roundup Extended Control can't be beat.  When I use the purple or yellow topped Roundup on these areas, I end up having to respray every 3-5 weeks to combat all of the new weeds.  With the Extended Control, I can usually go 2-3 months before spraying again.  The bottle claims that it lasts up to 4 months, but in my experience, it generally wears off before then.  Still, it makes a big difference.  Instead of the 5-6 times that I would normally need to spray these areas during a growing season, I can usually get by with only spraying a couple times a year.Roundup products do take considerably longer to start producing noticeable die-back of weeds.  Many weed killers, such asSpectracide Weed And Grass Killer, wilt the weeds within an hour and leave noticeably dead weed \"leaves\" within 24 hours but have little luck in killing the root.  With the Roundup, I rarely notice any effect at all on the weeds until at least a few days later.  Even then, it's sometimes up to 2 weeks or more before they are fully dead.But, there is a reason for this.  Spectracide uses a an active ingredient called \"diquat\" which kills only the part of the plant that the spray physically touches...in effect, just drying it out so that the leaves and stem die quickly.  Therefore, it doesn't tend to kill the roots and so the weed continues to put forth new growth from the ground.Roundup, on the other hand, uses an active ingredient called \"phosphoenolpyruvate\" which works to destroy the entire \"metabolism\" of a weed and kills the entire plant...including the roots.  For these reasons, I much prefer the Roundup products.  Even though the results are not immediately noticeable, the longer term outcome is much better.Like with the other Roundup products, I mix it up with water in a pump pressure sprayer.  It is supposed to be safe from rain wash-off in 30 minutes.NOTE:  While I use Roundup as my primary weed killer throughout the growing season, I do find it beneficial to keep a container ofSpectracide Weed And Grass Killeron hand.  In late autumn, Roundup isn't usually as effective since it works on the weeds' metabolism...and the weeds are nearly dormant in cooler weather.  In this instance, the \"dry up\" process of the Spectracide works the best in my opinion.
B000R0WXI0 Used this to kill weeds and grass which were growing between the stones on my patio. In two days, they had turned yellow. It is &#34;extended control&#34; killer- will update if it has to be re-sprayed. So far, am well pleased with the product, and can recommend.
B000R0WXI0 Some here say there's better products out there, and there may be, but this one works pretty darn well for me.  It kills everything I need it to.  I just mix it in a pump sprayer and go!
B000R0WXI0 I've been using another well-known product for years but desired to try this one to see if it was any better. Cost wise it was more economical but did not do everything I would have liked. It works very well on grass and weeds (as long as it is not in a wetland area) but does nothing to small saplings or tough plants like blackberries. I suggest adding a small amount of dish-washing liquid to your sprayer because it helps the liquid to stay on the leaves instead of beading off.
B000R0WXI0 I gave up buying anything else. I have a pervasive weed and Bermuda grass problem twice every year, southwest desert area.  Other sprays have to be reapplied too often and have actually killed shrubs and harmed trees.  Not this one! It lasts through to the next spraying time! Do it once and forget bout it!  It is very important to apply it in the sun or warmer part of day, but too much sun or heat (in excess of 110 degrees) seem to counteract the effect.  Every year I seem to have less to spray, too!  So maybe in a few years.........
B000RNENU8 Miracle-Gro 1001501 All Purpose Liquid Plant Food Jug, 32-Ounce.  I better like it as I ordered 3 of these.  Have put some on a few plants but have not seen and change yet.
B000RNENU8 Mixed this with some water, and watered my girlfriends plant that keeps lilting in the summer heat.  Boing!  Now, it only needs to be watered once every 4 days to prevent lilting instead of twice a day.  Plus, the leaves are more vibrant and it's reflowering.  Good stuff!
B000RNENU8 I used to use fish emulsion on my garden. I got that tip from working at a garden center when I was in college. People used to buy the stuff like crazy and my mother became a fish emulsion lover because the stuff worked.Fish emulsion is stinky and messy. The stuff is so bad that it can induce vomiting. However, that was then and Miracle-Gro is now.This product works like a charm, is every big as effective a fish emulsion, but without the negatives.Follow the directions as stated on the label, water, and then bask in the compliments. It is just that easy. I prefer the liquid Miracle-Gro because it disperses quickly and is easy to use. There is no mess or unpleasant odor. It works quickly and within the matter of 1 to 2 weeks the results are very noticeable. This is the best plant food ever.
B000RNENU8 I've tried several different plant foods over a period of four decades with my vegetable garden. From everything I can tell, Miracle-Gro is the best in boosting the growth of one's plants. Other brands I've tried have produced less consistently good results. I generally add at the time of planting and follow the directions on the bottle. I would definitely recommend this product for any vegetable or flower garden.
B000RNENU8 Just to state the obvious, perhaps, you are paying for convenience here by getting it in liquid form. If you don't mind digging into the powder bag and getting your fingers a little blue (always happens with me), the granular Miracle-Gro costs about 1/3rd as much for an equal amount of NPK. However, it works great, just like granular Miracle Gro, although I would note that both forms are very short duration (7-14 days), so you might wish to consider a time release product if you have a large yard or garden.
B000RNENU8 I've used this product for years and it works great on all plants and flowers. I highly recommend for anyone.
B000RUDBMC It takes time to install and figure out the settings, I am not sure about the long term use, and I will post an update as soon as I notice the results.
B000RUDBMC Love this product! Within 4 days, my yard was poop free. Easy to set up. Seems to work great!
B000RUDBMC You'd think that an animal that relies on its hearing to find its prey would dislike this repeller. But our skunk blithely ignores the thing, goes about his/her business as usual, digging up our lawn in search of grubs. The only time I saw the skunk react, was when I set up the repeller on its usual path into the garden. Unless you have a yard with only one or a few access routes that you can set up one of these each, it's a pretty useless device, IMO. It certainly won't cover thousands of feet as advertised. The skunk simply ignores it!
B000RUDBMC I was hopeful that it would keep the Racoons away from my sweet corn patch. However one of the Racoons leaned up against it while the rest of the family had a feast on my corn. Ya gotta get up pretty early to match wits with a Raccoon. Those critters are smart. They know how to get over an electric fence by the jump and climb method. Playing a Radio constantly to scare them away does not work, they dance to the music and ignore the commercials. I am going to try a laser show next, followed by a motion detector water cannon.  I will let you know if any of this works. It isn't that I love corn, it is the challenge of out witting a Racoonn!
B000RUDBMC I live in the only township in CT that specifically prohibits any harm to the deer. Not surprisingly, they run amok in the neighborhood, destroying prized flowers and carefully grown vegetables with impunity.I have experimented on many remedies over the years. The spay-on repellent washed away too easily and smelled terrible to human too. Last year, I tried Enviro Pro Deer Scram, which lasted longer but was too expensive. I gives this ultrasound noise maker a try this year. It makes a high-pitch screech that is audible to human and therefore quite annoying in the evening, although the family dog does not appear to be too bothered by it. I add aGE 15153 Heavy Duty 24-Hour Mechanical Timerto turn it on from 11pm to 7am because most deer feed in our neighborhood at dawn. So far, our Casablanca Lilly remains unmolested. We will see if it survives the season.
B000RULG8I It is exactly as desribed but my ignorance ofmaterial used  made me have hier expextation. The door is a little flimsy and I use care when using it since I want it to last and not break too soon.
B000RULG8I Mounts easily to the wall. Very sturdy. Well made will last a long time. The hose fits great and it does have a bit of a storage space for other nozzles and things.
B000RULG8I Well built and easy to install. Love the little tuck away compartment with shelf so that you can store your attachments. You really can't ask for much more than that from something so simple. We have two of them and they've held up for a year so far with no signs of wear.
B000RULG8I I liked the fact that it will hold 150' of hose. I recently bought a 120' hose at a warehouse club. My old hose hanger broke within minutes.This hose hanger does the trick. UV protected plastic and a nifty mini-cabinet to store nozzles and the neighbors cat! For those \"up north\" the hanger can be taken down very easily. The hanger holes are key slotted so you can take it in.The plastic is UV protected and nice neutral brownish-beighish color. Remember plastic doesn't rust! Excellent product at this price point.
B000RULG8I Made with durable material (i.e. looks like it will last many years)We have a wide diameter hose that is 100 ft long and the hose fits nicely in this hanger.The storage cabinet offers a great space for small sprayer and provides an attractive look on the front of the house.
B000RUM0R4 We installed the Ultomato Tomato Plant Cage around existing growing plants.  The pictorial instructions were easy to follow.  Spacing and snapping in the clips to the three (03) stakes was a \"snap\".  Since the vine tomato plant was in full growth, we removed the existing single bamboo stakes and ties and pushed the three cage stakes into the soil prior to snapping the arms in place.  What an improvement over the flimsy stakes we originally used.  The unit comes with nine (09) adjustable support clips attached to the steel core stakes with heavy plastic coating. The unit can be used again and again - a quality cage at a reasonable cost. Recommended.The box contains:*Three 5' heavy-duty Sturdy Stakes*Nine fully-adjustable support clips and instructions.
B000RUM0R4 This is a handy cage, lightweight and easy to set up and move around.  In my case, though, I think it will be better suited to being a pepper support than a tomato support.  I grow indeterminate tomatoes inEarthBoxes, and they get very tall and very bushy.  This cage worked well while they were smaller, but before long it did not support their weight or height well.  I had to lash it to the deck railing.  There also weren't enough cross braces to tie all of the bushy branches to the cage.  However, the EarthBox also does a phenomenal job with peppers, and I think it will work well with those.
B000RUM0R4 For those gardeners who like to plant vine veggies this is perfect.  I like to grow grape tomatoes and they like to grow upwards to 8 feet high.  In order to keep a grape tomato plant growing upward instead of spreading outwards towards the ground is to tie it as it grows to a trellis or pole.  Doing this enables the plant to flower and make grape tomatoes spaced out and away from pests on the ground.  With the Gardeners Blue Ribbon TMC60 Ultomato Tomato Plant Cage you have three separate planes for the grape tomato to grow, which provides more air to the vine and space for tomatoes to grow.  My plants are just starters at this point but I have grown grape tomatoes for years.  I found in the past fastening the vine on a 2 dimensional plane was cumbersome and unnatural for the plant.  I'm looking forward to now having a 3 dimensional cage to allow the plant to stretch out.I plan on updating this post with possibly a video in a few months.  Happy gardening!
B000RUM0R4 My tomatoes were about 2' tall when I decided to cage them. I have been using stakes and ties in the past, but a gardening friend recommended that I cage instead. I received my cage via the Amazon Vine program, so it was risk free. I liked it enough that I purchased 3 additional ones for my other plants.Since my plants were already in the ground, I had to assemble the cage around the plants, which worked fine. The packaging on the product, however, was a little intense...there is a lot of plastic to unwrap and many twist ties. It seemed quite excessive. My plants are in deep planters as I'm in the process of reworking my garden space, so I wasn't able to put the ends in as far as they recommend. This makes the cage a good height. I am uncertain if it would be quite tall enough had I been able to insert the stakes as far as they suggested, though. The product material seems very good and I expect to be able to reuse them for at least 5 years.It loses one star for needing more horizontal support clips to be included in the package (I ended up using the twist ties).Caution to anyone who might be interested in ordering as a present: it came shipped box free, so it was clearly evident what it was.
B000RUM0R4 We've used the small round tomato cages that cost a couple of bucks for a few years now.  This cage is a huge improvement!  First of all it's significantly taller, our soil is muddy so I don't see our plants overgrowing this cage.  It is also sturdier than the round cages we've used.  I like the adjustability of it.  Our plants haven't come up yet for this season, but I have high hopes for this quality cage.
B000RUM0R4 I ordered this tomatoe cage for my husband. He has a tomotoe garden at the side of our house.  In the past he used wooden stakes and the tomotaoes grew every where.  We wanted more order to the chaos, so decided to order this tomotoe cage.  The plastic is light weight and easy to assemble.  Unlike other reviewers, our tomtoes have not grown very tall so we didn't have to worry about snapping the cage around the tomaotes, but that seems an easy thing to do with this prodcut.  We only ordered one of these and have more tomoatoes plants so did use wooden stakes again so we can see how the cage comapres to the stakes. Like another reviewer I wonder about the height of the cage and support for the plant.  Once the plants start growing, I can come back and do a comparison.
B000RUM0R4 I was delighted with this arrived- it is perfect. Far sturdier than any other tomato cage I have used, and versatile. I grow a wide range of indeterminate heirlooms, and this is perfect. I will be ordering more.
B000RUM0R4 This review is for the Gardeners Blue Ribbon TMC60 Ultomato Tomato Plant Cage. The cage is sturdy and provides good support, up to 4.25 feet above ground. Rating 4.5 stars.The cage is made of hard plastic.  Each stake is 5 feet (60\") in height, and 1/4\" thick. One end is slightly pointed and that end gets buried 8\" to 10\" into the ground, leaving slightly more than 4 feet above ground.  The connecting arms are 12\" long, 1/4\" thickness at the center, and 1/8\" thickness at the ends.  The circular ends of the arms snap onto the stakes. The stakes are ridged/textured so the arms don't slide up and down with weight from the plants.  The arms do glide up/down on the arms with a little bit of force in case you need to reposition them.  The stakes are sturdy and barely bend. They seem tough and durable, and are not flimsy.  The arms do bend slightly more than the stakes, but they aren't flimsy either. I would have prefered if the arms were a little bit stronger/thicker to provider stronger support.
B000RUM0R4 I planted tomato seedlings several weeks ago but did not set up the cages.  Last weekend I asked my teen son to help me do it and we pulled out a bunch of the traditional wire cages, along with the one Ultomato Cage, still in its original shipping box.  After wrestling the wire cages over the plants, trying not to break off branches or fruit, and trying to get them to stand straight in the ground, it was a breath of fresh air to break open the packaging of the Ultimato Cage and find out how easy it was to set it up, and set it around the tallest of the plants.  Since the cross bars snap on and off easily, we decided to place most of them low at the moment since the plant is not yet very tall, and we can then move them up as the plant grows, to provide support to new branches.  My son suggested I get more of that type of cage since it is so far superior to the traditional wire cages.  I came inside to try to order more and found that Amazon is not currently stocking them due to shipping difficulties.  This is so disappointing!  I ended up ordering a few more from my local ACE Hardware merchant, but as soon as Amazon has the kinks worked out I will also order more.  Ultimately, I'd like to get rid of all the wire cages and have only these, since the storage at the end of the season will be so much easier with this style of cage.  They may be a little more expensive but to me they are well worth the investment.Update: August 14th, 2013: Unfortunately, since writing my review I have become quite disappointed in the cages.  Admittedly we've had a year of heavy rain, which softened the ground, but these cages are just not holding up the weight of the plants.  Every other day I have to go out and pick them all up off the ground and try to get the stakes into the ground that little bit further so they have a chance of holding.  Now they are in so far that there isn't enough of them left to hold up the plants.  The other problem I've found is that because the bars snap on and off so easily, the weight of the plants is snapping them off, so I keep having to \"rebuild them\".  Perhaps if I try putting them on backwards (i.e. put them on the inside so the plants are leaning against them holding them on, instead of pushing against them?  But that means redoing everything all over again).  One of the cages I purchased came with a set of the bars that is missing the loop at one end so it is useless, and that cage is even weaker as a result of having fewer bars I can use with it.  The bars are also bowing quite a bit.  Just this morning I was thinking I need to google other solutions for next year since I don't think these will be it after all.The traditional metal cages are also falling over - the ground really is very wet - so perhaps in a drier year my experience would have been better.  Sorry....
B000RUM0R4 The concept is not a bad one, but in reality, the stakes are too short and too small (in diameter).  I use similar stakes in my garden for tomato plants, but I use 6 foot stakes (and they are not long enough) and the diameter is larger - and still they bend and sometimes crimp and get ruined.  This device does have a nice concept in the cross pieces, but I would hardly call this the \"Ultimate Anything\".  I think it will fulfill a need that I have for pole bean plants, but I will not be using it for tomatoes.
B000RUM0R4 I'm currently using this to grow cucumbers in a large pot.  This was super easy to put together, and has weathered a few good midwestern storms without incident. It is really ideal for what I am using it for.  I'll update if it has any trouble supporting the weight of the cukes as the summer progresses.  If things stay as is, I won't have any complaints!
B000RUM0R4 Honestly, I love it, and now I regret the time, expense and damage to my poor tomato plants caused by regular metal tomato cages. This apparatus is just like an old-fashioned Tinker-Toy, with sturdy vertical upright poles and horizontal connectors which snap on to them so that the tomato support structure can be arranged, extended and linked to any possible configuration. The best is that it can be installed around established plants, and horizontal supports added as the plant grows.
B000RUM0R4 We usually make our own homemade tomato cages with cattle fence, which is very difficult to bend. We also found that it is hard to reach through the holes in the cattle fence to pick the large tomatoes, and even some of the small cherry tomatoes that grow inside. This is a much better design than our do it yourself attempt! The Blue Ribbon Ultomato cage holds the plant up, but also has a wide opening so the ripe tomatoes are very easy to reach. If you do need to secure a section a little more it is easy to tie a section to the middle or upper stand (I use garbage bag twist ties). This is a great design and I will soon be replacing all of our homemade cattle fence stands with the Ultomato cages.
B000RUM0R4 The reason I got this product was to get my cucumbers up off the ground, as they tend to take over a lot of territory otherwise.  (See my note below on how I stake my tomatoes.)As stated in some of the other reviews, I agree that the five-foot stakes that come with this product are pretty short, but I love how this design works. The product is designed so that you can place the cross supports anywhere you want.  They don't have to be three in one location as shown in the picture.  If you need to move one cross-support up or down to accommodate a heavier, fruit-bearing branch, just do it.By the way, if you think that that 5-foot stakes will be too short, the stakes that come with this are the same standard green metal rods covered in green plastic that you can buy at any garden center.  So -- if you want more than 4 feet of stake showing above the ground, you can get longer green stakes at a garden center and use the three 5-foot stakes that come with this unit somewhere else.  The cross-supports will clip on the longer stakes in exactly the same way and you'll still be able to adjust them as needed.The bottom line is I love the simplistically clever design.  If you cage tomatoes, these are a good alternative to regular wire cages.  I just wouldn't use them with any plant that gets TOO heavy or has to withstand high winds.  As for my own personal use, this product will work just fine for my cucumbers.**RE: Tomatoes -- After many years of trial and error, I now stake my tomatoes using a single 2x2x8 pounded one-foot deep about 5 or 6 inches from the plant, then pinch off all suckers, tying up the main vine along the stake as the vine grows.  Using the single stake method is, by far, the best I've found for better production on tomato plants.  I also get more plants in less garden space, and it's easier to work around them, too. Cages were always a pain -- falling over with heavy growth, bending in high wind, and breaking.  I learned the single-stake method from a tomato grower who moved here from Romania, and after a bit of online research I learned that commercial tomato growers use similar methods in greenhouses, hanging strings from the greenhouse ceiling.  Because I don't have huge greenhouse, I tried the 2x2x8 single stake method--with great results.  That said, if I was told I had to use a cage, I would choose the Ultomato cage design over traditional wire cages, as the modular design provides greater flexibility to change/adjust the set-up as the plant grows.
B000RUM0R4 I've used these cages for the past four growing seasons and I won't go back.  In the size the come they are great for your typical determinate tomato.  I find that for the big bushy heirloom indeterminate varieties that I like to grow that I need bigger cages.  No problem, I buy a couple and make the cage fit the variety.  Four poles will do for most, but I find using six really gives me room to let the plant spread out.  That allows the plant to dry better and helps reduce fungus problems.  They cost a bit, but they last.  I use a rubber mallet to drive them in, and only loose a few poles a year (out of about 30).  These are so easy to use that I can't ever see myself going back to the old rigid cages.
B000RUM0R4 My wife and I love the adjustable arms that give a lot of flexibility.  First tomato cage we've seen that can do that.  Easy to assemble and use.
B000RUM0R4 I'm a long-time gardener who has had to give up the ground game and now must plant in 5-gallon bucket planters (SIPs) on a dirtless back patio. I was really hoping this Ultomato tomato cage would be the answer to my prayer for a structure I could set down inside my bucket planters, then remove and store at the end of the season. Oh, so close...but no cigar. The cross-pieces are just a little too long to allow the vertical rods to stand straight in the bucket, which puts unnecessary tension on the snap-on ends if you try to force it to work. I do hope the Ultomato designers will consider shortening the crosspieces slightly in the future, because this would be a fantastic product for my purposes if they would.Now, that said, I'm going to attempt to plant a bucket planter with the Ultomato just standing on the patio on the outside of the bucket, which does work fine, to see how well it supports a tomato plant once it gets large enough to need the supports. A set of crosspieces can be placed right at the top of the bucket so the bucket itself helps hold the Ultomato up until the tomato grows up into it, then those crosspieces could be moved up to the top. It could be that the weight of the 5-gallon SIP (which I make with gravel in the bottom per Pete Sims' design) will be sufficient to keep the planter itself from blowing over; maybe the Ultomato arranged outside and tied to the bucket won't go anywhere, especially when the tomato gets large enough to press down on the structure and keep it stable.If I don't come back here for an update, you can assume it worked well in the latter case and I'm too busy canning tomatoes to update my review! And, if that is the case, I'm sure I'll get more of these. I'd like to try growing some winter squash on one.
B000RUM0R4 Put mine together today and think this is a terrific idea.  I have quite a few of the large, metal cages that fold flat, but they don't fit in my earthboxes fully expanded.  These will not only fit, but the support can be customized to really provide support where it's needed.I don't buy the cheap, circular wire cages anymore because they don't hold up well, aren't as flexible as square or triangular cages and I prefer supports that fold flat for off-season storage.If a person had several of these cages, the possible configurations and uses are nearly endless.  The poles can be connected and uses to support peas, cucumbers or many other vegetables that need support.My only complaint would be that I think the price is a little high, but the prices are high on all of the decent supports and cages.
B000RUM0R4 I recently installed the Ultomato Cage on my patio tomato plant in a pot and it is working well so far.Pros:* Sturdy* Lightweight* Green color blends with tomato plant* Installs around already-growing tomato plant* Can place cross bars at whatever height is desired - place lower when the plant is smaller and move up as the plant grows* Triangular center cross-section is small enough to support the stem of a plant and also to add twine if additional tying is necessary* Disassembles for compact storage* Bamboo and plastic construction will not rust or corrodeCons:* A little more time consuming to set up compared to the 4-sided fold flat metal tomato cages* Might not be large enough or sturdy enough for large tomato plants with heavy tomatoes (eg, Beefsteak) - time will tell
B000RUM0R4 \"Do your tomato plants overtake the garden?\"  You bet!!!  We have tomato plants growing crazy this year, and have been trying to corral them so the other garden plants can breath and survive.  We have been using the common metal circular 3 ring style that requires daily maintenance to keep the branches under control.  This year, we got the Ultimate Tomato Cage for the one huge tomato plant that was missing a cage and invading surrounding plants.  WHAT A FANTASTIC INVENTION!  It was easy to put together, and to rearrange the arms after sinking the 3 stakes in the ground.  The stakes are plastic coated metal and very sturdy, and the 9 arms are plastic (not sure how long they will last in the hot AZ. sun), but I think more arms can be ordered, and also stakes, for making a bigger square cage.  I think we may be purchasing a few more of these wonderful cages, possibly for training some squash or cucumber branches up, instead of on the ground, but for it's intended purpose, tomatoes....they are the best!!!
B000RUM0R4 While a part of me still wonders if this is significantly better than a tomato cage or even a few well-positioned stakes, I can't deny that it is awesome to have around.  The assembly was easy, and I was amazed at how sturdy it was--I always worried about those flimsy tomato cages flopping over.  No, sir, this one is quite secure and so easy to move around.  This holds a new plant well, but can also be placed around an already existing plant without too much drama.  Good quality and should be appreciated by gardeners.
B000RUM0R4 Update 07/19/2013: Well, the cage has failed. My moderately-sized tomatoe plant has already proved to be too heavy for this cage. The tomatoes are just getting started and the tomatoes are going to be about medium-sized. One of the horizontal rungs has already sunk under the weight of a few of the branches and now I have an unsupported tomatoe plant.Super easy assembly and well-packed. Adjustable arms are a nice feature.I do have some doubts about how well it will support my full-grown tomato plants, but so far, so good. These stakes do have some give to them - I've seen these sold before with out the side arm supports - they are a plastic/resin type material with a wire down the center.I assembled mine BEFORE I put them into the ground - no problems there. The side support arms are easy to move around, if needed. This cage can be taken apart at the end of the season for easy storage, unlike the metal cages which take up way more space to store.I'll definitely report back at the end of the growing season. So far, no complaints!
B000RUM0R4 I was very disappointed in this purchase.  It's my fault because I should have read the description in more detail.  This is like a plastic erector set, and not very sturdy, and really not very good with tomatoes.  It worked somewhat better with my peppers and onion plants, but not with the tomatoes.  I would never recommend this product to anyone.
B000RUM0R4 I've been a tomato gardener for 20 years now, and support means everything.  This \"cage\" might be good for a determinate tomato, but for an out of control, constantly growing indeterminate variety, especially with large fruits, this will be useless.First off, this item came ridiculously bubble wrapped, and was extremely frustrating to get undone.  I managed to break off 3 snaps, rendering 3 of the supports useless.  Is that my fault?  Yes, but in my defense, the bubble wrap was so tight and glued, and wasn't easy to open up.The stakes themselves are too short, 5' and \"Strong steel core stakes\" is laughable at best.  These \"Strong steel core stakes\" are the same stakes available at Home Depot, Lowes, or any local nursery, and while they're okay, \"strong\" is not a word I'd use to describe them.  You want strong, get rebar.I ended up putting these \"Strong steel core stakes\" around an obelisk that I am using for my cucumbers, which fit perfectly when I attached the 2 remaining rows of the supports together.
B000RUM0R4 I first bought these &#34;Ultomato Cages&#34; four years ago, after having struggled with multiple other varieties of tomato cages.  I LOVED that these cages broke down into small pieces, which made them MUCH easier to store, AND I loved that I could personalize how close-together the horizontal supports were.  They were fantastic for the first two seasons, but then fell apart.  Please read below.~~~~PROS~~~~~ Tall, Five-Foot Stakes-- the height of these cages means that I can bury the first six inches or so (for support/strength) and still have PLENTY of height for my tomatoes to grow with support.  Each cage comes with three stakes, each of which are steel stakes coated in a thick plastic coating.~ Sturdy Supports-- each cage comes with nine plastic support clips that can be placed anywhere on the cage that works for that plant.  For bushier tomatoes, I always put the clips closer together near the bottom of the cage, while for leggier tomatoes, I spread them out more.  The GOOD thing is that you can buy extra supports, so you can add as many as you would like.~ Easy-to-Store-- Because this cage breaks down completely, it is VERY easy to store for the winter.~~~~CONS~~~~~ Begins to Crack After One Season, and to Break After Only Two Seasons--  The plastic coating on each stake began to crack at the end of the first season, and by the end of the second season, the steel was VERY rusty and VERY fragile.  The ends had broken off of eight of my twelve stakes by the time I set them up for the third season, and most were in five or six pieces by the middle of season three.~ The Ends Bend Easily-- Despite being made of steel, the ends bend easily, which makes it hard to push these into hard soil.I would absolutely recommend these supports as long as you don't expect them to last season-after-season.
B000RUM0R4 For the price I paid for these I expected them to do very well holding my tomatoes, well they don't.  I expected them to hold the tomatoes up nice and straight, but they sprawl all over the place and have to be attached to the cage.  I don't feel they work any better than wooden stakes or the wire cages and are not worth the price I paid for them.
B000RUM0R4 This cage is great since you can assemble it piece by piece around an already tall tomato plant without worrying about damaging the it with a traditional cage.  It does get a little tall and unwieldy so I use garden twine and tent stakes to anchor it in place.
B000RUM0R4 This seems like a great answer to a number of problems, so I am giving it a 4 star and will wait until Fall to review it again.  The standards are sturdy and substantial.  At five feet, it gives you a good amount to drive into the ground and still have height to use.  The cross-bars are substantial and the clip into place.  They seem like they will gold well, but will have to wait until a full load of tomatoes is hanging on them.  The year end cleanup is what I think will be the best deal.  Normal wire cages bend when trying to remove the old vines and they rust.  This plastic coating should solve the rust problem and having the cage come apart in pieces should make cleanup easier.  I can see getting several seasons out of this while I usually have to replace wire cages every year.  We'll have to see.
B000RUM0R4 I like the design of this tomato cage, simple though it may be. I love that it is versatile and can easily be added to established tomato plants that have already started. It is easy to snap together and install. We did tomato starters this year, but since we've had such a late start in our area our starters have gotten HUGE, so I like the design of this cage, I think it will be easier to use than a regular cage which can't be adjusted.For the price and design, definitely recommended.
B000RUM0R4 I have always used the circular  wire cages that make such a confused mess in your garage all winter, and I won't be able to replace them all (because of cost) but I really kind of like this one.  It is at least as sturdy as what I've been using, easy to use, and \"open\" enough to reach the tomatoes in the middle.I have to say that it is probably taller than a tomato will ever grow in my short season northern garden but hope springs eternal.  If you live in a normal climate I think you will love it.
B000RUM0R4 I have used wire tomato cages for years, and have found that they are have their limits. The wires do tend to get bent, and adjusting mid season for new growth in plants becomes increasingly difficult.The advantage of this tomato cage is how it can be adjusted as the growing season goes along, and because the plastic making up the stakes is firm, yet flexible, it does not have the bending problems that traditional wire cages have.The ability to adjust the height of the supports is very useful, as the plant grows throughout the year.As a product for long term use, I cannot seeing this having the issues that traditional wire cages have.
B000RUM0R4 I have tried SO MANY things to stake my tomatoes. The cheap cages. Bamboo stakes. Bamboo stakes with twine. Triangle cages I thought would do the trick, but still weren't as adjustable as I'd like.But these. These are awesome! You can move the side sections on the fly as you need to which is great. Setup is easy and storage is flat. You can even just use the stakes if you want. This would also work great for lightweight climbers like peas.I LOVE these tomato cages and plan on buying a couple more this year and slowly stocking up on them as the years go by. I think these will last for quite a few years, too, so your investment won't be a one year deal.
B000RUM0R4 Anyone who has grown tomatoes year after year knows how quickly they grow out of control, regardless of how you \"train\" them or stake them. We have used the typical circular wire tomato cages, but they've always seemed a bit flimsy and too small; and you have the problem of storing them the rest of the year.When this new tomato cage arrived, I was immediately skeptical of the quality because it was just wrapped in bubble wrap with a shipping label attached, and our UPS driver just tossed it onto the front porch. Nevertheless, the parts were all included and in good condition. After snapping the horizontal plastic support pieces into place, it was easy to embed the plastic-coated metal vertical stakes into the planter box and plant the tomato plants around it. It's much taller than the adjacent wire cages we're also using, and it appears that it will be able to support the tomato plants throughout the growing season.I will try to remember to update this review later in the growing season; the plants are just too small right now to know how effective this support system will be.Another benefit is that it will be easy to disassemble and store the Ultomato Cage throughout the winter.
B000RUM0R4 I am so delighted with this ULTOMATO TOMATO PLANT CAGE! I've used the wire circular tomato cages for more than 25 years, and every year my tomato plants far exceed the height of the cage, resulting in the cage tipping over, tomato plants breaking or tomatoes laying on the ground. This tomato cage, however, is 5 feet tall and, although plastic, very sturdy. The legs of the cage plant firmly into the ground, which should result in no more tipping. Although my tomato plants aren't at full height at this point in the growing year, I expect little or no tomato plant to rise above this cage. It's about time someone came along with a better tomato cage! I will be back to buy several more!
B000RUM0R4 We've had some Gardener's Supply metal cages for years, and thought they were as good as it gets.  Nuh-uh.  These green gems snap together easily, are TALL and will adjust as your tomatoes grow.  If you're delayed in installing them, they can be fitted around existing plants without damaging them.  Genius!
B000RUM0R4 This arrived bent. Then, when trying to straighten it out, it broke, but still worked out well enough to work OK. So, it could have been made sturdier.
B000RUM0R4 I was very excited to receive this Gardeners Blue Ribbon Ultomato Tomato Plant Cage.  I am planning on using it when my tomato plants get larger.  But for now it is staking up my raspberry bush.  And doing a great job of it!  This was sooooo simple to use straight out of the box.  The stakes are made from a sturdy material that won't rust or rot.  The clips are easy to place around the plant so that you don't destroy the plant while trying to place the stakes around it.  Also, the clips do not have to be parallel to each other.  So if part of your plant is heavy on one side and then on up a ways, it gets heavier on the other side, you can arrange the horizontal clips in any configuration you like to best support your plant.  When done this cage is very easy to store.  You just unclip the horizontal bars and everything wraps up with a twisty tie until next year.  These will definitely be something I purchase more of for the garden.  Some real thought went into these product!
B000RUM0R4 I have struggled with tomato cages for years and though this might be a solution. The long stakes are just green plant stakes, I had a bit of trouble getting them in the ground, and the side supports went on easy. Vine says I have to review in 30 days now, tomatoes are 17 inches high, will report back at the end of the season.
B000RUM0R4 I like this cage a lot.  The arms can be adjusted to where you want them, and snapped around the plant instead of put over it, potentially breaking the vines.  It's as tall as other stakes and cages I've bought.  The problem with the metal ones is they get bent up really bad and it makes them hard to reuse more than a year or two.  This one looks like it will last.  In fact, I've got this actually placed between two jellybean tomato plants.  I've got each plant staked with a plain straight stake, and then this between them with the branches trained and supported on the arm supports.  This is going to make it a lot easier to get to the little tomatoes as they ripen, especially when you want to reach and just eat some off the vine.  With the branches going back and forth through here, the clusters show up well.
B000RUM0R4 It is still early days for a full review - I think if these make it to next year in the garage I'll have to edit this review up to five stars. Seems like nothing survives my garage...The poles are very sturdy and provide plenty of room for large (and growing larger ^_^) tomato plants or other plants that vine out of control.  I've got it supporting one of my bigger tomato plants and it is doing just dandy.The poles are some kind of plasti-composition with little bumps on them which I think gives them a weird feel but it allows the plants to grasp better too I suppose.  These poles are taller than I am.
B000RUM0R4 We just staked some of our tomatoes and two Knock Out roses with these. Unlike another reviewer our stakes were solid, the same kind you get at your local big box hardware store.  We did sink the stakes about 6 inches in the ground (just like we do other stakes).  We did the roses because they are so filled with blooms they needed support.  It was nice these were green because they aren't visible at all. We found ours locally.
B000RUM0R4 This is a solid tomato plant cage, and can easily recommend.Pros:- Flexible arms (guide them to the fruit laden branches for support)- Tough stakes - hard to bend, will keep it grounded.- Can place it around an already growing plant (with a little effort, but much easier than a regular wire cage) without damaging the plant.- Stores flat - can reuse next year, and the one after.Neutral:- Look for sales, you can get them for a  lot less at other stores.Recommended, especially in the $5-7 dollar range.
B000RUM0R4 Unfortunately the product came damaged during shipping, and it was not as sturdy as I thought it would be. It seems to be doing better than the cheap cages I have been using. I wish the product would be wider to support the plant as it grows bigger.
B000RUM0R4 As someone that has fought with more than my share of rusty or bent traditional tomato cages, I was happy to see this alternative.  Granted, it will be awhile to see if it shows weather wear, this is a solid cage that can be used to grow more than just tomatoes.  Any item from food to flowers could benefit from the climbing range and support.I prefer the shape of the support over the traditional round cage.  That circle shape was constantly getting dented or broken.  It just didn't make sense.  This gives more structured support and the greater height means I won't have plants breaking from climbing too high.I also found it easy to move as well as store.Overall, this is a great way to give your plants the best start to produce the most product...whether it be fruits, vegetables, or flowers.
B000RUM0R4 The tomato went together really well.  It plants tomatos great!  The vines really go together really well.  They go right into the ground.  Great tomatos!  They hang really well.
B000RUM0R4 I am actually using this for cucumbers instead of tomatoes and so far it's working great!  It was easy to assemble and fit my pot nicely.  I have very little space, so I'm growing most everything in large pots and having something like this really comes in handy for plants that like to climb.  I am very pleased with it.  It appears to be very sturdy as well so I hope to get lots of years of use from it.
B000RUM0R4 Don't expect this cage can hold the weight of beefsteak tomato. This cage is designed for grape or cherry tomatoes.I agree with other reviewer that this cage is very sturdy. It is sturdy for small tomato plant. I have about half dozen tomato plants and I use the cage for \"sun sugar\" tomato, a cherry type. For bigger tomato such as Burpee big mama and other large paste tomato, I use the larger cages from burpee.com or gardeners.com
B000RUM0R4 Seems like a good idea, create brackets that clip to some of those standard corrugated green garden stakes, then sell as a package. The problem is, this was shipped just in plastic and bubble wrap, with nothing to protect the stakes, so it showed up totally bent (and trying to bend it back to shape causes the stake to crack in half). I uploaded a pic to the product page if you want to have a look.My suggestion to the company would be to sell just the brackets (easy to ship) and have people use their own stakes. Or send them in a box.
B000RUM0R4 I have tried various methods to tie, stake, cage, etc. tomato plants for years. I thought I'd found the perfect solution with this product. However, I have not. I should have noticed from the picture, that the cage (stakes) are merely green plant stakes. That kind the ultimately don't work to hold up tomatoes! The length of the stakes is really on the short side as well as the diameter of the stakes (a bit too thin) allowing them to bend rather easily.Putting the cage together was pretty easy and I do like that cross section. My tomato plants aren't full grown yet. I intend to come back and edit the review accordingly. For now, I'll say it's \"just okay\".
B000RUM0R4 As with most people I know in the Northwest, we are avid gardeners and optimists to the max when it comes to being able to raise tomato plants.  Still, we have figured out that you need short times for ripening and you need to keep your plants well supported.To that end, I decided to give this product a try.  Things that really interested me were the following:1.  Compact storage:  There is NEVER enough room to store all of the garden stuff an that especially applies to tomato cages.  Most are very bulky, but this one breaks down into small and easy to store pieces.2.  Moveable supports:  I have not yet found a tomato plant that will put it branches just where the preformed supports are in most tomato cages.  Thus, having the ability to move a support to where it is needed is great.3.  Metal stakes that are plastic coated:  The base construction of this unit uses plant supports that I have used for years in the garden.  They are basically hollow metal stakes that are plastic coated.  I have several that are over 15 years old and are still providing garden structure support.4.  Extra supports are available:  Amazon carries extra support cross members, but there is a catch, you have to have an order that totals more than $25 or they will delete it from your order!!!!  So, if you think you want extra supports, order them at the same time you order your plant supports!Here is what I liked about working with the product:1.  Very easy to assemble and the assembly can be accomplished either before the plant is in the ground or after the plant is in the ground.  Personally, I think it is much easier to put the unit together, install it in the ground, and then plant your plant.  Keep in mind that you MUST insert the legs of this unit at least 12 inches into your ground if you want it to provide good support for a heavy tomato plant!!!!!!!!!!!!  that is NOT mentioned anywhere in their instructions, but it is what most gardener's would do if they were building their own support.2.  Once assembled and installed in the ground, it is VERY easy to move support members around!!!  Remember to follow the directions about clipping the supports on from the inside and NOT from the outside.3.  The green color of the materials disappear into the foliage of the plants making it more visually appealing.Here is what I did not like about the product:1.  Amazon limiting the ability to order extra supports unless your total order is more than $25.  The way it is worded on the website, it looks like free shipping is limited unless the order is more than $25.  That is not what they are saying,  your ability to order it at all is limited to the fact that your total order must be at least $25 or they will remove it from your order.  This makes no sense to me since there are many low cost items that you can order on Amazon.  Thus, if you order some batteries for $5 and supports for $15 for a total order of $20, they will remove the supports from the order and only ship out the $5 of batteries!  What sense does that make???????????Overall, I am currently happy with the product, but will need to come back and update this after the growing season to be able to add how well this works with plants as they grow.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good and flexible support system.  Just remember my caution about including any additional supports you want with your order.
B000RUM0R4 Everyone by now has seen these green plastic coated garden poles, they are everywhere. What this company has done is create clips that hold fast to the 4 ft size of these poles to make a sturdy triangular cage, and sturdy it is. The reason I am giving it 5 stars is because buying the poles and clips together as a cage is a very good value. The clips are approx a dollar each, and the poles are a bit more, so getting them as a kit saves money. Gardener's Blue Ribbon also sells the cross bar \"ties\" separately, so you can add them as needed when your plant gets large. Obviously, I am reviewing this in May, so my tomato plants are not quite at that stage - yet. I am buying more of these to replace the conical wire cages (good riddance), so let that be my ultimate review.
B000RUM0R4 I've used these cages for two seasons now and just got around to writing a review. I'll probably use them next season, too, but I think potential buyers should be aware of some things.The \"cage\" comes as a set of three stakes and nine plastic bars; both ends of the bar snap onto a stake, usually assembled as you see in pictures (three groups of three bars, although you can really space them however you want). I've lost a couple plastic bars over the years, but I notice some local garden centers sell replacement bars, probably for this reason. I suppose you could also get them to add another set of bars to the cage. The stakes are 5 ft tall, but you'll have to put them into the ground a bit, making the effective height a bit less.The stakes are also somewhat thin, and the bars are easily removable. This is good because it makes for easy storage but can be bad because heavy plants--like tomatoes--can easily push the bars off the stakes (probably why I've lost a couple). Together with the thin stakes, this makes the whole cage somewhat light and definitely NOT suitable for indeterminate tomatoes. You may have better luck with determinates, but I've never grown any true determinates in these to test. I've given up on using these for tomatoes and have stuck to using them with bell peppers, jalapenos (probably could have done without any cage on those, but I had some extra), and cucumbers, which I more or less successfully tried to make climb up the cage. The removable--and movable--plastic bars on the cage were very helpful for this. I didn't have an issue with the weight of the cucumber fruit weighing down the cage, toppling it over, or breaking the bars off, but everything was much lighter here than my tomatoes. I suspect other plants like peas would also work well (maybe spread it out instead of putting it like a cage, depending on how you plant them). I'd hate to try it with melons or squash, but if I was desperate for space and had nothing else I might see how it works.In summary, these cages are OK, but you'll need to stick to lighter plants: *maybe* determinate tomatoes, definitely *not* indeterminates, and besides tomatoes otherwise lighter plants like cucumbers or peppers. If they didn't market these for tomatoes (including the name of the cage itself!), I might rate them a little higher. They aren't horrible, but you'll have to be careful how you use them. For tomatoes themselves, after having used a variety of tomato support methods, I decided to make a \"Florida weave\" last season with not much more than metal T-posts and twine. (There are also a few other \"homemade\" solutions out there.\") Do a Web search for this if you're interested--it worked out well for me and was much less expensive than buying cages. They're also easy to store, and I suspect the metal posts will last me much, much longer than these cages.
B000RUM0R4 This tomato (or any plant) cage is sturdy, adjustable and reusable. The three supporting poles are made of a strong metal core with a hard plastic covering. This covering has ridges which keeps the adjustable horizontal attachment bars from slipping down the pole when the weight of the tomato branches increases with the growing season. I have accidentally broken off many stems/branches in the past when trying to accommodate the growing plant within a fixed support cage - the plant grows or needs extra support when branches become heavy with fruit, and the traditional fixed metal cages do not allow adjustments without bending/breaking stems in the process. This design allows you accommodate the plant as often as needed by adjusting the horizontal bars of the cage as often as you need to.  They snap on and off easily and can be placed anywhere on the vertical poles. By connecting several cages in a row, you can build a network of supports for many plants.  This is the best method I have tried so far, compared to fixed square and round cages and wooden stakes. I have yet to use it a second season, and the plastic horizontal bars may not hold up to years of wear and tear - they are plastic and less sturdy than the poles. But each cage comes with many bars, so extras are available in the event of a breakage.
B000RUM0R4 Makes growing tomatoes much easier. The cage could be used for growing tomato plants and other climbing fruits and vegetables. It is literally a \"snap\" to use, as the horizontal supports, snap on and off with ease. Three stakes and nine adjustable support clips for changeable support throughout the plant's growth. The stakes have a steel core and a thick plastic coating. It may also be used , flattened as a trellis.
B000RUM0R4 I moved from a ranch to a condo, and needed to start over with my approach to vegetable gardening.  I knew that I would be starting with an heirloom tomato in a City Pickers box, and when I saw this tomato cage offered via the Amazon Vine program, I grabbed it.Because it takes a while to see the longevity of a product that will be in the sun most of the day, I can't comment yet on the durability of the product.  Let's just say that I am a bit skeptical about the cross pieces lasting longer than one season, as it they are constructed out of plastic.  The uprights are constructed out of steel coasted with plastic, but they are rather lightweight.PROS:The tomato cage was easily assembled.  I had it put together and in the box in no time. The design is very clever.  I like it a lot better than the wire tomato cages that are metal cones (seeGalvanized Tomato Cage 33\"X12\"-3 Ring/3 Legs) which I have found to be flimsy and easily bent out of shape.  (At my previous residence I had the most success with homemade cages assembled from leftover field fencing supported by metal fence posts. Field fence has generous spacing between the wires.)CONS:The directions say to put the cage about 8 - 10 inches deep into the soil.  That does not seem very deep if one expects to support a large tomato plant.  I had no control over the depth that I had to set mine in, as it's in a box. (see product images) I get the feeling that once my tomato plant gets to a  large size that I am going to need to fasten the cage to the balcony rail to keep it from toppling over.  But, that's speculation at this point.I know that this review is incomplete at this point, and I do apologize about that.  But I do intend to post updates throughout the upcoming growing season.  Stay tuned for further developments....Three stars for now, as I am a bit skeptical about how well this cage is going to work out.UPDATE:  June 4, 2013I have had the cage in place for a month.  I must say that my opinion of this cage is slowly sinking in the west.  I had to add a row of string as an additional support for my young tomato plant.  I also had to fasten it to my balcony railing with zip ties, as even a moderate breeze would send it leaning to the side.  I decided to anchor it down before it tipped over and took my tomato with it.  See product images.Final opinion:  A waste of money unless you have some way to support it.
B000RUM0R4 This is only my 3rd year growing tomatoes so I am still a novice gardener. Since I live in a condo, all my gardening is done in containers--usually 5-gallon buckets. Even though this tomato cage is not intended for containers, I was able to make it work because it is so adjustable and versatile.The cage arrives UNASSEMBLED but assembly is easy. There are 3 5-ft. stakes and 9 support clips. The support clips snap onto the stakes very easily (it reminded me of a large Tinker Toy project). What's great is that, as your plant grows, you can readjust the space between the support rods to support your plant's branches and fruit/vegetables. This isn't something you can do with most other tomato cages.As noted in the product description, the stakes have a steel core with plastic around them. They are VERY strong. However, the support clips are completely plastic and I would recommend not being to rough with them during assembly or readjustment during growth of your plant. I did not have any breakage but, in \"forcing\" the cage to fit my 5-gallon bucket, the clips were definitely bending.I just put my tomato plants in yesterday so I can't speak yet to how well the cage functions in supporting the plant's growth, but since it is so adjustable, I can't imagine there being much of a problem. If there is, I will update my review once my plants have grown a few feet tall.I have never had a cage this tall so I'm looking forward to having less work this year in keeping my plants supported as they grow and bear fruit!I took a picture of my cage in the container with the small tomato plant to show customers, but unfortunately this company is not allowing customers to share their own images of the product.4 stars for now. This may change as my plant grows.
B000RUM0R4 Great tomato cage that can be added to your tomato plant at any time (and adjusted, as needed).  It's sturdy, adjustable, and green (it blends it with the plant and is barely noticeable).
B000RUM0R4 These vegetable support stakes are a nice 5 feet tall which leaves you at least 4 to 4 1/2 feet once you get it stuck in the ground.  They are coated metal and went into the ground easily on the pointed in.  I didn't even have to use a rubber mallet on them.  If you do have to use a rubber mallet on them, be sure to protect the coating on the stake with a piece of cloth before pounding.  They come with 9 connectors that are 12inches long and snap into place easily so you can configure them anyway you want.  You can make a triangle or free form shape.  They are green and unobtrusive looking.  Rather than tomatoes, I used them for my pole beans that are growing like skyscrapers.  After the pole beans are done, I will move them to my tomatoes which aren't very tall yet.  I'm am pleased with this product and would recommend it.  My only concern would be if the connectors will break of their end clips or not as I reconfigure them.  So far, no problem.
B000RUM0R4 We plant 20-30 tomato plants each year, plus I use tomato cages for climbing plants, like peas.  The Gardeners Blue Ribbon Tomato Plant Cage is a sturdy, versatile product that not only can be used for any size tomato plant, but can also be arranged for other uses.The cage comes disassembled, with three tall poles and 9 side pieces. You just put the poles in the ground and then snap on the side pieces in any arrangement you would like.The price is higher then your typical cage and I would be a little concerned about keeping track of the side pieces once you put the cages away after the growing season. However, the durability and flexibility of this product outweighs the cons.
B000RUM0R4 Even though this product appears a little flimsy, it's lack of rigidity is actually a benefit over some other more rigid tomato plant growers I've used.  I've been happy with it so far.
B000RUM0R4 At first glance this seemed pretty flimsy. The plastic coating fooled me into thinking that it was solid plastic for a moment.  But it's plastic coated steel, which makes for a robust and probably long-lived outdoor product.  Once assembled, it can actually stand on its own on a solid surface which is something one of those flimsy not-quite-wire-but-almost cages can't do.  It looks like it's going to support even the heaviest stalks without tipping over, which is something I have longed for in my tomato cages.  I'm tired of having to readjust them virtually every day.The modular design is really brilliant.  Getting bonked in the head by the uprights a couple of times during assembly is a fair trade-off for dealing with the wobbly, never-quite-fits-together-properly quality of lesser cages.  The cross-bars snap on and snap off easily making for compact winter storage as well as easy reassembly.The price is more than fair for what you get. I look forward to many years of tomato-growing with the Ultomato
B000RUM0R4 I bought tomato cages for $.99 each at the hardware store. I'll use this for flat beans. The one good thing is that you can do that, open the panels and make a \"wall\" of them, if you want. I hope for the price that it lasts more than one season.
B000RUM0R4 Seems like a good idea, though perhaps it should be used for plants that are going to stay a reasonably small size (unlike, say, Sungold tomatoes). Of course I won't really know how well it works until I have it supporting a fully grown tomato plant, and I won't have any of those for about ninety days. However, since Vine members are now required to have reviews in within thirty days, I guess this will have to do for now. Perhaps I can add something else later in the year.Sep 18. Still doing a good job of supporting a \"Goliath\"plant which has already produced around 20lbs of big tomatoes. One of the nice things about it is being able to move the crossbars, which I have done as the plant has grown. It's now around four feet tall. Very pleased with it.
B000RUM0R4 This was a great addition to our garden this year as I had planted my tomato plant before getting this.  I was able to add it after-the-fact without breaking the branches because I added the posts and then the supports.I love that you can adjust the supports to put them where you need the support the most, and that you can move them as the plant grows.This type of plant cage also makes it take up VERY little space when you need to store it.
B000RYL1BQ The current picture photo shows folding wings which can extend out to turn the compost.  The unit I received has no moving parts, but a welded piece that goes out into two posts.  Ultimately I'm happier with this design as it feels like it has much less change of breaking.  Although based on the looks of the 'winged' one it appears as it might have been easier to insert into the compost pile.It gets the job done, allowing you to insert it into the compost pile, turn and get it worked up.  I have let my compost bin go too long all to often, forgetting to rotate and move the compost, but this aerator is an easy way to get it stirred up.
B000RYL1BQ I started my first compost last summer.  Before then, my sum experience with compost was dumping coffee, peels, and veggie parts in a trench in my garden.  I made some mistakes with theGood Ideas EZCJR-BLK 7-Cubic-Foot Compost Wizard Jr., particularly in its placement.  It was in a back corner of my yard and even though I shoveled it out for a few months, eventually it ended up under a few feet of snow.  My sum total of compost was about a gallon.  I can't believe I put that much stuff in there and ended up with such a small amount.Back to the drawing board.  I went back to my garden compost and discovered that I had a lot of rich dirt that had continued after I abandoned it.  That is where is used the aerator, to pull the compost out and rotate it and move it around the garden.  The first few lifts of it were much heavier and it wasn't as easy to pull out.  But this aerater is exactly what I needed to rotate the ground.  It opens up as I pull it out, and it makes it do a lot, very easily.
B000RYL1BQ My daughter picked the compost project in last school year (middle school). It turned out not too bad for our garden. So, I kept doing compost for fertilizing our garden. This compost aerator is easy to get into the center of the compost pile. But the wings (or fins) at the bottom usually stick together and don't move the compost. Once a while, one of the wing does open when I pull this aerator out, but not always. Not sure if I does not use this tool correctly or I just got a bad unit.
B000RYL1BQ I agree with other reviewers (all of whom I read before ordering) about the wings not opening with regularity when plunging this tool into the compost pile.That being said, this tool has great thrust, is easy for even my arthritic hands to use, and doesn't require a lot of upper-body strength to do a reasonable turning session of a single compost pile.  I've taken the other reviewers suggestions to plunge it in at a slight angle then give it a twist to open the wings, before pulling it up. This seems to work well.  This is also how I discovered that my beloved BioBag Food Waste Bio Bags, 3 Gallon 25 ea that I use for composting, are NOT degrading at all (as they came up impaled on the wings), so now I simply empty them into my bins, and throw the bags into the regular trash.I'm hopeful that this tool speeds up the process of composting in my bins, especially now that the warmer weather is coming.  I do love all of that glorious black soil!
B000RYL1BQ I actually didn't realize there was a tool specific for this purpose until I saw this!I have a large compost bin, and tried using a shovel and a pitchfork to turn it over (which it needs regularly to make good compost).  Neither was effective or easy.This aerator is both -- it is a huge help in making compost.  Compost gets clumped very easily, especially during the rainy season, and this really helps to aerate it, as well as turn things under and keep things generally rotated.  I definitely recommend this to someone who composts a lot.
B000RYL1BQ This compost aerator is sturdy with quality, solid construction. A great tool for turning or churning your compost pile/bin.Help other customers find the most helpful reviews

B000RYL1BQ The materials that this Aerator was manufactured from, were worthless.  I took it out of the box, and went outside to stir my compost pile.  Two days ago, I had removed the sticks, which had mixed into the vines, leaves and such that were in the pile. This left me with about a foot of well degraded plant material, mixed with dirt, and random fine roots.  I started to jab the pointed  end into the pile. However, the wings which are suppose to fold down and then stir the pile, simply stayed up. I would pull them down manually, and when it was placed back into the pile, they'd immediately fold back up. &#34;At least the bottom tip is mixing up the mulch&#34; I thought to myself.  After about 15-20 minutes, I looked at the tip, which was bent to the side about 45 degrees. The cheap paint on the steel (?) had flaked off the tip too.Usually garden tools last a lifetime. In fact, I have garden tools I inherited from uncles long dead, so they are lasting TWO lifetimes.  Nevertheless I can accept if a garden tool only lasts a few decades.  Or at least lasts a few years.  But when you get a tool, and it only lasts a FEW MINUTES?  Perhaps the company changed the materials that they make the aerator from, or they changed the company that they subcontracted to mold the metal tip. If you look at other recent reviews, others have also encountered the tip bending over, or the wings that bend down so you can stir, not bending down.  I hope the company fixes this problem, because this seems to be a good tool for mixing the compost pile.  Unless you have a shovel.
B000RYL1NE I ordered the Yard Butler Gopher/Mole Bait Applicator to use with voles.  The method is the same: 1. Look for evidence of tunnels running through the yard; 2. Probe with the unit to enter the tunnel; 3.  When you feel the &#8220;drop&#8221; of entering a cavity, stop at that point; and 4) Turn the crank on top of the unit and dispense pellets into the tunnel.  It takes a bit of practice, but is easily performed.
B000RYL1NE After I've cleared the drybrush and trees from the slope behind my backyard, a gopher infestation exploded in my lawns.  Never to be outsmarted by rodents, I tried a wide variety of anti-gopher weaponry, including this Yard Butler Mole/Gopher Bait Applicator.Likes:*Sturdy metal spike applicator with a t-bar handle and foam grips.*Fairly easy to use: place bait/poison in the top container, insert the spike tip into the gopher hole, and turn the dispenser handle on top to dispense the gopher tidbits (available separately).Results after two weeks:*I don't know whether the gophers were immune to the bait, or the poison actually worked and some other predators dug up their decaying carcasses, but I ended up with newly dug holes around the baited areas along with a good sized mini &#34;pitcher's mound&#34;.Conclusion:Gopher bait/poison did not work for me.  It only aggravated more gophers to dig more holes.  The only dead gopher was one that drowned in my pool, but that was weeks after applying the bait.  Now I'm also concerned about poisoning predators such as hawks, coyotes, possums, and skunks, that are important in the food chain.  I'm not using any more gopher bait/poison, but this applicator is very handy as a probe for locating gopher tunnels and implementing other weapons of rodent destruction.  If all else fails, time to call the pros.
B000RYL1NE This Applicator works good, but my Gophers have not died yet, or I have not notice it yet!I live on 10 acres ,on a river, we have allot of huge boulders, where thegophers like to hide.So its not always possible to get into the area that there in!I have to plant all veggies etc. in Large containers, but if a  veggies drops to theground without a piece of wood there, gophers are on it, and of course at night.I'm not seeing the ground coming up, but mainly Gopher holes, that is where I'm sticking thistube at and realeasing the pellets into, then covering it upThat said, this Yard Butler Bait Applicator works very good..I know other friends that have this, and forthem it gets there Gophers..Going to keep trying to get those suckers.If I notice a big difference I will be back to give a up-date.
B000RYL1NE Every winter and spring its mole war around my neighborhood. I've tried countless poisons and old school tricks with no real positive results. When the opportunity came along to test this Yard Butler bait applicator I was glad to give it a test run. The instructions are mounted on the tool and are quite simple. It takes seconds to load and its one of the cleanest ways to apply poison. The wing nut does a good job of locking down the feed box. I got a pretty good seal without any product loss. I particularly like the mechanics on this puppy. The barrel easily slides into the tunnel for a quick application of bait. Two weeks later and no new mole activity. The manufacturer tacks on a life time warranty. So far so good. I have no problem recommending this great, working device. Its built to last.
B000RYL1NE Works ok.  It does get jammed at the exit hole at times but I kind of expected that.  The real issue is finding some sort of bait that will actually work with this thing and actually gets rid of your vermin problem...  The only thing that has worked for my occasional mole visitor has been poison gummy worms.  I will use this to make the hole and drop the worms in...
B000RYL1NE Our problem is with moles.  With the soil we have here in SW Washington, this applicator works great and it hasn't jammed on me yet.  Using disposable gloves to load this applicator keeps human scent off the bait.  Very happy to have this applicator, I wasn't aware that something like this even existed.
B000RYL1NE This bait applicator is a quality item which will last for years. It is easy to operate, and the bait is easy to apply. I like that is it made of a coated metal, and that the handles have foam. We are using this for our growing vole problem, and I prefer to apply bait in a direct manner rather than  broadcast bait where non-targeted species might get at it.Recommended.
B000RYL1NE If you have a mole problem, this is a great tool to help rid the yard of this troublesome critter. This applicator has two main advantages over placing mole bait by hand. First, if you use latex gloves to load it, you can avoid human odor on the bait, which may render the bait useless given the sensitive noses of moles. Second, of course, you can apply the bait in various places around the yard while standing, and when finished simply hang the applicator in your yard shed or garage.I've found that, although the process is quite simple, it can be tricky to get the bait pellets in the right spot. The tunnels are easy to spot in most lawns and gardens, but placing the bait is important. Even if you happen to collapse part of the tunnel, moles love to reopen them if it means getting at some food. However, I think it is best to cover the hole left by the applicator with some dry leaves and a little soil on top of that. This way, the bait is somewhat protected from other creatures and the weather, plus it is easy to see where bait has been placed if you wish to check on whether it's been eaten.Bottom line: if you have a mole problem and tried a number of approaches to getting rid of them, this applicator may help. In my opinion, traps are effective if they are placed just so (I've had little luck with them), but bait and mole-killer &#34;worms&#34; work best.
B000RYL2CY This does a great job of allowing me to use my front yard hose without crawling through shrubbery to get to the house spigot.  The shape and support leg are a benefit to stability.  I hadn't considered how I'd need a short extension hose to reach from it to the spigot, nor that I'd have to have a hose hanger next to it and have had to buy both to augment this unit.  But one benefit from having the extender separate from the hose holder is that I don't have to worry about the weight of the coiled hose tipping it nor will I have any issue accessing its spigot through the coils of a hose hanging over it.The unit goes into the ground pretty easily (I used a small sledge hammer on the support leg) and sinks far enough down to make it very sturdy.  It is a hollow square shape that allows dirt to fill in the middle of the buried part as you sink it.  You get better purchase in the ground than with a single rod structure.  Both my extender hose and regular hose attached with no leaks.  That's especially key with the extender hose since the spigot at the house is always on so you are counting on this unit to stop the flow when not in use.I had such an arrangement in the past but the extender was very low to the ground, where this one is about 18&#34; out of the ground and an easy height to access.  Its color is muted and blends in with the shrubbery so doesn't attract attention.
B000RYL2CY This would have been a great product if it didn't leak. It is all metal and has brass fittings. There are no plastic parts. I used some of that white teflon tape where the hose connection goes, but the part that connects the fitting to the pole also leaked. I had to use one of those plumbing/welding products to stop that leak. So far it is holding up.
B000RYL2CY Our hydrant is practically at ground level in an area that's frequently overgrown, so groping around for the handle in tall grass, stopped over, has always been unnerving (Kansas is spider country). This extender is great for keeping my off my hands and knees and away from the creepy crawlers.I do wish it came with a leader, but I was able to make a custom one of just the right length in about 5 minutes with some scrap hose and a couple of menders (like this one: http://www.amazon.com/Gilmour-Polymer-Male-Coupling-01M/dp/B00002N66T and this one http://www.amazon.com/Gilmour-Polymer-Female-Coupling-01F/dp/B00002N66U/--I went with the cheapies because I've used them before and I won't be taking the leader on and off, and they're not in direct sunlight). I used teflon tape at the connectors, and added a splitter (I used this one, which has big, easy lever handles: http://www.amazon.com/Nelson-Rezimar-High-Water-Kink-Free-50315/dp/B0015AOEYC/), so now I have two hoses in a stable base at a good height. Hooray!The fittings are nice brass fittings. I did use teflon tape, but didn't replace the old hose gaskets, and I had no leaks at the input or outputs, even under pressure. The frame looks to be powder coated steel in dark green to camouflage in bushes, square tubular metal, nice and heavy.It's a bit hard to push in and not 100% stable in really rocky soil (ours is basically gravel held together with fine topsoil), but that's tru of pretty much anything jammed into the ground around our building, since you essentially have to rock it in--just giving a warning if you have really rocky soil.
B000RYL2CY Unfortunately I'm not able to recommend this product as it appears to have poor quality control. This arrived with a broken handle/hose bib despite no evidence of wear/tear to the box or packing. Basically unable to use in current condition and trying to find a replacement hose bib that fits to repair isn't worth the time or effort of driving across town with this thing in tow. AVOID.
B000RYL2CY I'm using mine next to my vegetable garden.  I am a square foot gardener so I have raised beds & I have to keep them fenced in with chicken wire or the rabbits will eat everything.  The fence has always been a problem when watering because the hose hangs over/on the fence & causes it to sag.  But with this yard butler, I can get enough height to clear the chicken wire.It was easy to set up.  I used a block of wood on top & then pounded it into the ground with a hammer.  Don't use a hammer on the metal butler itself or you will likely cause damage.Mine has been working for 2 weeks so far with no leaks.  From reading other reviews, it seems there are good/bad ones; I guess I got a good one.  I'll update my review if it goes bad.
B000RYL2CY I have two gardens, one off of each end of the house. They need a lot of watering. It's always been extra work adjusting the water flow from the hose. (Walking back and forth to the house each time). I tried the hose \"Y's\" which have a switch to adjust the flow at the garden, but they're on the ground, generally upside down and are hard to adjust since the levers are very small.The Bib Extender has been placed next to the garden with the hose attached. With the faucet on at the house, it is an easy and convenient way to adjust the water flow.  It is up a couple of feet and has a good faucet handle. The shaft which goes into the ground is very solid and the whole unit is simple. I did find that it is important to use a pliers to tighten the hose connection onto the Bib Extender to prevent leaks. I also find this true on the house faucets since the \"rubber\" seals are generally plastic, not rubber anymore. I have had the water on at the house for a few days and see no problem with leaking. I will just leave the water on at the house and use only the Bib Extender for turning on and off the water and making adjustments.As of May 24, 2014 the on/off handle broke off in just normal use. The product should not be purchased.
B000RYL2CY When driving this into the ground, I would recommend instead of pounding on the top of the main stake, use a stone or small cement block to pound on the perpendicular welded piece of metal that's attached about six inches from the bottom. The metal was welded on well enough there was no danger of deformation or detachment when I did so. A little paint did chip off, however. Because of this perpendicular piece of metal, you can only drive it down about 6\". If your soil is a bit looser on top, it's not deep enough to keep the stake from wobbling a bit, but enough to keep it in place.The connection threads are really short - less than half an inch for both sides. I would have liked it to be a little longer since I just feel as if there's a better, more secure connection that way. If you leave the included washer in on the incoming connection, the length to connect shortens to about 1/4 inch. I used teflon tape where I could, and have had no issues with leaking around the connections.The faucet points more horizontal than vertical so if you add connections (I attached a 4-way manifold), it juts out, I would estimate, about 70 degrees from the stake. Besides being unsightly, the water shoots out from my manifold mostly horizontally instead of down. It makes it difficult if you're just trying to drop water down from the faucet into a bucket or watering can. With a little testing, you can learn to open the faucet just enough with a low enough flow the water will flow mostly down, hold the bucket up next to the faucet, or just figure out where to place your bucket on the ground wherever the water ends up falling. More guesswork than I would like to bother with.This bib extender works for the basic need of placing a faucet in another location.
B000RYOAHS To cut to the chase - this isn't worth the current $35 price for my uses.I really like some of the design features on this cultivator.  I like how the rotary blade assemblies are modular and can be replaced one at a time, or simply removed one by one to allow for a different tilling pattern in your garden.  That's pretty cool.  I also like the twist-lock feature on the extendable handle, versus other tools that I have that screw to tighten.  At least for me, the handle was very easy to lock/unlock in position, and it didn't come loose when I was using it.While I do love the twist-lock on the handle, one downside is that you can only go between the two lengths of fully-retracted or fully-extended.  You can't customize the length anywhere in between.  The length worked for me, and I'm 5'9\".The reason for my rating this as just \"OK\" with three stars is that it didn't churn up my soil very well.  Yes, I put my back into it.  :)  I tried it on my lawn before reseeding, which was essentially compacted top soil, and also on a couple of other areas that have more loose dirt.  I wasn't too impressed by how much effort it took for so little turnover on the soil.  Now, that might just be because my soil is more compacted than most and that I really need a powered tiller, but unless you have looser soil - you might experience the same thing.So, I was impres
B000RYOAHS Everything about this product is well made and works well except for one thing...The handle bar collapses too easily during use.  The handle bar is a simple twist lock, much like my pruner's bars (which work very well).  And if you want to have a 1/2 length bar for tilling, then this product works great.  But, I suspect most people will want to stand while tilling, and the handle bar, even though well tightened, collapses too easily under regular use.So, while everything else about this cultivator is nicely made, this one fatal flaw prevents it from being truly useful.
B000RYOAHS I used this cultivator for my existing flower gardens and for a few smaller sections of hard-packed yard.In both areas, the cultivator worked well (though to be honest, if I needed to work hard-packed areas of the yard, I would use my electric cultivator).I found that the adjustable handle worked well. I initially had problems where it would collapse as I was using it. It turns out that you need to turn the handle until you hear a soft click. Once it clicks, the handle stays in place.Configuring the blades was also very easy. Each blade is screwed into place with a bolt that&#8217;s large enough so that it&#8217;s easy to turn. It took less than a minute to add or remove a blade.Overall, I liked using this cultivator.
B000RYOAHS This tool is great for loosening the top 2-3 inches of soil in the garden. It does take a lot of muscle power and you certainly will get a workout with it. The more compact the soil, the more difficult it will be to use.I would recommend this product for gardens where the soil is not too compacted and hard. In that case you may need a power tiller. This product is great for small areas. It helps to break up weeds, but not the kind that send long roots.
B000RYOAHS A bad back is a problem when you like to garden since pretty much every gardening task puts a strain on your back. While this is not a perfect solution, it provides for less back strain than using a hoe for weeding.The build quality is pretty good. It feels solid, but is lightweight to handle. The telescoping action of the handle is easy to use (simple twist lock) and stays put when extended except for the most severe pushing. The tiller blades (or prongs, actually) are sharp and each can be removed to configure the tool for specific tasks, such as edge weeding. The blades are held in place with a nut that goes right through the blade frame, which is far better than a friction fit that other similar tools have.The catch is that this is not something that will replace a digging hoe or tiller. It&#8217;s for light weeding on ground that has been well-worked. For that task it performs well and offers the advantage that you don&#8217;t have to use a lift and chop motion as you would with a hoe, but rather a back and forth motion. I find that easier on my back.It also works well to help spread out pine bark mulch, avoiding the need to bend as much during that task. The rotating tines even out the mulch better and easier than using a bow rake.The handle grip is plastic and comfortable. No need to wear gloves to protect your hands when using this (although gloves are never a bad idea when gardening).I&#8217;ll give this 5 stars since, for light weeding on worked ground it performs very well, and has good build quality for the price. I would not, however, recommend this for more strenuous tasks such as breaking new ground or tilling.
B000RYOAHS I have 5 raised garden beds and used the &#34;Yard Butler RC-3 Garden Cultivator&#34; to help me get them in shape for this summer's crops.This cultivator is light weight and will only be useful for fully established gardens. I had to pull the weeds that have grown over my beds since last autumn's harvest and the Yard Butler did a good job afterward in cultivating the soil.One thing I noticed was the small roots (from both the weeds and last year's vegetables) immediately got wound-up around the wheels. However, I was able to correct this by removing the middle wheel.The wheels, when all three were in place, rolled nicely forward, but tended to get stuck/bogged down on the return motion. Again, I corrected this by removing the middle wheel. Each wheel has a little screw-knob for fast and easy removal.At the end of the day, the Yard Butler did an acceptable job for a light-duty hand-powered tool. My garden is planted and I am happy with this product.
B000RYOAHS I do a fair amount of gardening -- previously, I'd been using a ho or a shovel to till the soil before planting.  This cultivator does a much better job of breaking the soil up into smaller pieces.  The handle could be better to hold (it seems sometimes like it needs to be at more of an angle or something, to be able to jam it into the ground).  I do have very hard, clay-like soil where I live, so that may not be an issue for everyone.  Generally, this does an ok job, at a good price.
B000RYOAHS This has good use if you have a planter with soft soil but don't expect it to do much in harder dirt.  For the amount of muscle I'd have to use to get this thing to work in hard dirt, I might as well just poke it with a fork.
B000RYPZQ8 i was so excited to get this until i saw that lowes had it for less.  was kicking myself for my impatience as i had just ordered it that morning and it was already too late to cancel.  the kneeler itself is great though hard to pull the spring to fold and open it
B000RYPZQ8 WONDERFUL TO USE WITH THE SUPPORT HANDLES ON EACH SIDE AND THE PADS KEEP MY KNEES FROM HEARTING AND EASY TO LIFT MYSELF UP.
B000RYPZQ8 I can't say enough about this Garden Butler.  It is QUALITY MADE and easy to use.  The side rails fold up easily but lock in place for a secure handle that you can raise yourself up with.  The kneeling pad is made of a thick foam that absorbs the pressure when you kneel down on your knees.  Makes it easy to plant and get down to ground level.  Well made and very much worth the price.  I really can kick myself for not getting one sooner.  Anyone with knee problems will love this thing.  I recommend it.
B000RYPZQ8 I have one of these that was given to me years ago, and it is still my favorite gardening 'tool'.  The paint still looks pretty good, the hinges still work, and the cushion is still soft on my old knees.  I love that in the kneeling position, the side rails give me help in getting up.  Also, I can quickly flip it over and it's a seat for taking off my shoes or just taking a load off.  I know my green-thumb daughter will love hers.
B000RYPZQ8 I bought this kneeler when I was having serious back and knee problems, since managed with physical therapy. But I still use this whenever I'm planting or weeding in the garden. It takes a load off my knees, protects them from cuts and scrapes, and helps take the strain off my back.After three years of use and storage outdoors in my garage, one of the foam pads fell off. Considering that it lives in a plastic bin on my rear deck year round, this is not too surprising; the temperature cycling, heat, and humidity probably dissolved the original thin glue layer. I re-attached the pad with  Gorilla Glue and it's good as new again.
B000RYPZQ8 The arthritis in my feet and knees has advanced enough in the past few years that I find it difficult to get up if I have to kneel down for something. Additionally, I have a bad meniscus in my right knee that often makes it painful to put my entire weight on that leg to push myself up to a standing position unassisted.I was putting my garden last month and was excited to find this Garden Kneeler and Seat here on Amazon. Turn it one way and it is a small elevated seat. Turn it the other and it is a low kneeler. The benefit of this kneeler over those ones that are just a free-standing foam pad is that this kneeler has sturdy steel \"arms\" that you can use to push yourself up from a kneeling to a standing position. You could easily use it in the house as well, for when you drop something and need to get down to pick it up. I found it to be stable--not wobbly at all--when I was pushing myself up from the kneeler.The kneeler comes folded up and you just have to pull the legs out to open it. This took a LITTLE doing but not bad. I actually keep mine in the out position all the time now instead of folding it and unfolding it all the time. My kneeler (in the seat position) sits just inside my garage door with my garden bucket and supplies on it, so I can quickly grab them and head out to the garden.When my kneeler first arrived, I found the material used to make the seat/kneeler part of the device to be odd. It feels like a dense version of the foam you use to make flower arrangements. As such, it does not give much when you kneel on it, but there is some give. I sat on the seat when I was out in the garden last week. Since it is so narrow, it would not be comfortable for me to sit on it for an extended time (as my behind is not narrow) but it certainly was comfortable enough for me to accomplish the task at hand.My concern about this foam-type substance used in the seat is that it may be difficult to clean if it became stained.  That remains to be seen.Please note that this seat/kneeler is never to be used as a stepstool and that the weight limit is 250 pounds. The kneeler itself weights 8.5 pounds.Definitely recommended.
B000RYPZQ8 I love this garden kneeler! I've been using it for two years and the hinges are still tight and strong. I use it both ways - sitting and kneeling. I have bad knees, so sometimes I find that it's hard to get up off of the ground after weeding. The Yard Butler is very sturdy and it's the right height, so I can push myself up smoothly without any issues. I don't always kneel on it, sometimes I'm beside it, but I still make sure it's within reach to help me get up.  It folds up for storage, so it's easy to tuck away when not in use. I have it hanging in my garden shed. When I bought this one two years ago, it was to replace one that I had for many years that disappeared. I can't imagine weeding without it.
B000S61YO2 The Yard Butler Roto Planter works beautifully in soft or tilled soil for planting bulbs, herbs, tomato plant and the like.  It can be used in harder, more compacted soil, but that likely will take more effort than it is worth.  I like to use it in a tilled garden for setting plants.Watch out when using this around roots.  If you have not set the clutch on your drill to give/let loose at a certain level of torque, the Roto Planter can become locked in roots, causing the drill to twist violently and suddenly in your hands, possibly wrenching your wrist.Use this for lighter duty planting such as that described above and you will likely be very happy.
B000S61YO2 I was looking for an auger that would be wide and long enough for greenhouse posts but not require special equipment. I used this auger with my corded drill to dig holes for the posts for my greenhouse. My drill isn't special, just your typical home depot drill and it connected to it perfectly. It dug very easily through my rock-hard clay soil with each hole only taking about 20 seconds to dig.  The trick to prevent it from getting stuck is to bring it up every 4-6 inches to clear the hole from debris. This will be a keeper for all the bulb-planting I have to do in the spring.I would definitely recommend this auger.
B000S61YO2 Not sure what more to say about this. Does what it's meant to do, and does it well. My only concern is that the shaft that you put into the drill is round, and my drill is meant to hold square drill bits. I was afraid it wouldn't work, but it seemed to work just fine.
B000S61YO2 I bought this for tree fertilizing not for bulb planting. I have a 19.2 volt drill. Using this in tough conditions. But unless I flood the ground it makes almost no headway. And when I flood it, it still doesn't go down quite enough.If you intend this for fertilizing at least in clay soils, it might not work so well. I was looking forward to some deep fertilizing and unfortunately has not worked as I had hoped.
B000S61YO2 We bought 100's of bulbs last winter thinking we would get to plant them before winter hit.  However, as was the case across most of the country, winter hit hard and lasted forever.  Beginning in October the temperatures stayed in the 30's and lower and only finally got above freezing a few days in March, 2014.I was worried the bulbs might not be good any longer if I waited until this fall to plant them, so we went outside yesterday (May 1, 2014) and started the planting.  I expected it to take hours to plant all these bulbs, but with the Yard Butler it was so quick and easy.  We were done in less than 2 hours including a couple of breaks, and now I just hope the bulbs will bloom next spring.  I just won't know how successful we were until then.As far as the Roto Planter is concerned it is a super helpful garden tool.  Be sure you have a drill that will accommodate 3/8\" bits...a 1/4\" drill (which is most common) will not work.EDIT:  May 19, 2014We bought some annuals to plant in our flower garden this past weekend, petunias, marigolds, impatiens, and verbena, and because the yard butler had helped plant all the bulbs so quickly I purchased flats of 48 of each of those varieties.  Hoping this would work as well as the bulbs we went out on a Saturday morning at 9AM to begin planting 196 flowers.  Normally this would be a several hour job.  Between digging a hole with a trowel, breaking the plants apart from their containers of 4/tray, planting each one, and filling the holes with miracle-gro garden soil to replace what was displaced by the yard butler, it took us (two of us) less than 1 1/2 hours to do it all.  One of us used the butler, the other followed with the plants and covering their new home with good soil.  Now, we will wait and see one absolutely gorgeous garden in a few weeks!This is an essential garden tool!
B000S61YO2 I thought this product would help me quickly plant the hundreds of bulbs I wanted to plant, and looked forward to using it to get the depth and width holes needed for my many different bulbs.Boy was I disappointed.First, I was trying to plant many of the bulbs in soil next to perennials, many of which had great root systems.  When I tried to drill next to the plants, to plant the bulbs, I destroyed the root system.  Not good.Second, I couldn't get this roto planter to drill deeply into the clay soil we have here; the roto planter would freeze while drilling.  My HAND bulb planter worked more effectively than this product did.  It also didn't work in soil that had any small rocks in it.Third, this roto planter's shaft is difficult to secure in a drill.Overall, I think this product is great for  \"perfect\" soil, but wouldn't suggest it for anything other than rock-free, clay-free, root-free soil.
B000S61YO2 We planted about 50 bulbs in under an hour with this planter.  Our soil was relatively loose with some roots from the hostas.  We used a Panasonic 15.6 Volt drill without any issues with pop-out.  The roto planter easily dug the holes.  However, some of the loosened soil did fall back into the hole even when we reversed the drill.  So, we did need to use a small hand trowel to push out some dirt before dropping in the bulb.  We look forward to using it for weeding and planting bulbs next year.
B000S61YO2 This very easily fit into the drill bit and we were able to dig smaller holes big enough in our hard ground to be able to put up a small fence to keep the chickens in their yard. Very happy with the reduced work load.
B000S61YO2 i was very patient and practiced a lot of hole drilling with it. now i can do it real good. it works great for mixing up soil in my big nursery pots... in my compost heap... in my sandy soil.  i aerated my front yard with it using my electric corded drill and it was fun. i loosened up some potting holes for some hedge plants. it works great for me. thank you.
B000S61YO2 Buy this as opposed to the Awsome Auger in the made for TV adds.  It is strong, and not a rip off for shipping and handling.  It is a great labor saver for bulbs, annuals and loosening dirt in flower beds. Use a good cordless drill and let it do the work. Don't expect it to get thru roots.  And if the dirt is loose and dry, the dirt will tend to fall back into the hole.
B000S61YO2 My husband tried using this to dig a few holes in the yard. He said it did get a bit tangled on some roots, but if you just lifted it out you could start again. It uses the charge on the drill (battery-powered) pretty quickly. I can definitely see some uses for this, such as loosening soil in a flower bed each spring; churning the compost, digging holes if you want to plant a LOT of bulbs, etc. With that in mind, remember that you will need to store it somewhere and take the time to find it and hook it up (which probably tells you how messy our shed is). I expect we will use it sometimes (e.g., for bulbs in the fall) and just rely on old-fashioned muscle power the rest.
B000S61YO2 I have less than ideal soil and I needed a better way of digging holes than one at a time with a hand spade.I came across something like this at a local garden supply store but it was only 8\" long and dirt got all over my power drill. No local garden supply carried anything longer so I bought the 24\" version from Amazon.I used a hand file to create a triangle on the end of the bit so that the auger wouldn't slip in the drill.  With my soil, I have to use a powerful electric drill.  In the areas where I've been using good soft soil, a battery powered drill worked fine.What would have taken all day using a hand spade took only minutes.  Great tool.  Wish I knew about it a few years ago.
B000S61YO2 We have a fairly large garden and have been wanting to plant flower bulbs around it, but the idea of digging all those holes was daunting to say the least.The Yard Butler made it so much easier! It's basically a small auger, that you connect to your drill and it digs the holes for you.  It was easy to use and works really well. Recommended!
B000S61YO2 This is  a great tool and has many uses but they need to make one slight modification. In my hard soil I could not get the chuck tight enough to grip the shaft of this roto planter without slipping. I took it to the grinding wheel and ground some flats on the shaft at the end that slides into the drill chuck and that took care of any slippage. An easy enough fix but every one who buys this might not have that option available to them. Now that I took care of the slippage I am finding many uses besides the intended bulb planting. I really think it would be difficult though to dig under a sidewalk with it, as mentioned in the description. I docked it one star because I think the manufacturer should have put the flats on the shaft...not me.
B000SDKGC6 Very easy to set, just insert in tunnel and STEP on the cocking mechanism. GOT ONE THE FIRST NIGHT. The double scissors means they are caught no matter which direction. This particular mole was making it dangerous to walk without twisting an  ankle.
B000SDKGC6 Ordered this trap and was impressed with 
B000SDKGC6 This is a well designed product, strong and sturdy. It is easy to set and remove. Unfortunately in six months I haven't caught a single gopher yet. They are tearing up our lawn. I'm switching to a different product.Perhaps I'm not using these properly. The other thing is our lawn is mostly hard clay which might not be the soil in which this works best. We've found the trap tripped a couple of times but no joy. I know others have had much better luck with this model.
B000SDKGC6 Easy to set and works!  I have tried other products to get rid of the moles, poison worms, deterrent spry and granules, and other traps.  Trapping seams to be the only thing that works and these are by far the easiest I have found to use.  I've even bought a second one I like them so much.  Make sure to find and active tunnel and keep moving them if your are not getting anything.  Good Luck!
B000SDKGC6 This is hard to rate as it has never been tripped. I catch a lot of moles with a cinch type trap, but these have not worked for me. I'm sure they work, but my moles go around them. It must be too large or something, but they apparently sense it. I'm not sure.
B000SDKGC6 Maybe because the clay soil is like a rock or maybe because my moles have become highly educated but I've not snagged one mole in three weeks. I have tunnels everywhere and holes all over my yard but no dead moles. The trap seems like a good idea and it's well constructed but I don't think it's made for my area of the country. It's difficult as crud to set with the hard soil but once set it has never tripped. I've moved it to different locations but still no luck. The design seems like a good idea so maybe it'll work in your area. I'm going to keep trying and if I get positive results I will correct this review. Not recommended for clay soils.
B000SP2JLU Three years ago, at the recommendation of a friend, I bought a squirrel-resistant bird feeder (Brome 1015 Squirrel Buster Classic). It worked so well that even the heavier bully birds couldn't feed from it. I have all kinds of birds who feast from this feeder, so I decided I should get a second one. This Perky Pet feeder became available, so I was happy to give it a try. It is much cheaper than my other one, and the difference demonstrates that you do indeed get what you pay for. The squirrels figured out how to get into this one pretty quickly. So did the starlings.This feeder has a nice design, and it looks like it should work just fine. It has a spring mechanism that pulls down the plastic shell over the feeder holes when something heavy sits on one of the perches. Unfortunately, a couple of the feeder holes on this model are high enough that the squirrels just have to hang down from the top of the feeder - without putting weight on a perch - and feast away. I do have this on a tall metal shepherd's hook, so *that* deters many of the squirrels. And I have considered covering up the higher feeder holes to keep the rest of them out. I certainly wouldn't recommend hanging this from a tree or post or anything that squirrels can easily climb. Because of where I placed the feeder, most of the bird seed is actually going to the birds, but it's not because this feeder is squirrel-proof.
B000SP2JLU I've been wanting a bird feed for years, but never got one because I didn't want to lure the birds in and then have them end as cat treats.  But this little thing will keep the cats off (esp. using a shepherd's crook) and keeps the local raccons and pussoms out of the feeder!  I love watching the bird eat and flutter around the feeder.  Will buy this one again!
B000SP2JLU This is the perfect birdfeeder for my front yard.  I mounted it by hanging it from a Live Oak tree, using a \"hook\" similar to this Petco Green Bird Feeder Hanger and a thin, strong chain something like thisDroll Yankees LC18 Locking Chain.It's heavy enough when filled to hang well & the smaller birds like sparrows now get to eat more, since this is a bit small for our coveys of doves.  Occasionally, a young dove will land on top of the feeder, trying to figure out how to get some seed, only to close the doors for the other birds.  So far, the squirrel hasn't tangled with this, probably due to my precarious Rube Goldberg setup.I like the unobtrusive look of the feeder & I like that it holds enough seed for about a week of feeding (it's getting more popular; first it was 2 weeks, then a week, now about 5 days!).  It's relatively easy to fill; springs hold the lid on and can be tension adjusted for the \"right\" amount of feeder restriction if you do have a curious squirrel.  A winner!Have questions?  Leave a comment & I'll help you if I can.UPDATE 5/2/13:  Yet another advantage of this feeder is that its slim design handles windy conditions better than conventional feeders.  I live in Texas & springtime can get WINDY.  I briefly exchanged this feeder with a square one & immediately noticed strong swinging and spinning motions that were keeping the birds from perching.  Changed back to this feeder the same day & noticed how much less this feeder's affected by wind, due to its leaner profile.UPDATE 6/8/13:  A squirrel braved the Rube Goldberg setup yesterday & made it down the hook, down the chain, and onto the feeder.  Only to be TOTALLY frustrated, since his weight closed off all the feeding stations, just as promised : )
B000SP2JLU I've had this feeder for a month and really like it! I saw other reviews that say it doesn't last or doesn't work against squirrels, so I'll update this later, but so far I like it a lot.It was easy to fill and the hanger is a stiff wire, so I could reach a high hanger without it flopping over. The internal spring is adjustable, though I haven't needed to do that. There are multiple perches for birds to feed (6), and when I watched our pesky neighborhood squirrel defeated by it, I was very happy. That squirrel drives me nuts! It holds a fair amount of seed (2 lbs. according to the label), so I've only needed to refill it occasionally.
B000SP2JLU We have tons of birds AND squirrels around our house. We can open the back door and see them all over hunting for food. We've even watched them from our back door stealing dog food off the porch. Many times!! We hope the poor things don't choke on it.That said, we can't seem to attract any birds or squirrels to this thing to even test it out. I've even moved it around the yard a bit and watched from my back door. They don't even come close to it.So, I can't tell you how well it works as far as keeping the squirrels away, since I can't seem to catch anything eating or trying to eat from it.As far as looks, it's pretty. I like the way it looks in our yard. It's a little hard to fill with the way the top goes on. As long as you expect to spill some bird seed(the birds will eat it anyway), it's fine, though.
B000SP2JLU A simple yet extremely effective design for  keeping squirrels out of the wild bird seed. My only two concerns are at the two separate ends--the top does not open far enough/easily enough to effectively fill the feeder and the bottom while designed I'm certain to make cleaning it easier also makes it easy for it to be dislodged and all the seed pours out on the ground--something I discovered after a strong wind storm blew the feeder off the pole it was hung on, dropping it 4 feet to the ground. These two issues are extremely minor in comparison to the extremely attractive and effective baffle mechanism for keeping the seed away from the squirrels--if there was a way to rate this as a 4.9 out of 5 I would not hesitate. My 91 year old Father-in-law spends many hours every day at his dining room table watching the squirrels get frustrated that they can not get to the seed, no matter how hard they try. The mechanism for setting the \"weight\" allowed to gain access to the seed is extremely well designed and made--adding value. Again two very minor issues that other wise would make this an outstanding squirrel proof feeder! christina & bogie
B000SP2JLU I love this bird feeder.  I have several squirrels who constantly manage to invade my bird feeders, but not this one. The Perky-Pet Wild Bird Feeder is double sided with the interior tower made of sturdy plastic and the outer tower made of metalwork with tiny spings hooked to it. The feeder has six feeding ports with metal perches that let  birds  feed, but not the heavier squirrels. When the squirrels try to feed their weight causes the metalwork to move down and block the feeding ports. When the squirrel leaves, the spings bring the feeder back to the original position.  The feeder holds over 3 pounds of seed and the birds love it.
B000SP2JLU I love the beauty of this feeder, the birds love this feeder!  Well made with a heavy fixture and very clever spring that allows only light birds to pick out the seeds,Cardinals, Woodpeckers and the very small ones have a shot of the seeds.I used to have to fill the old feeder at least once a day!  As the birds threw out the seeds that were in their way to select that one perfect one!  Now, the birds select the perfect seed and cannot throw the rest out!I fill this feeder about once a week!Highly recommend this Perk-pet Bird Feeder. 5 stars
B000SP2JLU OUR OLD ONE FELL & BROKE BEYOND REPAIR.  COULD NOT FIND ONE AT THE USUAL RETAIL PLACES.  GOT THIS ONE FROM AMAZON AND IT IS THE SAME KIND.  WORKS WELL AND AT A FAIR PRICE.  THEY ONLY MODIFICATION I MADE ON MINE WAS TO TAKE THE CLEAR TUBE OUT AND USE CLEAR PACKING TAPE TO SEAL OFF THE TOP 4 OPENINGS.  OTHERWISE, THE BIRDS CAN EMPTY IT IN A MATTER OF HOURS.  IT WOULD BE NICE IF THE FEEDER COULD BE OFFERED WITH PLUGS.
B000SP2JLU This is a light-weight feeder with plenty of space for seeds and birds, but I'm unsure this is really squirrel proof because of the crossbars.  Others have submitted photos showing squirrels on theirs.  The top deflector isn't big enough to be squirrel proof.  Since we live in the high desert, squirrels aren't a problem for us.  (They live higher in the foothills).  Our problem is neighborhood cats!This could also use some anchoring in a strong wind, but mine is hanging right in front of my south-facing window, high above the ground where cats can't go.  This feeder is easy to fill by removing the top where the metal wire is.  The design prevents seeds from flying out.
B000SP2JLU Here's the thing... I happen to love squirrels. They are my favorite animal. I don't mind feeding them, I actually enjoy it.  What I don't like is when my birdfeeders get broken due to gluttonous squirrels perching precariously whilst pigging out.  So many of my bird feeders have been destroyed by the squirrels and so much food wasted as it falls to the ground while they hang swinging upside down trying to feed.I moved my feeders out of the trees and onto shepherd's hooks a few years ago and that has also helped to hold off the majority of my fluffy tailed friends.  This product, so far, seems to be baffling and deterring my remaining stubborn squirrels.  So far they haven't figured out how to get to the food.I have only had this feeder for a couple months but I am happy to say I have yet to see a squirrel or a chipmunk feed from this feeder. I have seen a few try, and easily give up.It has taken my birds a while to get used to this new feeder and they still prefer the other feeders I have out there, but my regulars are coming back to the new one and I see the food disappearing faster.  I am hoping to see more and more birds - less and less squirrels.It seems like a sturdy birdfeeder and I think it is priced appropriately.  I like the look and the finish and so far have no complaints.  It holds a lot of food and I would buy this feeder again and purchase it for a fellow bird lover.Cherise Everhard, April 2013
B000SP2JLU I found the PERKY-PET SQUIRREL-BE-GONE FEEDER to be somewhat of a mixed bag.  While the concept is sound - springs lower the feeder when a squirrel gets on it such that the outside feeding holes no longer line up with the inside ones - the actual application leaves a little to be desired.  Since the springs are out in the elements and are relatively small, I don't give the feeder more than one or two seasons before water, dirt, feed, and bird waste fouls up the springs causing them to rust and seize up.  Admittedly, I have only had the feeder for about 6 months and it still works as good as new (as far as I can tell), the writing is clearly on the wall.The other problem I have is when larger bids land on the feeder, such as woodpeckers or a random crow, the cage drops just as if a squirrel got on.  So far no smaller bird had its head in the feeder whole when the larger bird landed, but I can see some mini-guillotine action going on if some unlucky Nuthatch was feeding the same time as my Pileated Woodpecker came along.  Obviously that would not be good for the bird - or make me very happy.All told, I'm not sure I'm going to keep the feeder too much longer because of the issues above.  It's pretty and appears to be working well now, but the drawbacks clearly out-weigh the good points.
B000SP2JLU I have two of these things.  Once is a relatively recent purchase, the other has been in place for close to a year now.  I have mixed emotions about these feeders and have had mixed results.  It was interesting to me that other reviewers here have had very similar complaints as to the effectiveness of this feeder that I have.Overall this is a good feeder and the concept is great.  It should be noted though that almost ANY feeder that claims to be \"squirrel proof\" is stretching the facts just a bit.  Squirrels are bright animals and if there is a way of getting around all the devices we humans attempt to discourage their raiding of feeders, they will find a way.  That is a fact.  Now I will tell you that this particular feeder is better than most I have used in the past.  We have been feeding birds at this particular location for well over thirty years now and have gone through a lot of feeders; both commercial and home made.  While it is extremely difficult to count squirrels, I estimate that we have at least 30 to 40 of the little critters living on our place - we live in the woods.  We have a very large number of bird feeders...always have.Anyway, while this feeder is better than most, it does have a couple of flaws.  First, the squirrels quickly learned that if they shake the feeder seeds will eventually fall out...not a lot of seeds, but never-the-less than manage to get a share of them.  Secondly, the springs which run the squirrel proof portion of the feeder are located on the outside of the container.  They are constantly exposed to weather condition which does the springs no good what so ever.  I keep mine treated with 3 in 1 oil, applied in very small amounts which seems to help not only with the actual working mechanism, but does inhibit rust and corrosion.  I have not had the problem others have had with the varmints chewing on the holes and enlarging them as of yet.The feeder is easy to load and is attractive.  It is more effective than many like products and I will continue using them.  I don't begrudge the squirrels a meal now and then actually as I enjoy them and their antics but to be quite frank, with the cost of feed and seed these days, feeding a herd of hungry squirrels had become a bit of a financial burden.Overall I am giving this one four starts but can well understand why some have ranked it lower.Don BlankenshipThe  Ozarks
B000SP2JLU I have many styles of bird feeders all around my yard. This seemed like it would be a pretty addition; one that I thought would look lovely outside my window.  I loved the idea that it closed when something heavy landed on it. I have other feeders that do this so I thought that this would be made the same way and react to weight the same way as the others.It did NOT.  When anything heavier than a goldfinch landed on it it would close---and STAY that way.  At first I thought I just had very stupid birds - they would land on the feeder and then hop around like they were looking for a port they could eat out of.  But when I went out to see what was wrong, I saw their dilemma. They just couldn't find a port because the whole thing just closed and stayed closed.It was this way not matter how I adjusted the springs.I don't want my feathered friends to starve, so I will be taking this down right this minute.
B000SP2JLU I filled it with bird seed and hung it out in a tree where I have a couple of feeders with bird suet and three of the bird socks filled with thistle seeds.  Then I waited.  It ususally takes the birds a few weeks before they will try a new feeder, but the squirrel only waited a few days.  The squirrel that likes to frequent our bird feeders stopped by one morning and his antics as he tried to get to the bird seed made my family laugh till we cried.  He jumped on the feeder from a tree branch and he held on until it finally stopped swinging.  Then he tried coming down to an opening to get to the bird seed, but of course the opening closed.  He kept trying all the openings, but no luck.  Then, he scampered back up the tree and down the branch to the feeder and holding on to the perches at the openings (which closed from his weight) he tried shaking it back and forth.  I guess he thought he could spill it onto the ground.  That tactic didn't work either.  He still hasn't gotten any bird seed out of that feeder.  I think the birds love it as I have seen them out there eating and I have filled it up numerous times now.  The feeder keeps the squirrel from getting the bird seed and it is a lot of fun to watch!  I highly recommend this bird feeder to those who love birds and also share their yard with squirrels.
B000SP2JLU I like this feeder and it is currently hanging in my yard and has not yet been broken into by squirrels. The one comment I would make is that if you hang this too close to a bush or tree with a near-hanging branch, those crafty squirrels will reach out from the branch, grab the hanging feeder and pull it sideways without closing the feeder stations to dump the seed out on the ground. However if you position the feeder so that the only way for the squirrel to get to the feeder is to climb up and on it, then their weight will close the feeding stations and preserve the seed for birds. For a hanging feeder, this one is relatively squirrel proof--if you can hang it away from other vegetation, preferably from its own pole. Recommended.
B000SP2JLU Have always had a problem with large birds pigging out on the bird feeder that we retired several years ago.  When you are buying a 40 lb. bag of bird seed every several weeks you know it's out of control.  We miss having a feeder in our back yard....The Perky-Pet 336 has at least for now reduced seed consumption by a huge margin.  Large birds like doves etc...shut down the openings while the little ones can enjoy!  Had to adjust the springs so it would take a lighter weight to shut it down, we do not have a squirrel problem.  Bought a five lb. bag of seed at the grocery store, the feeder took less than half to fill and it's lasting like I can't believe!  The larger birds feed off the seed than falls to the ground under the feeder.  So, for us, this really provides the enjoyment of the birds while keeping bankruptcy at bay!  Hope you enjoy feeding the birds as much as we do.....I would recommend this product on our very favorable use.
B000SP2JLU The Perky-Pet 336 Squirrel-Be-Gone Wild Bird Feeder has turned out to be a great feeder. I have not seen a squirrel even come close to the seeds. The unit is easy to fill and the spring adjustment is useful also. Great product.
B000SP2JLU Squirrels are the bane of people like me who enjoy feeding their backyard birds. That's because, of course, is that if squirrels had their way they would consume far more seed than the birds.Because squirrels are very smart and crafty animals, there are epic tales of the extent human beings go to keep squirrels from getting seed from their bird feeders. My personal efforts are approaching epic. I spent lots of money, to me at least, for a bird feeder that tosses the offending squirrel into the air and unto the ground when they slide down to a perch. But the squirrels responded by simply swinging my feeder, spilling seed onto the ground, and then climb down to enjoy a meal.So Perky Pet has come up with an alternative bird feeder that might be what I need. The \"Squirrel Be Gone Wild Bird Feeder\" holds two pounds of seed and has six feeding ports. The feeder has an outer shell that slides up and down, opening and closing the ports. The default position is \"open\" so birds of any size - except eagles, hawks, black birds, doves, etc. - are free to feed at their leisure. If a squirrel or unwanted larger bird rests on the perch, the outer shell slides down slamming shut the opening to the seed.I am not mechanically inclined and cannot describe this next function properly. But it looks like the chutes by each port are designed in such a way that it will prevent spillage when the feeder swings back and forth. So this might be my solution. I am sure the Perky Pets company has very smart designers of feeders and other products; I just need actual evidence that they are smarter than squirrels. And my squirrels won't give up until a year of trying.
B000SP2JLU Update weeks later:  We didn't re-fill the feeder for several weeks, and only a few seeds remained at the bottom. Still, the birds kept flocking to this feeder (despite another one, full, about 25 yards away and similarly situated). I can't figure it out, but they really seem to love this feeder. When the other feeder is empty, there's no activity around it.Yesterday, we refilled, and man, they're going nuts! They seem to squawk a lot more at this feeder -- flying around and staking out a position, and making a whole lot of noise in the process. Again, it seems to be the same birds who frequent the other feeder but aren't so noisy. It's not really a problem; just funny how different feeders elicit different responses.Update several days later:  Still no squirrel, habitually demoralized or otherwise. But one thing I notice: Even though the birds are flocking to the feeder (mostly finches and titmice), it's hard to see them from 20 feet or so. They blend into the color of the feeder and the seeds. This might be a good thing if it thwarts the hawks known to frequent our pine tree but it does make it harder to enjoy seeing the birds.---This feeder is not as sturdy or as well-designed as our current squirrel-proof feederBrome 1015 Squirrel Buster Classic, but it's also less expensive.I'd say that this model is more appropriate for small, sheltered gardens where aesthetics and a more compact size are more important than rugged durability and functionality. (It's currently hanging in a mostly shaded area; I don't think the plastic liner would last long where our other feeder hangs, in full sun.)I see the feeder from my desk, and I've seen only one squirrel so far attempt it. It was quickly discouraged and went away.  Of course I can't attribute this to the feeder. Our squirrels might simply have been easily discouraged after too many failed attempts at the Brome feeder.
B000SP2JLU I have been watching this feeder for a few days now. The birds land on the feeder, take one beak bite out of the feeder then hop off and repeat. So the birds are using it but it seems to be slow going for them.
B000SP2JLU It took a while for the birds in our yard to \"catch on\" to how this feeder works.  But when they did, they  loved it.  Today there is light snow on the ground(not very often in Arkansas) and they are absolutely creating a \"bird mob scene\" on this feeder.  Thank goodness it holds a lot of seed and has a lot of perches.  And it's so pretty too....an extra plus.
B000SP2JLU I feel horrible about watching squirrels slip off of the Perky-Pet Squirrel-Be-Gone Wild Bird Feeder.  The handle is flimsy so I hold my breath each time a squirrel pounces on the feeder.  The reason I rated the feeder at a 4 is due to the fact that blackbirds are not deterred.  If anyone knows of a blackbird AND squirrel-proof feeder, please let me know!
B000SP2JLU The Squirrel-Be-Gone Bird feeder is a creative solution to an annoying problem, but unfortunately our squirrels seem to be smarter then Perky-Pet's designers.Prior to this feeder the only method we found to keep the squirrels out of our bird feeders were large plastic dome coverings. We put this feeder out without a dome, and for about a week the squirrels were stumped; they hung on the feeder, the metalwork shifted down, and they couldn't get any food. (Luckily, during that time they didn't try to chew out the plastic, as some other reviewers experienced.) However, they soon figured out that if they hung from the wire suspending the feeder, the metalwork wouldn't shift and cover the openings, and they could eat. We also had one small squirrel who figured out how to sit on the bottom ledge without pulling down on the metalwork. Squirrel party time! So, the dome returned, and now this is just a large and fancy looking feeder.The feeder is large, and wide instead of especially long. It holds 3+ lbs of feed, something to consider if you might have trouble lifting it overhead. It seems well-made; it stood up well to the week or two of abuse from the squirrels, and a variety of birds, from cardinals to starlings (unfortunately) have been using it since. It has only been up for a few weeks, but during that time it has both snowed and rained, and we haven't had any immediate problems with rusting or leaking, however time is really the test on that front.Overall, this is an attractive feeder with multiple perches, and is quite large. Whether the squirrel-proofing will work for you seems highly dependent on your local squirrel population.
B000SP2JLU I am a life-long avid bird feeder and I'm in the heartland of the country so I feed in all weather conditions. I also have to find a way to feed seed to birds without bankrupting myself feeding squirrels and deer or replacing flimsy feeders every year. Having said that, here's my review of this feeder:Pros:* It's pretty. And that's not utterly unimportant, as anyone who loves her garden would rather have a pretty feeder than an ugly one.* It holds a reasonable amount of seed.* Because of the design of the feeder holes, the seed doesn't spill much as it's being filled or moved.* The birds took to it immediately. Of course, as my yard is what my husband refers to as the \"All You Can Eat Bird Stuff-a-thon,\" they know the location of my feeders and so didn't need to \"find\" it.* It does, in fact, appear to be squirrel resistant. I hung it on a shepherd's hook without a squirrel baffle and only about 3 feet off the ground (thus, I did not need a neon sign that said, \"Squirrel Food Here!\")  And the next day saw two fat-tailed friends (and a chipmunk) on the ground under the feeder (Why they were finding much seed there will be explained under \"Cons.\") Had the feeder not been squirrel resistant, I assure you my little furry buddies would NOT have been on the ground!Cons:* The innards seem flimsy. The spring that makes the squirrel resistant closing mechanism work is small and seems not terribly sturdy. And it's  _inside_ the feeder, which is going to make cleaning the feeder problematic and, I think, will make the spring mechanism vulnerable.* It's not terribly easy to fill as it definitely requires two hands - one to hold the lid aside (resisted by the spring) and one to pour. (I also note that this took me a bit of figuring out as there is nothing in the directions that tells you how to fill it.)* While it does appear to be squirrel-resistant it is NOT deer resistant so, if your bird feeders are right next to a deer superhighway as mine are, they will get their tongues in the feeder holes and will empty this baby in very short order! And while they are at it, a lot of your seed will end up on the ground under the feeder where the squirrels will get it anyway.Having said that, if deer aren't a problem in your neighborhood, then you might not find this a \"con.\" (The only truly deer-resistent seed feeder style I have found is also by Perky Pet - and this is just one example; they have several styles:No/No Bronze Hourglass Bird Feeder  BZHG00325) However, without a squirrel baffle on your feeder pole, you'll be back to square one with those little beasties. So, if you get a squirrel baffle and a deer-proof feeder, you'll have spent a bit more, but will save a fortune over the long-haul in seed (and destroyed feeders!)Woodlink Ltd-Woodlink Audubon 6-Inch Torpedo Steel Squirrel Baffle.Conclusion: If you are a sometimes, only-casual bird hostess who doesn't want to spend a fortune on a squirrel resistant feeder, you may like this. If you are at all serious about your birdie buffet, this may not be the best choice.
B000SP2JLU A lot of \"solutions\" for bird feed loving squirrels are either ugly, ineffective, or both. This feeder hits a nice compromise of being both attractive and effective for discouraging squirrels. It is sturdy and well built and holds a good amount of feed. A good choice.
B000SP2JLU As with all squirrels ours are pretty darn resourceful. We have tried several different approaches. We have tried the urine scented tablets and granules without any success. and various different types of feeders with varying degrees of success. So far this one is actually working. the spring loaded cage that covers the feed holes when to much weight on them is a good idea and has worked perfectly so far. The only issue I have with this is that the springs get in the way of filling the feeder. Only time will tell how long the springs will last.I received this product free of charge to try through the vine program.Would I spend my own money on this? Yes
B000SP2JLU Considering this is a 20.00 birdfeeder made in China it seems to be OK. Obviously the construction is low end, but the birds are finally eating out of it. It took them almost a month to use it which is very unusual for a bird feeder here in the winter. Have not seen any squirrels attempt an invasion yet and I hope they don't as I doubt this will hold up to many heavy attacks. Very decorative. This would be a nice bird feeder for an in town situation. Not too sure how well it will do here in the country.
B000SP2JLU [Please see the update at the end of this review]I'm an avid backyard bird watcher, so I've had considerable experience with various types of feeders (including those meant to dissuade squirrels).  The PERKY-PET 336 SQUIRREL-BE-GONE feeder is much less expensive than some of the ones I've tried, so I was intrigued.  If it works, it will be a real find.The feeder arrived in one piece -- no need to do any assembly (that's a very positive thing -- anything that works right out of the box is great by me!).  It consists of a slender plastic tube to hold seed, surrounded by wire and metal leaves designed to prevent squirrels from reaching the plastic.  There are six perches for birds, with feeding ports that will close up if a squirrel (or a heavy bird) tries to access them.  The mechanism is controlled by a small spring, which can be adjusted to allow or deny larger birds access -- squirrels shouldn't be able to get to the food no matter how the spring is set.Well, I've had it up for about a week now, and so far the squirrels aren't interested in it -- but neither are the birds!  I watched a few birds circle it during the first few days, but they invariably went to one of my other feeders.  One did try one of the perches, but then immediately flew off.  It's possible the thing just looks strange to them, and they prefer the feeders they're used to.  But this is the first time I've put out a new feeder and had no takers after this long a time.So far, after a week of use, here's how things stand:POSITIVES:1)  Low price for a squirrel-proof feeder -- can't beat that2)  Arrives fully assembled3)  Attractive, slim design -- looks nice hanging out on my deck4)  Squirrels don't seem interested in it (so far!)NEGATIVES:1)  Very small feeding tube, holds only 2 pounds of seed -- if my birds start flocking to it, I'll be filling it every day!2)  Thin plastic feeding tube doesn't look like it will last very long, even if the squirrels do leave it alone3)  Spring that controls the squirrel-proof mechanism is very small, and it's located on the outside of the feeder, meaning it's likely to rust or otherwise deteriorate -- if it breaks, the feeder will be inoperative4)  Perches aren't large enough for cardinals to feed comfortably -- they prefer a feeding tray (if you're more interested in finches, this feeder should work)I will certainly update this review if things change over time.  At this point, I can't say this is a winner.  As for what HAS worked for deterring squirrels, the only thing I can swear by isF.M. Brown's Bird Lover's Blend No Squirrel Just Birds, 7-1/2-Poundbird seed, which contains hot pepper.  It totally keeps the squirrels away, and the birds don't seem to even notice the pepper.  It's expensive though, so if this feeder ends up working with my birds, I'll be happy.  We'll see.UPDATE 3/12/2013:  I decided to let my other backyard feeders run dry, just to see if the birds would start feeding at the PERKY-PET.  Sure enough, once the other feeders were empty, smaller birds began to give the new feeder a try.  I re-filled the other feeders (so the cardinals and other larger birds could feed comfortably), and the finches, sparrows, and nuthatches are still frequenting the PERKY-PET.  So, I guess it just takes time.I still think the small seed capacity is a detraction from the feeder, as is the lack of a feeding tray for cardinals.  But birds -- even in Maryland -- will get used to the PERKY-PET.
B000SP2JLU I had this same bird feeder many years ago.  It deteriorated with age (springs went bad) and squirrels eventually chewed the interior plastic up.  Why then would I get another?It's attractive, holds quite a bit of seed and doesn't allow \"junk birds\" (grackles, starlings, etc) easy access.  Is it squirrel-proof?  Absolutely not, but that type feeder just doesn't seem to exist, even though so many (including this one) advertise themselves as such.  One or two squirrels may not present a problem, but avid bird feeders or those who live in settings with large squirrel populations know just what I'm talking about.For the past few years, I've taken a different approach.  It's not the feeder that's the problem, it's the squirrel.  Expensive baffles now surround all our feeders and squirrel populations gets thinned out periodically.  We have gray, black, red, flying and fox squirrels, and they're all Harry Houdinis.This time around, I'm not giving the Squirrel-Be-Gone feeder a chance to get squirrel tested.  It hangs from an unused basketball hoop, and is used exclusively by smaller birds, although I can attest it is not their favorite feeder in our large yard.  Next to it hangs a cheap platform feeder, used by a variety of birds.  Next to that hangs a small peanut dish, which is actually the most popular of all three.  Even Red-bellied Woodpeckers love peanut halves.  The whole set-up looks tacky, but hooray, no squirrel can reach any of them.The Squirrel-Be-Gone bird feeder definitely does not live up to its name, but if used creatively, it's an inexpensive feeder (especially if found on sale) that does keep out seed-hogging big birds.  I just hope the springs last longer than the first one we had, and maybe an occasional lubing will help.
B000SP2JLU I have been feeding birds (and thus squirrels) for a long time. I've had all kinds of feeders, and I have come to respect squirrel ingenuity. They are geniuses at figuring out a feeder's design flaw and getting what they want.Still, this is a nice addition to my feeder collection, and so far I've only seen birds feeding from it. I'm not, however, so naive to think it will always be like this. While the feeder is attractive, I can already see that squirrels will probably solve this temporary puzzle. Perhaps a better name for this might have been Perky-Pet Squirrel Deterrent (At least for a while) Wild Bird Feeder.
B000SP2JLU I like the look of the feeder.  It's attractive, and I really love that it holds over 3 lbs of seed.  It was good for about a week and a half.  After that, the squirrels chewed at the plastic, just making the seed openings larger, and the springs stopped working consistently.  The idea is great, the execution just needs a bit of work.  Our dog, however, was overjoyed, as it became the popular neighborhood bar for the squirrels.  He loves chasing them and got a good workout daily.  Made the dog and squirrels happy, the birds were less than enthused.
B000SP2JLU I have a few bird feeders in our yard, ranging from a hanging umbrella-top thing with a pan bottom and a simple plate on top of a stand, but when squirrels take over, and they often do, the birds get bullied out of needed feed. Weeelllll...Perky-Pet is a long (somewhat over 2 ft) plastic tube feeder. It holds 2 lbs of seed and each perch is a U shape, supposedly the kind birds prefer (who knew?). So, squirrel tried to nail it from above, but the surface is slippery... and it bounces.  Entertainment at an affordable price while feeding the birds that civilized people prefer.UPDATE: This is THE lure for birds in our neighborhood now. It does hold a LOT of seed, and they now flock and eat it up in a few days... much faster than before, so expect to keep refilling weekly. But oh, how cool!
B000SP2JLU I had a lot of success with the previous Perky Pet bird feeder I requested from Vine. During the fall migration, we had a lot more feathered visitors than usual--and by \"more\" I mean both in terms of sheer numbers and variety of species. Since we also have a high squirrel population (cute, interesting, ubiquitous and greedy) I thought the Squirrel-Be-Gone (SBG) would be a perfect addition to the yard.So, because we didn't have an extra feeder hanger when the SBG arrived, we took down the reliable feeder and replaced it with this.  In the meantime, I bought food that was a much better quality than the generic stuff we'd been using, hoping to reduce the waste.The SBG hung for DAYS and remained full.  Occasionally a sparrow would hop on one of the little perches and then fly away. We couldn't figure it out. Did they not like the feeder openings? Did they prefer the cheaper food? Maybe the cheap seed was the equivalent of fast food, and they were \"junk-food junkie\" birds.A squirrel did jump onto the shepherd's hook hanger and try to access the food, but after bouncing around for a few minutes he left in frustration.  So, the SBG does discourage Shadow-Tails.Then, we installed another hanger and filled our original feeder, and the birds rediscovered our yard. The feeder emptied within hours. So, they obviously liked the food.The full SBG hung there, still full, still ignored.Eventually, though, maybe out of desperation, the birds started to sample seed from the SBG. Mainly house sparrows, but you have to start somewhere. Maybe they'll spread the word that poking their heads into the little feeder openings will not get them guillotined.We have seen nowhere near the enthusiasm our original feeder triggered. But now that spring migration has started, along with a cold front, it will be interesting to see if we get more avian traffic.Perky Pet is a good company. Both feeders are well-made and attractive. The Squirrel-Be-Gone is easy to set up and adjust so that birds can get the food and squirrels can't. It's also easy to fill and clean.I am still not sure why it's taking so long for this feeder to become a hit with the birds. But if they start mobbing the feeder, I will post an update.
B000SP2JLU I received this bird feeder one day before we got a snowstorm, so we had cause to put it in the yard immediately. Almost as soon as it went into the yard it quickly became the most popular feeder in the yard. Weathering the storm the next day really showed this feeder's strengths.This feeder is marketed as a squirrel-proof feeder. It's not, exactly - too much plastic instead of metal so a squirrel can gnaw through it in time. I would call this feeder more \"squirrel-resistant\". That said, being squirrel-resistant is actually not this feeder's strength though it is a big positive. The way this feeder's anti-squirrel strategy is implemented is by spring-mounting the wire sheath on which the feeding ports are mounted. When a squirrel gets on the feeder, its own weight works against it and the wire sheath slides down, closing the feeding ports. It does work, though the enterprising squirrel may find ways around this depending on how the feeder is hung.Adjusting the sensitivity of the sliding mechanism is easy. The springs that control the tension can be moved to increase or decrease the tension with one hand in about 5 seconds (if you're slow). This is nice - it does not require disassembly or special tools.Though this is a squirrel-deterrent feeder, that is not where this feeder's strengths lie. This feeder has two very good features that make it better than a lot of other feeders of its type.First, this feeder has six feeding ports, and each has a short perch that is suitable for small songbirds and very awkward for larger birds like grackles. We have more troubles with grackles than squirrels and as such this feeder is already doing well in comparison to the other feeders we own. Second - and this is very important - the feeding ports are designed to avoid giving up all of the seed in heavy wind. In the middle of a storm, it is not unusual to see all of the seed blown out of a feeder in a short period of time, requiring more frequent refills.The biggest evidence that this feeder is well-designed is how it attracts the songbirds. This is by far the busiest feeder in the yard now. With no squirrels or grackles chasing off the other birds and no wind blowing all of the seed out on the ground, this is a feeder that allows us to watch birds instead of continuously refilling the feeder.I am very pleased with this feeder and heartily recommend it. With this feeder in the yard, you will spend more time birdwatching and less time maintaining the feeder.
B000SP2JLU Although I purchased this feeder at a local Ace Hardware store several weeks ago, I stopped putting seed in it... I was only feeding the squirrels.  Apparently, here in Florida, the squirrels must be too light-weight to close the feeder, (I've taken several photos), and the birds (Blue Jays and Cardinals) are too large to stand on the very small perches and bend their heads into the cups... it's too difficult for larger birds and they fly off.  It would probably work well in an area where little Finches flock!
B000SP2JLU The funny thing about this birdfeeder is that out of the 5 I have in my yard, this is the only one that still has birdseed in it after a week.Now I can't tell if its because the squirrels can't get to it or because the birds don't particularly enjoy it either, but it works to keep seed in there longer!I have seen it in action, the squirrels try to hang off it and eat but cannot. We have it on a shepherd's hook so there is nothing else for them to hold on to while eating. I have also witnesses some pretty big birds on it, too, eating without a problem.The birdfeeder itself is fairly light. The metal is thin and the inside is made of plastic. My only concern is the squirrels who get desperate enough might gnaw at the plastic and render it useless as a deterrent.It is super easy to fill and while the rubber hanger seems fragile, it has held up in plenty of storms and birds, so I suppose its good.
B000SP2JLU I got the bird feeder on a whim thinking it would be a fun addition to the yard.  However, I have to say that the design is a bit clunky and not very eye-pleasing.  We haven't had many visitors to the feeder...just wondering if it might be the time of year or our location.  It's a great idea and it's constructed very well, but like I said, the look of it is a bit mechanical to me.  If you have a tree/bush/or garden area to place this within, it would work great.
B000SP2JLU This feed is very nice looking and it is designed to keep squirrels away from your feed by closing the access doors due to the weight of the squirrel. Unfortunately, all my birds are avoiding this feeder for some reason. I have filled my other feeders twice and they have not taken the feed in this one down by a quarter. I have watched them looking for a reason, even let the other feeder go empty for a bit giving them no other option, but aside from a few sparrows, the other birds won't even land on this one.I don't know why?
B000SP2JLU My biggest problem is that of squirrels and large birds infesting my bird feeder. I have heard mixed reviews about squirrel proof feeders, so I thought I would give this a try. I adjusted the tension to prevent squirrels from entering. Thus far it appears to be working; however, some of the larger birds are still able to access the food. I may need to adjust it a little more. I will provide updated posts on this as well once Spring arrives. In any case it is a nice larger feeder that looks nice and is easy to manage.
B000SP2JLU I was surprised by how light this birdfeeder felt. It seems that the inner part is made of lightweight plastic which it first has me concerned because I've never seen a squirrel be detoured effectively by plastic.  The idea is, you fill the center part with bird seed. As the birds come to feed they rest on the metal bars just above the leaf design. Because they are lightweight the birds do not affect the position of the LEAVES, which if you haven't figured it out, act as barriers to the openings.  Therefore, when a squirrel comes a calling, their weight, pulls the \"cage part\" down so that the leaves cover the openings. Pretty ingenious. It also has kept away the sometimes pesky Magpie birds that often try to dominate the feeders.You have to place in a way where the squirrels can't hang from it and chew through the plastic, of course, if they're hungry enough, NOTHING can stop a Squirrel from getting through. The feeder is attractive and if you can take the time to fiddle with the loading of the seed and giving it a drop of oil every now and again, it could serve you well.  It's hard to beat that price (it was just under $20) for a feeder that could be an moderate squirrel deterrent, it's not bad.  Some people have reported having this one for 6 years, and that is pretty impressive. I suspect our squirrels have bigger teeth!  But the Birds love the support and it's worth the extra effort for that alone!
B000SP2JLU I would have rated this feeder a \"0\" or - 1 star if available. I bought this feeder about 9 months ago and should have taken it back then. The birds liked it at first, then stopped feeding from it even though it was 3/4 full of seeds. When I took it down, I saw that the remaining 3/4 of the seed were wet and matted together in a moldy \"brick\". It took about one hour to \"clean\" it and clean up the mess in my kitchen. Neither the lid nor the base is removable for cleaning, so there's no way to remove and clean the seeds from half way down to the bottom. To prevent the squirrels getting the lid off, it's designed to pull up a little way and tilt to the side for adding seed.If you turn the feeder upside down to shake out the old seeds, the lid (spring mechanism) pops back in place. That doesn't really matter because the seeds are wet and compacted into a brick anyway. I had to push a 13\" screwdriver into each port and try to loosen the seeds while running hot water through the top (cold water didn't work). I must have used 10 gallons or more of hot water and ran the garbage disposer the entire time I was attempting to clean this horrible \"feeder\". I bet it cost me $5 to clean the feeder.It's impossible to reach downward with a screwdriver to force the seeds loose, and you can't clean it because you can't get a brush in vertically. It's a HORRIBLE design. Once I flushed and poked most of the seeds out, I soaked the feeder in a big bucket of soapy water, then flushed it again. I still did not get out all the old moldy seeds.Since I could not get inside to dry it, I had to set the feeder on the floor near a heat register for THREE DAYS to dry it out. The birds left my yard and it took a couple weeks before they came back.After all that work, I decided that the wet seeds must have been a fluke -- perhaps the result of a heavy sideways rain or snow. So instead of returning the \"feeder\", I filled it again. Duh!! Within a week, the same thing happened. I took it down.It's been 9 months since I bought it, but I'm returning it to Lowe's tomorrow.This bird feeder is readily available for $19.99 at ANY big box store, yet online stores still try to sell it for much more. This feeder isn't worth 50 cents EXCEPT...for the fun of watching the squirrels try to get the seed. They cannot, and after less than a week, they gave up and went away. After that, I couldn't even use the feeder for fun.Buy a Brome feeder, and buy a 16-18\" diameter clear dome to hang over the top. It protects the birds from the weather while they eat. Of all the feeders in my yard, birds prefer the one with the dome. 10\" and 12\" domes don't protect the birds or the ports.UPDATE:  I never complained to Woodstream Corp. about this feeder. However, Woodstream saw my review and a Customer Rep. sent me the nicest letter! She said \"Your comments concerning the design and experience cleaning this model feeder have been shared with our product development team.\" I believe Woodstream genuinely cares about customers and making good products. To make up for my inconvenience with the Perky-Pet 336 Squirrel-Be-Gone Wild Bird Feeder, Woodstream sent me a Perky-Pet 337 Squirrel-Be-Gone Wild Bird Feeder as a replacement. It has three tubes so I can use 3 different kinds of seeds, and the lid comes off by unscrewing a large knob on top. Much easier! I didn't like the Perky-Pet 336 Squirrel-Be-Gone Wild Bird Feeder, but I LOVE Customer Service at Woodstream Corp.!! It's top notch--more than a 5-star rating. THANK YOU, Woodstream.
B000SP2JLU We have had this birdfeeder for many years and had great luck with it, so I just ordered another.  It absolutely does work to deter squirrels.  All birds seem to enjoy the feeder, including our larger woodpeckers.The downside of this feeder is also the upside.  The squirrel-busting mechanism for this feeder is the wire external structure, which is mounted on adjustable springs.  When a squirrel attempts to grip or jump on the feeder its weight automatically pulls the metal part down, closing off access to the bird food.  It is 100% foolproof.On the downside, I have read reports of small birds having their heads guillotined if they are feeding when a heavy bird or squirrel lands on the feeder.  I have never seen that happen, but I did at one time find the head of a small bird near the feeder.  That possibility really unnerved me.  Right now I have my feeder set to be as unresponsive as possible to weight, so that only a squirrel will close it (so it does not close for woodpeckers, starlings, etc.).  I also have it mounted in such a way that squirrels are unlikely to be able to reach it.  I am comfortable using the feeder with those caveats, but I do think the rapid closure and deep feeding holes could create a dangerous situation for small birds.
B000SP2JLU We have a feed tray outside that a squirrel is always getting into, then kicking off of (leaving the tray swinging/smashing into our window), so we're eager to give this a full test this season. The design looks solid and feasibly squirrel proof, so we can't wait!
B000SP2JLU I already had a bird feeder when I got this, so this is feeder #2. The first one is quite different in style.Here's the linkfor the first feeder (for comparison). When I added the new feeder, I filled both feeders. The birds completely ignored the new one while they emptied the original. However, once the original was empty, they discovered the new one and seemed to have no problems with it.Here are the positives for the new one:(1) It's fairly sturdy.(2) Small birds have no problem using it.(3) There was minimal spilling when I filled it.(4) The birds do not empty it as quickly as they do the first one, so the seed in it lasts longer.Here are the negatives:(1) It comes with minimal directions and no directions for filling. As best I can tell, to fill it, you pull off the top (easy enough) and push it to the side. However, as the top is attached to a spring, it tends to snap back. Keeping the top open is not easy, though I finally figured out to hook the top over the corner of the eave.(2) Because the perches are small, larger birds may not be able to use the feeder. I have doves that come by, but I have not seen them on the feeder. Typically, they sit on the ground anyway and eat the seed that the smaller birds spill.I'll keep using this feeder, but I'll keep the other one out too.
B000SP2JLU The huge blackbirds cannot steal from this one.  I feed big birds and even squirrels, but needed a feeder that the finches and smaller birds could utilize.  This is it, and I love it.  It is also very attractive.
B000SP2JLU Over the years I have tried several squirrel-proof bird feeders but to no avail. Chipmunks and baby squirrels can still go at it, especially in spring. These small critters appear from nowhere and go at my birdfeeders faster than humans can outsmart them.The design of this feeder is unique and built sturdily. It has six feeding ports with U-shaped perches and the feeding ports have sturdy metal to prevent squirrels from chewing the ports. When squirrels perch on them, their weight causes the entire metal casing to slip down, completely blocking the feeding ports and the seed. The adjustable weight activated springs allows me to change to any of the four different tensions, giving me the ability to choose what size bird I want at my bird feeder. Currently I have adjusted to the lowest tension allowing only small birds like sparrows can use them. After few weeks, if chipmunks can't get at it, then I will raise the tension level to two so that slightly larger birds can get at it. I have been using this for the past two weeks and so far it appears to be working.With regards to the durability, I don't know if the weather, in the long run, has deleterious effect on the materials of this feeder mainly from sun, heat and rain. If something comes up, then I will update this review.1.Perky-Pet 337 Squirrel-Be-Gone III Wild Bird Feeder2.Birdscapes 735 The Preserve Wild Bird Feeder3.Birdscapes 351 Squirrel-Be-Gone II Wild Bird Feeder4.Heritage Farms Squirrel Proof Bird Feeder5.Contech SquirrelStop Automatic Spinning Squirrel Deterrent
B000SP2JLU I like the capacity of this feeder and the number of feeding holes it has.  It is easy to fill, I use a wide mouth funnel and a small coffee can.  The spring loaded sides shuts off the feeding holes when squires or large birds try to feed.  I have purchased three before this one. The only problem I have had with the older one is that the springs corrode and stop working, then I just put a wedge to keep the holes open.Rain does work it way into the feeder holes and once a year I have to take the bottom off the feeder and clean it out.  Small birds lover this feeder.
B000SP2JLU This is a nice looking squirrel &#34;proof&#34; feeder. It is on the large side so ensure you have room for it.
B000SP2JLU PLEASE READ UPDATE AT BOTTOM DATED 5-2-13I have resident squirrels that love the bird feed - and many bird lovers can confirm that we come near to ripping out hair when the grey rodents take over the eating stations, we'll do nothing short of standing guard w/ guns to keep them away!Anyway - the squirrel has yet to breach this one.  It works well and the springs on the side are adjustable but I have to mention that it seems a bit flimsy and doesn't look as nice in person as in the photo.  The inner sleeve that holds the feed is plastic but it's grey and not \"new\" looking.I have this hanging next to a BROME squirrel buster feeder.  The birds congregate around the Brome feeder first and when empty, they will venture to this one.Two things - I think it's harder for the birds to get the feed from this Perky-Pet feeder HOWEVER the plus side ---- there is not an abundance on the ground under the feeder either.  My original squirrel buster is the favorite feeding station but guess what???  There's seed all over the ground under the feeder.I suppose, if I had to make a choice, I would go with the Brome squirrel buster feeder.  While I go through feed rather quickly - the spread on the ground allows tons of birds to eat AT the feeder and UNDER the feeder at one time so it's quite the site.The original is Brome 1015 Squirrel Buster Classic and retails (with PRIME) for approx. $50.  I can say that is what my daughter paid for mine at the local Agway store too so Amazon's price is comparable.The PERKY PET Squirel-Be-Gone retails for about $20 (with PRIME)but as I said, the PP feeder doesnt' seem to be as durable or sturdy as the more expensive Brome.  Birds do not know the difference between the cost but I don't know that the PP feeder is going to last more than a year or two...where the Brome is going on 2 years and holding tight.There's more to consider.  Come fall we have a big bear that loves to rip the suet and feeders down, destroying everything in its path.  So do I want expensive feeders in hope to remove them before the bears' surprise visits or do I want cheaper feeders that I won't be sick when I wake in the morn to find them torn up???  These are the things to keep in mind when purchasing.  Currently the Brome and the Perky Pet are keeping the squirrels at bay, so you choose how much money you want to invest.I know this review is back and forth - but consider everything and in the end, throwing feed out the door will bring in the birds and spread far enough that both the squirrels and the birds can eat with no competition!  Have a great day !5-2-13 -- BEAR came this Spring.  There's a 3 wk time frame from when their hibernation ends and the berries are ready to eat so they come calling for seed and suet.  Well I'm sick of them. As for the feeders - the BROME came through without a problem.  This Perky Pet feeder snapped like a dead stick.  Springs were sticking out all over like hair gone wild and the inner sheath was out and empty.  Oh yeah and the solid metal stake was twisted like a curly fry.  Anyway - the Perky Pet feeder did keep out the squirrels for the time we had it but now, it's no more cuz it couldn't last the bear beating it took.
B000SP2JLU Well, although it works like its supposed to (so far) when a squirrel climbs on it, the squirrels jump on it to swing it and when they jump off, the spring loaded gizmo pops back into place and seed falls to the ground, giving the squirrels what they want.You also need to hang this up much higher as its on the long side and some squirrels jump from the ground and climb up it. I also don't fill the feeder to the top because its way too heavy and the way i have it hung really droops the rope making it hang too low.As for the construction of the feeder, its just a matter of time before either the springs rust and don't slide up and down anymore or the tiny pins the springs click into will fail. Even when this happens its still a nice large feeder that plenty of birds can share. I honestly do not think that there is anything out there that truly keeps the squirrels away.
B000SP2JLU The Squirrel-Be-Gone lives up to its billing of resisting the actions of squirrels while still allowing small birds to enjoy the seed contained within.We have well over a dozen squirrels in the area that have become experts at defeating most all of the measures I have taken over the years to prevent them from devouring every sunflower seed I put out. Powdered red pepper works with limited effectiveness, but I've found that some of them have a taste for spicy things.Baffles and oversized pole covers only slow them down, and the only thing that works without fail is to use safflower seed instead of sunflower. However, some birds still like variety and offering a variety of seed increases the number and variety of birds that visit the feeders. This feeder seemed to be the answer to that need.Right out of the box, this is an attractive feeder. The bronze color and the leaf motif makes it a nice addition to any backyard, or front yard for that matter. The seed hopper is clear, so you can see how much seed is left quite easily. The feeder is suspended from a coated wire, which should hold up to the elements well, and might even sustain attempts by squirrels to chew through it in order to dump the feeder. The proofing part of this feeder comes from the wire and leaf outer portion of the feeder that is spring-loaded.During normal use, birds are able to land on the U-shaped perches and eat from the cutouts in the seed hopper. When a heavy animal tries to access the seed, its weight loads down the spring-loaded portion, which then covers the cutouts, blocking access to the seed. See the photos I have posted for visual reference of each kind of activity.I have to say, watching squirrels get denied is just as enjoyable as watching the birds at the feeder!With only a few weeks of use, there's no way yet to know how the feeder will hold up to normal use as well as the continued attempts by animals to get at the seed. While squirrels have been denied, raccoons can be more motivated. The effects of weather can also take a toll on plastics and metals alike, so time will tell and so will I if there is anything more to report at a later time.
B000SP2JLU It really works!  We have about a dozen or so different types of bird feeders, and had pretty much given up on trying to keep squirrels out of the seed.  The buggers would hang from their hind legs upside-down on the fence so they could reach in and steal bird seed from the feeders.Don't get me wrong. I have nothing against squirrels. We even put seed corn cobs out for them to eat.  They are cute little critters and fun to watch, so long as they aren't destroying something I own.  But I got tired of having to replace bird seed in my feeders every few days because the squirrels were feasting on it at will.Well, it's not working for the squirrels anymore!  The moment anything puts the slightest amount of weight on the metal frame around the outside of this feeder, it pulls down and closes off the holes, making the contents inaccessible. Within a day we noticed the squirrels weren't trying to hang upside- down anymore from the fence, and they have resorted to foraging on the ground below the feeders to get seed. Success!There are other nice features about this feeder also such as the small vent holes at the bottom, which allow water to run out of the seed tube.  The bottom is angled up in the middle to prevent water from pooling at the bottom, causing seeds to rot or grow/ferment.  The top lifts up for easy filling.Another bonus is that the tension can be adjusted on the spring that allows the \"cage\" around the outside to move up and down.  By adjusting where it hooks, you can adjust the tension some.The birds are happy, the squirrels may not be as happy anymore, but my pocketbook is happy to know that the money we spend on seed is going for actual birds, not just squirrels and other critters.
B000SP2JLU I received this bird feeder for free to review from the Amazon Vine program.  A house in our neighborhood has this same feeder hanging out on a tree in their front yard.  It looked very attractive whenever we would walk by and always has lots of birds feeding from it.  I was happy to be able to have the same feeder on our yard.  We hung it up in the back yard and so far it has indeed been squirrel proof.  Mechanically this feeder has weighted springs that shut the feeding windows when anything heavier than a bird tries to eat the food.  In our yard this design seemed unnecessarily complex.  The wire handle is too thin and slippery for the squirrels to climb down, which prevents them from getting at the food, though they have certainly tried. It actually seems kind of mean having all this free food out there where the squirrels can see it but not reach it. I think if you wanted a squirrel proof feeder for less money you could just buy a less complex design and hang it from a thin wire the squirrels could not climb down and it would be just as squirrel proof. But all in all, this feeder is very attractive and makes a nice additional to our back yard.
B000SP2JLU Construction is pretty flimsy, and I don't know how long it will last in the elements, but I didn't expect much for such a low price. The tension on the anti-squirrel system is easy to adjust, and it does seem to deter the squirrels somewhat. The squirrels now hang from the branch the feeder hangs on and get the seed that way. I may try adding some wire to move the feeder away from the branch. Cleaning is a little more difficult than some of my other feeders because of the greater number of parts. Ease of filling is about average, similar to other cheap feeders that I have. Overall, worth the money, but there are higher quality feeders out there for only a modest increase in price.
B000SP2JLU This arrived decently packed and intact despite some delicate parts.  The feeder has a brass finish but is made out of very lightweight materials - it looks good from a distance but the lack of quality is apparent once you have it up close.We have VERY smart squirrels in our area - and they are quite territorial and eager to feast on the bird feeder seeds.  In fact, they feast on everything - from Halloween pumpkins to anything we try to put in the garden.  Nothing survives our plague of squirrels.I was skeptical of this feeder due to it having a plastic barrier.  The squirrels here chew through everything so plastic isn't going to stop them (as I found with my garden vegetables and various covers I used to protect the veggies).  So I know this isn't going to last very long as a bird feeder.  On the plus side, perhaps the seeds will keep the squirrels out of the vegetables (and not eat my son's halloween pumpkin before it even gets to be used for halloween).Interesting concept but needs a little more development.
B000SP2JLU So far, I am pleased with my Perky-Pet 336 Squirrel-Be-Gone Wild Bird Feeder.  It's attractive leaf motif matches all of my exterior lighting.  The spring-loaded product design which 'closes off' the feeding holes from the weight of a squirrel is clever.  So far, I have not had an issue with a squirrel robbing the feeder.  The birds seem to enjoy the feeder.  In the week since it was hung, I have noticed a definite increase in bird activity.  Overall, I am pleased with the product.
B000SP2JLU I always get compliments on this bird feeder and it is quite pretty where I have it hanging. My old bird feeder had the same capacity as this one and needed to be filled more often so I'm not sure if the mechanisms are working properly. And because I seem to have more birds since my cat stopped hanging out by that window, I think it must be that only one or two of the openings is working properly. (I'm choosing to view this as a positive attribute at this point since bird food is expensive.) This feeder is easier for me to fill than my last one, but that's not saying much. My neighbors have feeders that seem to be much easier, but not the high capacity of this one.I cannot attest to the squirrel-proofness cause we don't have a squirrel issue in our neighborhood for some reason. Chipmunks, however, are everywhere. I've been keeping my eye out for the scavengers on the feeder, but haven't seen any yet.
B000SP2JLU I don't have a huge problem with squirrels normally.  The few I do have are not bothering this feeder at all.  They did for the first few days and then gave up.  If that changes or I have other problems, I will update this review.  The one thing I do like is the fact that the larger birds have difficulty using this feeder.  Living in the city, means dealing with pigeons.  They and similar large birds are too heavy for this feeder.  Now maybe the smaller birds can get some food.  I am happy with the feeder so far.
B000SP2JLU I've used a feeder like this before and was glad to give this one a try. We have lots of birds and lots of squirrels. Lots of squirrels. This is designed so that if a squirrel manages to get onto it, his (or her) weight will cause the portals to close (spring-action) and they can't get at the seed. The other one I had like this lasted for several seasons. Highly recommend this feeder.
B000SP2JLU It's an interesting design but has a major flaw: The feeder tube is plastic and squirrels chewed through it in just a few weeks. Now the seed just pours out and the feeder useless.
B000SP2JLU This feeder is easy to fill and holds about 3 pounds of mixed bird seed per fill.  The adjustment springs are easily accessible and simple to operate.  Lengthening or stretching the spring increases the weight required to close off the feed ports and shortening the spring by hooking it in the highest adjustment hole causes the feed ports to close with less weight on the perches.I hung my feeder on a 6' tall shepherds hook well clear of tree branches and no squirrels have been able to get at it.  I have set my feeder on the shortest spring travel in an effort to keep flocks of blackbirds from emptying the feeder before the smaller birds get a chance to eat, and that worked for about 10 minutes - - - until the large birds discovered they could support their weight on the flange at the bottom of the feeder with one foot and grab the wire of the sliding cage with the other.  When 2 or 3 blackbirds do this they can feed until they are full.  If more birds land on the perches, the ports do close and all the birds leave, but then they return and repeat the process.  It slows the blackbirds down but does not stop them, so only 4 stars.This feeder does work well with cardinals, song sparrows, chickadees and similar birds when not harassed by the larger more aggressive birds.  I believe the flange around the bottom of the feeder would allow squirrels to get at the feed as easily as the blackbirds did however, if the feeder was placed in a location accessible to the squirrels.
B000SP2JLU From far away this is a nice looking bird feeder.  It works on a pressure system, if something weighs to much and is on the perch the plastic covering will slide down and block the hole to get the feed.  My issue with the feeder is that the little metal figures attached are very flimsy and bend way to easy and I have already had one come off my feeder after only a few weeks of use.I would give 5 stars for appearance because it is a nice looking feeder but it gets 3 stars for just feeling cheap.
B000SP2JLU We don't have squirrels, but this is a nice feeder anyway.  The birds have accepted it well, and it doesn't dump much seed on the ground.  Just fill it and hang it up.  No problems so far.
B000SQ32MY About as simple a device as one good imagine.  Only holds about 5 3&#34; chlorine tablets, but it does the job.  I use two of these in place of an in-line chlorinater and it keeps chlorine levels stable in a 20,000 gallon Florida pool.
B000SQ32MY Had to replace a floater that had cracked up due to years of sun exposure.  This one was a very good price and looks to be sturdy enough to last as long as the last one.  Easy to use, screw off cap, fill with chlorine tabs, put cap back on and toss in pool.  Would give it five stars but it is not as \"deep\" as it looks in the picture---thought it would hold more tablets but that is not really an issue with the item, just how the picture appears onscreen.
B000SQ32MY For my inground pool, I went through 2 offline chlorinator systems in 20 years.  The parts didn't actually break, but I was not able to get the lid off of them.  The glue used to hold the chlorine tablets together eventually coats the screw on lids (since they're filled to the top with water), and even with an incredible amount of force I wasn't able to open them after a period of years.  I bought this one in order to get away from that problem and it appears to work well.  I'm a bit surprised at how little chlorine actually gets dissolved in this unit.  I put five 3&#34; tablets in, and after a week there was still about 2.5 tablets left.  It isn't summer yet, so algae isn't a problem at the moment.  Then again, the water isn't very warm.  Perhaps when the water warms up the tablets will dissolve faster.  I would go through 10 tablets a week in the offline chlorinators in the summer.
B000SQ32MY If you own a swimming pool I think it's important to own a Floating Chlorine Dispenser.  It's a great place to keep your chlorine tablets.Plus, whenever you head out of town there's a greater chance you will come home to a better-looking pool if you choose to put two or three chlorine tablets in this floater.  As you know, chlorine is important for swimming pool water.  Putting chlorine tablets inside this floater will make the pool water clean and safe.However, I recommend you tie the floater to the side of the pool instead of letting it float around.  That's because, if the pool is running, the floater might get stuck in the filter.  Always make sure the chlorine floater is tied to the side, away from the filter.
B000SQ32MY I like this product so much it was a life saver because I wanted chlorine in my pool it didn't have a solution until I found this it is a simple solution to chlorine dispensing. Very inexpensive. Opens easily. Dispenses the chlorine effectively.It even has a sliding &#34;door&#34; that allows you to increase/decrease the amount of water flowing through the chlorinator; I've left in on &#34;full open&#34;, but this is a nice feature, I would think, if you need a slower dispersal rate.I haven't elected to tie it to the side of my pool as one reviewer suggests, but simply let it float around the pool and it doesn't seem to get drawn to the skimmers as I think the reviewer was suggesting it might. Just floats around the pool doing its job. ThanksMay 7, 2014 Update I tied this last to side of pool with string the floating around didn't as I though it would work for me .
B000SQ32MY I used to buy the expensive animal-shaped ones, but they always die within a year in the Arizona sun. I will update this review once I know how survivable it is, but in the mean time for the price you can't beat it. Easily holds 4 regular (3\") chlorine tabs.If I was going to nitpick, and it isn't enough to adjust my rating, the fact that it's so well balanced means it doesn't start to tip when the pucks are almost used - I used to consider that a feature of other models so I didn't have to fish it out and check the tab status.
B000SQ32MY Before they get so ratty and discolored that I want to replace them.  I am happy with it and I would order again if I had the need.
B000SQ32MY I have an 18' round pool and bought this to replace an old one that the lid wouldn't stay on anymore.  This one works great but it is about twice the size of the one I had previously (8 or 9&#34; across)  It still works fine but I guess i was expecting this to be the same size as the last one.
B000SQ32MY I fired my pool guy who loved to over chlorinate and never acidified my pool &#8230; that is, when he showed up, if he showed up at all.  This, a creepy crawley, and a little muriatic acid are keeping my pool sparkly clean.
B000SQ32MY It's only been one season so far. It holds the 3&#34; tabs easily, floats around the pool without real fuss. We had maybe 10 kids in there and it didn't split open or otherwise get damage. now it's just about longevity I guess.
B000SQ32MY Does the job, but sometimes the lid doesn't stay on.  I like to fill it up with 3 chlorine tablets and then throw this sucker back into the pool.  Unfortunately throwing it sometimes causes the lid to disconnect, open up, and tablets at the bottom of my pool.  No more throwing!  Other than that, this works well.
B000SQ32MY This item was a great buy. It was reasonably priced and seems to be lasting longer than other similar products like this that I have owned.
B000UGT94C Peat Pots.... not much to say.  Hold their shape well, and slowly disentegrate over time once planted.  Work great for transplants and plantings.
B000UGT94C Have to get more of these!The only thing is they get stuck to one another from I guess how they make them so don't try to pull them out with a wrench like my husband tried or they will tear!  Other then that they are great!
B000UGT94C Always a useful item to have around the garden. Just throw in some potting soil and it&#8217;s ready. The entire pot is planted, reducing stress on seedlings.
B000UGT94C These are so easy and work so well for me. I start the seeds in the Jiffy Pellets and transplant the whole thing into the 3 inch pot with Jiffy seed starter soil and in the spring, I plan the whole pot in the ground, or put the transplant pot into a ceramic pot for inside.
B000UGT94C I love these - they are holding up quite well. And I really like the idea that you simply put it in the ground with your plant. MUCH better than all those little plastic pots!
B000UGT94C It's hard to say bad things about these pots. You plant your seeds in them, water them, and when you see the roots start to poke through the bottom, you transplant the whole thing into your garden (or a larger pot, if you'd like). You can start plants with even the most delicate roots indoors, and transplant them out without killing them by breaking the roots when tapping them out of the pot.The big problem is that the pot material wicks moisture out of the soil. I have to water seedlings in these pots two or three times as often as ones in reusable plastic pots. The best solution i've found is to buy plastic pots that are exactly the same size as these, and nest the peat pot inside the plastic one. That way the moisture stays in, but i can still transplant the seedling without disturbing its roots.
B000UGT94C When I germinate seeds in peat pots, I put the pots in cooking trays and keep some water in them which effectively becomes a self-watering container. The Jiffy pots held up well. These basically fell apart when I tried to plant the germinated plants.I would not use again.
B000UHDDJI This is my 3rd purchase of all different sizes.  None of the hoses had any issues when used for the past 2 years.  The recent one I bought had a small leak when connecting the male end into a hand sprayer.  I used plumbers tape to create a tight seal within the threads and it fixed the problem.  I think it was the hand sprayer that actually had the problem and not the hose.  I had purchased a hose from Home Depot before I purchased these hoses and that hose looks like it got stung by mosquitos.  There's bumps all over the hose which indicates a weak inner casing.These platinum hoses have been sitting out in the Summer Heat and have also sat out all Winter long.  No cracks, bumps, or signs of wear and tear due to the elements.  Although the hose does kink it is easily fixed if you handle and store it correctly.  I don't think there's a hose out there that doesn't kink and has these great qualities and materials.  The large rubber grip and spring are a plus.  IMO it's easier to tighten and loosen than using the standard metal coupling on standard hoses.  I can see that all of my hoses will last for years to come.
B000UHDDJI I ordered two of these hoses plus a hose reel IN THE SAME ORDER.  I emphasize the order as the hose is fine...reel is great...but the hose feature..the Trip Grip Collar..would be great if I was hooking to the hose to a faucet....but the collar is so big around it won't fit on the male connector on the reel.  It took two hours to cut the molded plastic collar from the hose to give enough room to hook it to the reel.  I don't blame the hose..or the reel...I blame the guy who pulled these things off a shelf to ship them or someone up the line from him/her who should know their products well enough to realize if I ordered the hose and reel together I planned to use them together.  This was not a pleasant experience.The hose reel, by the way, is a Ames Sidewinder and this makes my second, replacing a couple of Suncrest that just broke where connected to the house. The plastic was not intended to work with a 100 foot hose, which is what was advertised.  It not only did not easily hold 100 feet but was too heavy for the plastic reel.
B000UHDDJI This is a very substantial hose, that is, it doesn't feel cheap.  It is thick, which you'd expect with the extra plies.  I think that makes it just a bit heavier than a standard hose, but I think it's worth it.  I don't have any trouble moving it around the lawn or garden, and so far, anyway, there is not even a whisper of a kink. I don't see how it could, the walls are thick and smooth.The first time we attached it to the faucet, it leaked a lot from underneath the black covering.  But we took it off and made another try at screwing it in, and the second time it seated right and now there is no leak whatsoever.At 5/8\" it carries a LOT of water. This also means filling up the watering can quickly.I couldn't wait to throw our old kinked-out hose away and couldn't be happier with this one. Really an excellent hose.//////////////////////////November 1, 2011Adding onto my review just to say, I've been using the hose all summer, now, and it is truly a wonderful hose. Not a kink in sight, either.
B000UHDDJI UPDATE- Year later even nastier at the one connection - now to do as one person did and break the collar............ The COIL/Spring there already shifted out.....6/9/2012 Originally there was Much aggravation on my second of the same hose rec'd today - tried 9 times at spigot - and then even unto the other one - adding pictures - only difference is less leakage when ** connecting to the 1st one **  - Yet not acceptable as more from under collar also -UPDATE: 6/17/2012: picture after a Gilmour* washer inserted - Zip fix*********************************************************************It does loop/link if you don't watch it when walking with it but impressed with the weight and durability reviews - this will not go on a reel or into a hose house as they can damage a hose big time.
B000UHDDJI If I had known how much I'd like this hose, I'd have hooked it up a lot sooner. The tri-grip collar made for one of the easiest and most secure connections I've ever had with a hose. The large collar is easy to grip and allows for plenty of manual torque. The other end with a metal coupling also allowed easy nozzle attachment.So far I've experienced no kinks and winding up the hose has also been a good experience. The next time I have to buy a hose, the Gilmour Platinum will be my first choice.Gilmour backs this hose with a full lifetime replacement policy and no fine print.
B000UJZCBS I have used the peanut butter Suit cakes from this company with great success to the point the birds fought over it, HOWEVER this Suit DD-24 melt into a blob in 90 - 100 degree temperatures we have been having and the birds take one peck and leave it for seeds. Now I'm stuck with 11 more of these things.If my birds become active (I'll give it another 2 weeks) with this I'll update and make an edit but right now it's thumbs down and I should have ordered more of what worked before (peanut butter suit).
B000UJZCBS The woodpeckers stole this off the porch they love it so much. Ordered a holder so it won't happen again
B000UJZCBS We bought this case of suet cakes to supply our new Stokes Select Squirrel-Proof Double Suet Feeder.  Within a few hours, the feeder became a most popular place for the smaller-sized bird species.  While the feeder holds 2 suet cakes, we&#8217;re loading the feeder every 3-4 days (which is rather impressive.)  At $1.50 a cake (with free 2-day Prime member shipping), the case is a good deal to man and bird.
B000UJZCBS I used to make my own suet for my winter birds. I found this had everything I like in my suet. I did some pricing and found out that this was a better deal.
B000UJZCBS My wildlife loves this.  One will last about 3-4 days and only overnight if the raccoon comes.  When they like it I keep buying it.Since we take up more and more of their environment I think it's only fair to give them a helping hand.  It's getting cold out there and a full belly helps them stay warm.
B000UJZCBS We have used this for years.  While the peanut version is a bit more popular, this one is good an is cheaper.  Recommended.
B000UJZCBS I get a number of different bird species with woodpeckers being my favorite. This suet, as many others have noted doesn't hold together very well. You have to be extremely gentle with it when taking it out of the package or it falls apart. Aside from that, the birds like it, and it's reasonably priced.
B000UJZCBS So nice and super cheaper then one by one at the store's.I like it. I keep it all in my freezer so it stays nice and handy anytime I need one for my bird feeders.
B000UJZCBS Well I don't eat it but the birds sure do! Very popular with the woodpeckers and many other birds too.
B000V1UU6M This doesn't take on the tough stuff but it will do good as a light cleaner. I will stick with simple green in the future and just rinse good.
B000V1UU6M Works great on grease and grill grime. Add water with your grill pro cleaning brush and your grill is much easier to maintain. Received  packaged in plastic bag separated from sprayer with capped bottle. I would recommend
B000V1UU6M Like anything else that cleans, you usually have to use a little elbow grease to make these cleaners work.  If you leave this product on for a few minutes and then brush grill with a steel brush, most (not all) of the junk comes off.  A second coating usually will do the trick unless it is super gross black oil/charcoal stuff baked on.  At least you don't inhale all kinds of naseous fumes like some products.
B000V1UU6M I used this product to clean the grates in the kitchen sink. The scent is rather strong and I would recommend cleaning outside if possible.
B000V1UU6M This product can e used only on cool grill grates. I use it periodically to \"fine tune\" my cleaning.I remove the grill grates from the grill, spray this on, let it penetrate for a couple of minutes, and then use myGrill Brush 18\" - Heavy Duty BBQ Tool, which I dip repeatedly into water while scraping. Afterwards I use paper towels to wipe down the grill grates. Although the directions say to use papers towels in the first instance, using a grill brush first is much more effective.I agree with the leading negative review that this product will not make a dent in \"carbonized food\", i.e. those sections of the grill grates that now have a smooth black finish. But that's only a small portion of my grill grates. With this product and my grill brush I have been able to restore the rest of the surfaces to looking brand new--though lots of \"elbow grease\" is required. I'm not really that concerned with the carbonized sections, though I can use Easy Off if I want to on them.But unlike Easy Off, this product is non corrosive and non toxic. It's a lot safer to handle.Bottom line: Except for sections of grates that have carbonized food, this works really well provided you use it with a grill brush.
B000VC1AOM This little gizmo has saved my @$$ on several gigs, when it located pins I needed, to do surveys. It also found a very expensive, very small, specialized tool that another crew member dropped in the tall grass.  Highly recommended.
B000VC1AOM I purchased this metal detector because of its simple use for the beginner and tha attractive price. Out of the box I installed two fresh Duracell 9 volt alkaline batteries. Started to scan my yard and uncovered 2 quarters that were down about an inch. Also found an old token. Not bad for the first few minutes. I gave the unit a 4 star for the following reasons. 1). The unit started to randomly go off after the second day of use. There was no low battery signal but I checked the 9 volt batteries and they were at 8.46 volts. I replaced the batteries and the unit was fine. 2). There is NO volume button. So, if you are using it with the speaker everyone around you will know you are looking for treasures unless you use headphones. 3). The unit is extremely lightweight; however, the plastic screen on the LCD readout is flimsy and can damage easily.  4). The coin setting will also pick up other metals, like aluminum. Nice starter unit; however the battery consumption needs to be looked at. I will most likely invest in one of the more advanced units at some point.
B000VC1AOM The metal detector I received isn't what I ordered. When I go to the orders page there's no Seller Feedback button to contact Amazon to find out what I have. The area where the model name/number is usually placed is blank and the only indication of it's identity is where &#34;Bounty Hunter&#34; is printed on the face of the control box. The Owners Manual says Quick Draw II BUT the face of the control box isn't the same as the Owners Manual or the pictures of the Quick Draw II on Amazon, Kellyco or Youtube videos. I don't know what I received because it doesn't have a model name or number on it and Amazon doesn't have a seller feedback button on my &#34;Orders&#34; page to contact the seller. It may be an upgrade from the original model I ordered but so far I can't figure out what I have. The control box face is the same as the Pioneer 202 but the name isn't on the face. Looks to me like they repackaged a bunch of stuff and sent it without thinking about the Owners Manual not being the same as the model they sent. I'm a little irritated with Amazon for not leaving me a way to resolve this issue. The product may in fact be OK but I'd like to know what the product is and get the correct Owners Manual for it so I can adjust it to it's best performance.
B000VC1AOM It appears to just randomly beep!Sweeping the same area gives different results very time. No volume control, so when it beeps its very annoying.I tried to locate some buried copper wires without success. They are buried 1 foot deep and this thing missed them and then beeped in other areas doing one pass but not the other. I even went over an area that had the clear line of where the ire was buried, and it didn't beep once.Yawn. Waste of time.
B000VC1AOM I really dont know what to say about this detector.  Thats because I never had a chance to use it. After unpacking it, I find that the face of the detector is cracked.  I decided to see if it work, to get an idea if I wanted to replace it or just get a refund, it did nothing but hummmmm.  So I cant really give a honest review on the workings of this detector. The packaging was standard.  Cardboard box with slots to hold the detector in place. So I dont know if the box was dropped during shipment or if it was packaged that way. I have nothing but high marks for Amazon, so Im hoping it wasnt package with the equipment broken.Ive decided to buy one around my home town, so when I do, I will come back with an update. Till then, keep shopping with Amazon.
B000VOECSG Before I start this review, I do need to preface it with the fact that I ordered this from the Warehouse deals section here in amazon.  It was used, so I don't know if that is a factor or not.That said, we had to return this saw.  It never did cut through anything at all.  The chain kept falling off, no matter how many times we put the thing back on, it just wouldn't stay on.  Even took it to our neighbor, who is quite the handyman to look at and well, his opinion of it - you really can't say those types of words here!  I suppose if we reordered it again, new this time, that it might be different.  I'm not taking a chance, however, and I'm ordering the McCulloch here on amazon instead.  We've had 50 years of success with their chainsaws and well, guess I should have ordered that one in the first place.My purpose for writing this review is a bit of a beware if you're ordering something like this from Amazon's warehouse deals.  They don't check them very well sometimes when someone returns them and you can really wind up with a \"dud.\"  Something as dangerous as a chainsaw can be, that could be quite worrisome.  I've had other items from the warehouse that had mismatched parts and after I returned them, they put them back online for someone else to buy!  Brother!  Just be careful, sometimes you really get what you pay for, or don't, in this situation.
B000VOECSG This chainsaw is very reliable and does a great job at cutting down thin trees, branches and firewood logs.  Don't expect this thing to be able to cut down huge oak trees in your backyard - it has its limitations.  Not only is that not advisable without a professional, but it will likely overwork the motor and signficantly cut down the life of your chain saw.  Have used this chain saw extensively and am very happy with it for minor projects and really an important tool for every homeowner to have.
B000VOECSG I had a 30-foot-tall pine tree fall in a recent storm and bought this 14\" Remington Limb & Trim to deal with it. The maximum diameter of the trunk was maybe 8 inches.Despite my lack of any chainsaw experience, in about 30 minutes, I had all the branches in a nice pile, and the trunk was cut into manageable, firewood-size pieces.The saw is lightweight and very easy to use - just fill the oil reservoir with a little motor oil, push the oil bulb a few times, plug it in and go. I never felt like the saw was going to kick back and it feels very solid in my hands. That said, I can't imagine this would be of much use to someone cutting up huge, 14-inch diameter trees, but for light-duty cutting and limb trimming, it seems perfect.Even though it's a small saw, always wear eye protection and ear protection (it is somewhat loud, though quieter than a gas saw.) And read the manual - it's not like a TV, you can actually maim yourself if you're not careful!I will revise this review if I find that the saw doesn't last long.
B000VOECSG This is a very nice saw.  While it is not meant to do big jobs, I cut down an Ash tree that was 12 inches in diameter at the base and this little devil just cut through is very well.  A gas powered saw would do the job better, but it worked just fine for me and is great for what it was designed for which is trimming limbs, branches, etc.
B000VOECSG I originally purchased this saw to do some pruning and that's what my original review was based upon. I'm updating that review now after using it for nearly 18-months. As a general purpose chainsaw it has a few issues but they seem much more minor now than when I first used it in 2012. The two most notable issues are that the chain pops off easily and the oil system leaks. The more I used it the better I got at not doing the things that bind the chain and cause it to pop off... you can't angle the bar at all once you start cutting but my gas saw is much more forgiving on that point. I have a 20\" gas McCulloch chainsaw from the 80's that I was using most of the time but it's heavy and I don't like to use it sideways and/or near the ground because it's a beast to handle and if the chain hits the dirt I have to stop to sharpen it. I had some large stumps I wanted to cut even with the ground so I wanted something lightweight to do it and that's the only reason I purchased this and it did what I wanted it to... even on stumps over 12\" in diameter by walking it around the stump. I was prepared to put up with some of the criticisms other reviews have mentioned and it's because of those that I didn't recommend this as a go-to saw for all cutting. However, I reach for this saw first now whenever I have to cut within 100\" of my outside outlets... there's a drop in torque which is expected but it still performs adequately. I would recommend this saw as a general purpose tool and I use it for cutting all my rounds because it's lightweight, I can use it one-handed and it's quick to sharpen the blade... though it's hard to keep the cord plugged in tightly all the time. I feel a bit safer with my gas saw because it's built well, the weight of the saw makes horizontal cutting easy and the chain has never popped off... but gas, difficulty in starting and the weight of it are issues... but once you get about 100' from an outlet that's about all I can use. If you run this saw on more than 100' of cord it will likely not last too long and I use a 50' cord whenever possible by dragging the trees closer to the outlet.I use this saw whenever possible... and definitely for low horizontal cutting and whenever I'm on a ladder... because it's so lightweight. It's also very easy to use when trimming off the branches after a tree is down because you have a hand free to maneuver around. I paid about 42 bucks for it and it was a good deal... I cut about 2-cords of wood before I had to sharpen the blade and the blade on mine was a decent one from Oregon. I was using a reciprocating saw but this cuts much faster than I thought it would so I use it all the time now. I think the best feature is that it's always ready to go... no issues with gas mixing, gas pouring, spark plugs, clogged carburetor, dirty air filter, starting issues, pull chains or weight issues. The standard rounds I cut are 6-10\" and there's no way this saw bogs down doing it... and the oil is standard 30-weight automotive so that's also easy to handle. Some love it and some don't but I cut a lot of wood for my two wood stoves and I don't have a serious negative about this saw.
B000VU222S I had lower back disk fusion surgery 3 months ago. In my post-surgical state I have trouble bending and lifting heavy objects. But I can work the Toro Power Shovel! I bought it with low expectation, thinking that either it will not work well or that I will have trouble with it due to my current physical limitation. Surprisingly, neither concern materialized. Toro easily chopped through 10 inch snow bank left from 18 inches that fell a few days ago, and I was able to push it through the snow as well as move it up and down the stairs to the house. In some areas I was able to push it one handed which was an easier position on my back, and sometimes I needed the second hand to get through a tougher spot. The handle is adjustable so with the highest position I don't have to bend too much.Wet snow update:I am updating this review after the first wet snow. Toro power shovel handled it well! It was a little harder to push, but I found that I could brace the handle on my thigh and that allowed me to push with my leg rather than my injured back. Then it was easy!The hardest thing to deal was not the show shovel itself, but the 100 feet of electric cord, which was heavy, unwieldy and became almost unmanageable to coil back, especially when it became cold and covered with snow. The electric caddy was not much help, it was hard to control. Putting back the cord tired me out more than shoveling itself.I found that the Toro power shovel was stable without having to lean it against a wall when I put it a big plastic storage bin (see picture). This way when I bring the shovel in and the snow melts I will not have a puddle on the floor. The caddy with the electrical cord fit nicely on top of the shovel in the bucket (see picture).This product is build for a right-handed person.Update:I found a solution for an electric cord winding - it is called Green Leaf WW-1 Wonder Winder Hand Crank:Green Leaf WW-1 Wonder Winder Hand Crank Extension Cord WinderAli Julia review
B000VU222S Our neighbor has an ancient Toro power shovel and has been kind enough to loan it to us on several occasions.  Each year as we thought of getting one, they were sold out, and snow wasn't imminent.So this year we ordered one and while it is not as wide a span as our neighbor's older one, it did seem to have more power.A few days after our purchase and initial use, our Consumer's Reports mag. arrived and rated this shovel 15 out of 100!  We also experienced a major snow storm with accumulation in some areas of 30 inches.But, we do find it does help quite a bit.  It is not one of the highly touted power models, but neither is the price.  We don't have a huge area to clean and it assists with our regular shovel to help clear the snow away.There is definitely a knack to using it and its most difficult feature is manueverability in small path areas since you have to use it on a slight curve.All in all we are keeping it, using it, but consider it just another welcome adjunct tool in removing the dreaded snow accumulation on our property.
B000VU222S One of those products that again, makes you wonder, \"What took them so long?\" When you hear of how many people have had heart attacks shoveling snow, this just seems like one of those \"obvious\" inventions. Not everyone has enough space to warrant purchasing a huge snow blower so well, what to do? We grabbed this machine the first year it came out and boy, has it been awesome! We've been bad too - blowing more inches that it was supposed to at at time but no matter, this guy just keeps on going! But one of the best things we've noticed is that it really comes in handy when looking for something for your elderly grandmother or grandparents to use. You just plug the thing in and go! No more worrying about them falling on the ice and snow, this thing just pushes like a vacuum cleaner and they have clear steps. Of course, you can do it yourself to really make sure but sometimes, that isn't possible in snowy weather. The kids think they're pretty fun too - they don't mind helping out with the shoveling when you have this thing around.  It shoots snow 12 feet into the all, making it look like a blizzard.  Lots of giggles on that!  But make sure you keep them out of the way of it though - too easy to pick up projectiles if you're not careful.All-in-all, this machine is really a lifesaver, one that we've appreciated for the past 10 years. Recommend!
B000VU222S This is review written with Montana winter experience.The reviews were generally good with this item so I bought one, mainly for the convenience of easily cleaning the drawbridge, walkways, entry, and in front of my garage without a shovel.This device is pre-assembled, easily carried, easy to use, fast, quiet, and very user friendly.  The only drawback is not with the machine; it is getting a low temperature cord that remains flexible in the cold.  I suggest the yellow Solar cord that is good to about -50 offered through Amazon. To keep the cord out of the way always completely clean the area closest to the electrical outlet and progress forward; do not go way forward and back-track.  I use it like I use a vacuum.Overall excellent!!  It takes the snow right down to the ground and even gets the hard compacted snow from where the cars enter the garage without a problem.  Very fast, and you can easily change the length of the shaft so you do not have to bend over.  The blade is plastic but seems very durable; it has run into some small objects, plant edges, and small rocks and I notice no wear after several uses.  My wife is happy to not shovel, and it is easy on her bad back, and mine.I give it 5 stars easily, and and am buying one for the office with a low temp. 100 ft. cord.  So far I highly recommend this device for the easily accessable areas of traffic when you don't want to haul out the gas driven blowers, or shovel, or snow plow.  It will even tackle drifts with ease if you take your time and start waving it across the top.  It is fast and simple to use.  The Broom model is more expensive but is only needed if you decide to change the blade and use it for summer-time dirt blowing.  This model is a great one for just snow and is at a great price.  Don't expect it to be durable for heavy slush, ice, deep snow, or large areas like driveways.Hope this helps.Update 12-29-07Excell
B000VU222S We were getting snow about 5 days before Christmas so my wife asked me if I wanted one of my presents early.  I knew she meant this one and I was quite pleased. We got about 5 inches of light powdery stuff before I went outside to start this up. I can report it worked very well on that type of snow.  It shoots it out mush further than I thought it would, at least 12 to 15 feet.  You have to work with whatever wind there is, but this was a great tool to have around. We haven't had any further snow, but I would recommend this for dry snow falls with no reservation at all.
B000VU222S I read all the reviews and decided that the Positives had it! It arrived, already opended. I waited for snow and got excited to use the new tool to save my back. Wrong, it about broke it. Made sure I had it right. Had to pick it up and sit it down every inch then it only spit the snow at me no matter which way the wind was blowing.Clogged with 2 inches of snow and stopped altogether. I guess I got a deffective one thank goodness Amazon is paying for the return. Would have been good if it worked.I gave it a 3 since mine didn't work :( Maybe others will have better luck.
B000VU222S This is one nice tool, as long as you're using it for the purpose intended.  It's not going to handle a snow accumulation of more than six inches without doing other work to reduce the accumulation to six inches, and six inches is going to be pretty slow going.  Its nominal twenty-inch swath means that it's going to take a while to clean off a big driveway of any size.  It shoots snow out its front; if you want to change the direction that the snow is going, you have to change the direction that you're pointing the snow thrower.  It has, however, cut the time for me to clear a 70' X 20' driveway of a couple of inches of snow by about 50%, and that's been well worth the price for me.
B000VU222S Never thought of Central Virginia as a haven for snow, but the Winter of 2010 and this Winter (2013/14) have proven to be just that. Not snows like Upstate NY mind you, but multiple snows this year of four or more inches, and in 2010/11 we had snow walls (resulting from shoveling and snow plows) approaching five feet tall.This little snow shovel was on sale a few years ago for about seventy bucks with shipping included, so we grabbed it up. Excellent deal -- it is not a big shovel, only cutting a path about one foot wide at a time, and only dealing with about six inches of snow depth at a time. Still... that has been exactly what we needed, and it throws the snow 15 to 20 feet forward.To be effective with it, I have been clearing our 60 foot long x 20 feet wide driveway off at an angle, throwing the snow forward toward our yard and our neighbor's yard (shhh... please don't tell them!). Most of the snow we have been receiving has been of the light, fluffy variety and this blower works perfectly with that stuff. All you have to do is make sure that you are not blowing the light snow into the wind or else it will blow right back in your face. Blowing with the wind is optimal, if you can plan it that way.The driveway job averages about 45 minutes, give or take a few. Moving the snow off of the driveway allows the sun to get to its surface, heating the surface up helping to further melt the remaining ice/snow which allows the driveway to dry off a bit. Nice to end up with a dry, clear driveway instead of having to worry about slipping and falling all the time. Thankfully, I have a slew of commercial grade extension cords that allow me to plow the entire driveway and even about 30 feet or so of the cul-d-sac we live on. Good deal.The blower is fairly lightweight so I never felt like my arm was going to fall off, even though I would use it for an hour or more at a time. The handle is also nicely placed to allow easy pushing and balancing, which surely helped keep the fatigue away.Is the blower perfect? No... we have an aggregate stone driveway and, once you get down to the base level past the snow, the blower does become very difficult to push along and its skid plate shows associated wear & tear. If it had some sort of small wheels or a skid plate that was thicker, it might help. On asphalt this is not an issue at all. If the thrower portion had built in louvers allowing me to modify the direction that the snow was being thrown, jobs would be a ton easier as I could just go straight down the driveway - directing the snow as needed. Other than those two things, this blower works well for the snow amounts we typically have here in Virginia.If you are looking for an electric snow shovel of this size and style, and if your conditions are like those that we experience as described above, then we would recommend this unit to you.  If you are trying to move large volumes of snow in a high snow region, then a bigger unit is probably better for your needs.Recommended
B000VU222S The power shovel is very narrow; much narrower than an actual shovel and with only a half inch of snow it struggles if you go too fast.  I'd guess this is a tiny improvement time-wise over shoveling manually but it does eliminate having to throw the snow so if you have a bad back you might like this little machine.  I used it once, and after that used a shovel.  By the time I got the extension cord out, plugged it in, and then put all that back together I just didn't feel like the job was much easier (if at all) or took much less time (if at all).  This is a purchase I regret - even though I got it on sale for $50.
B000VU222S I really so wanted this to be a 5 star rating, but!I ordered this after the snows of last year to be ready for the new year snow.  I only needed it now because some neighborhood boys made me an offer I could not refuse and they shoveled me out the last snow.But the Mid Adlantic storm hit us hard in Jersey and I could not get any takers so I dug out my new machine.I bundled up with scarf and hat and I was ready.I was so excited to try my new toy.I pluged it in and nothing!!! Not even a whirrrr. Nothing.I changed outlets, a different cord still NOTHING!!I had to shovel what I have 'cause another one is coming tomorrow, urgh!I took it back to our local place I got it from and asked if they possibly had another, no.There were 5 standing in the corner, dare I ask? They all did not start and were going back I am not too angry, in fact I am going to try again since I believe it is a good product in general.If I hear anyone mention that granny (that is me) should not use this because it is heavy I will scream. They can come to my house and try out how heavy it is to shovel 2 feet of snow with a hand shovel.  I know I would have to shave the snow blah blah blah, but I know it would be a lot easier than what I just did.Don't even mention condos (been there done that) and nursing homes (will never do that), I can probably shovel faster and longer than any youngen'  :)If I get another one that works I hope I can up the rating, I am happy it works for most of you. Happy shoveling
B000VU4KM8 I saw this until on a TV show that sells items....looked really handy as I have a lot of landscaping and I already had the WORX EDGER with the lithium battery I am crazy about...SO I knew about WORX quality already...and the price and reviews on their web page was really good.....Almost got it but decided to check AMAZON.COM first....low and behold it was priced LESS and FREE SHIPPING...ordered it in less than a minute from AMAZON...arrived in 2 days! Gave it run and it was so much better than my old Black and Decker vacuum.....and much handier with the shoulder bag....They weren't kidding about the force of the blower either....So Nice to have both a Blower and Vac together that mulches great....already putting free mulch in my garden beds.....
B000VU4KM8 I'll just write this review and then go out and clear my neighbor's yard of leaves! That's how much I like this product.First off, I like the size of the collection bag.  When you're petite like me, those huge bags from other makers are just too big.  Another plus is the lever that lets you quickly switch from vacuum mode to blower.  The blower power and vacuum suction are impressive, and it does an exceptional job of mulching leaves for my Winter garden.This is the second WORX yard machine I've bought, and I'm enjoying both of them.  I think they produce a quality product that makes yard work more fun than drudgery.
B000VU4KM8 I have two gas powered blower vacs. While both work great, they are heavy and cumbersome to use for small jobs such as clearing off the back patio. So, thought an electric would be the way to go since I could store it by the back door without any concern about leaking gas/oil.Looked at serval models, and settled on the Worx for two reasons: 1) I have one of their chain saws and have been very pleased with it; and 2) they offer the quick-shift ability from blower to vac. I have that on one of my gas blowers and absolutely love it. While the quick shift design does rob some blowing power, it more than makes up for it with ease of use.There are a couple of other quick-shift electric blower/vacs out there (models from Ryobi, Troy-Bilt and Yardman) but the Worx seemed to be better-built, and has a more user-friendly bag design.After several uses I am 100% satisfied with my purchase. The blowing power is adequate. It won't compete with a good gas blower, but it gets the job done, especially on hard surfaces. The vac performance is excellent. Pulled in all sorts of leaves, twigs and mulched them up very well. Even held its own when it came to wet leaves, which are a challenge even for a gas machine. Took longer, but Worx snarfed them up.Weight is great - compared with a gas model, this is a featherweight. Also love the fact that you can access the impeller to clear out clogs without using any tools. Nice, thoughtful design feature.I have mixed feelings about the bent nozzle. On the plus side, it comes in handy for some tasks, such as using the vac under a table or to get the leaves that pack around the base of bushes. But, on level surfaces it is a bit of a pain since you have to stoop a bit. I'm 6 ft 2in, so if you're shorter that won't be a problem.The bag construction is decent. Not as robust as the bag on my Stihl, but seems like it will last for some time. The collection bags on any blower vac are its Achilles heel. I've found that extending bag life is possible if you take it easy with the zipper, don't fill it to bursting, and leave it open to dry when not in use. Plan on replacing the zipper after a couple of years. It's easy to do - just cut the teeth off the old one, and sew the new one (a long, heavy-duty jacket zipper) over the old. It won't look tidy, but it's fast, easy and works. Done it a few times with other bags on other blowers.While I'll continue to use a gas blower in the fall for the big jobs, this guy is much lighter, quieter and easier to use for the smaller jobs. Highly recommend.
B000VU4KM8 The good news is that this vacuum really sucks. It gobbled up the leaves and sent them into the bag just as it was intended to do. The blower feature provides a decent blow although not overwhelming. It is easy to switch between vacuum and blower.The bad news is that this unit is fairly heavy unless you are young and in excellent physical condition. A strap is provided which apparently is intended to assist in carrying the unit. However, I have not been able to situate the strap in a way that keeps the bag in its proper place. If I put the strap on the shoulder opposite the side where the unit is held then the bag is all wrapped up around me. If I put it on the shoulder of the same side as the unit then the strap slides right off. Very frustating.I am a Worx fan and have purchased all of their lithium ion battery operated cordless devices and plan to buy more when/if they become available. My only issue with Worx has been that they provide very lame user guides. However, this TriVac has been put on the market prematurely IMHO. This product has potential but needs more attention to detail by a savvy engineer. I cannot recommend this product in its current configuration.
B000VU4KM8 A twin-barreled blower/vac .... switch between functions on the fly ... it sounds great, doesn't it? It sure does!I took the plunge. I have a 1/4-acre lot with 6 maple trees, in a neighborhood full of full-grown trees of various species. I am also on a cul-de-sac, on a sloped property, with terraces and walls, and a privacy fence. I have a *ton* of corners and crevices that suck up leaves every year.And every year, I haul out a rake, a mower, a trash can, and a corded blower ... multiple times. My usual routine is to rake leaves onto lawns and mulch them in. A great mulching mower makes short work of them.I bought this unit thinking it might speed up my routine, and be an easier way to suck leaves out of corners, and allow me to bag mulch for easy, targeted composting.After an hour's use, I returned it.Why? Let me counts the ways ....1.  It's a compromise ... a blower and a vacuum that does neither well. The blower is serioudly underpowered compared to the $30 weedeater model I have. The vacuum can only pick up smaller, drier, freshly fallen leaves, and only manages that slowly. If the material has been in place and had a chance to lock together, forget it. After the first bag full, I resorted to shoving the barrel into a pile, letting it get a hold on a (small) handful of leaves, raising it, and using my other hand to coaxing them in.2. Plastic impeller ... if you do decide to try this Trivac, get the -502 model. The plastic impeller does mulch, but not terribly finely. Even at it's slow feed rate, this unit filled it bag every 5 minutes or so.3. Horribly awkward, and short. Typical blower/vacs have to be reconfigured. When setup for blowing, they are pointed at the ground. Use this Trivac for 10 minutes, and you'll see why. Due to it's design, it avoids the need to reconfigure .. and creates a new, worse problem. As the bag fills, the center of gravity shifts farther back, and in no time you're forced to *force* the nozzle downward, constantly. I finally started holding it by the bag and/or cord. Not good design at all. The taller you are (anything over 5'4\" or so, I'm 6'), the worse this becomes.4.  Storage. It's much larger than blowers that outperform it. And has an ungainly configuration. It's even a pain when you *aren't* using it!To sum up, 2 stars because it does--technically--work. However, it's a complete failure as a power tool. The point of a power tool is to amplify human effort. While using this, I got *less* done. Raking them and mowing them is much faster.So who is this thing good for? I don't know, really. It's too large and heavy for someone who has trouble clearing leaves by other means. Perhaps if you have mostly paved ares, and a very minor leaf burden, or are very limited on green areas you can mulch them in ... perhaps. If you have to bag your leaves, I honestly think you'd be better off renting a standing unit, and feeding them in by hand. You'll be done much faster.Unless you have very small hands ... !
B000VU4KM8 The Worx TriVac is an awesome blower / vacuum although I mostly use it for the vacuum feature. It sucks up and grinds up leaves and clippings without hesitation. The bag is big enough to accommodate a lot of material so you are not constantly needing to stop and empty it, while at the same time it is not so big that its uncomfortable while working.My only complaint is the cord. I know that batteries are getting better all the time and will eventually get to tools like this and I look forward to that. I have a fairly large yard and linking up extension cords and whipping them around during leaf cleanup can be a bit of a task in itself. That is not a fault of the product though, the tool works amazing and is the best I have owned (previously owned 2 Craftsman models, 1 Toro) and they all broke in some manner that was unfix-able within a season or 2 of light use.
B000VXYV6K I liked this because it didn't need a collar around the animal to work. I thought that it would, therefore, be good to keep raccoons and possums away from the chicken coop at night. I knew I couldn't turn it on during the day when the chickens were near it but I didn't realize it would injure any animal under 30 pounds.For me that was too dangerous. I wanted to protect but not kill the stray little cat that wanders my yard nor my little dog when I come to visit the chickens...didn't want to electrocute all the birds that landed on the fence either.Things I hadn't thought about.I can't hardly fault the fence...this is what it's made to do. but I do wish that somehow I could adjust it as it's made for animals 30 lbs and over but not safe for those below it.And that's lots of animals. Yes, it would protect against what I wanted it to but a bit scary that it's unsafe for the rest so it's nothing something I can use unless I know a predator is in the area.So let's get to how it works. It's a great size fence for the area...can go on for a mile. It is basic but a little tricky to set up.It does work and for someone protecting their animals from predators I have to love it for that. Many electrical fences wouldn't because they won't work without a collar. If someone is losing pets or chickens or whatever to a known predator I believe this would be a good fence.For example, to keep coyotes away.But for me there are too many other gentle creatures it zaps to be able to use it day to day. However, because it does have its' uses and because I have spotted predators and this could help me sleep nights in those times, it serves what it needs to for what we need to protect.
B000VXYV6K This is great either as a small animal type fencing unit or as a starter kit for something bigger. With the wiring and the battery pack provided we were able to create our own, operating barrier that mounts across our privacy fence to help as a deterrent for deer. So far we are really pleased with the adaptability of this product.
B000VXYV6K I put this on hubby's \"to do\" list and after waiting for over a week, I finally bit the bullet and decided to put this together myself. I dread putting stuff together (I thought that was a perk of getting married!). I was surprised that, with careful reading and patience, I was able to do this myself.I was a bit doubtful that this would work but was quite surprised that our dogs who love digging in our garden tried to get into the garden ONCE and since then, they don't even go near it. FINALLY!!! I'm really excited because next year I can go wild in the garden and plant the new things I held off on, knowing the frustration of having the dogs trample through the veggies/herbs.I think it's priced quite nicely and wouldn't hesitate to recommend to anyone. If I can put this together, anyone can!
B000VXYV6K SS-750RPX is simple, effective, easy to install, unless the ground is hard, and ugly. It is good for dogs, which are easy to train and remember, but not as much for cats, if highly agitated, excited, or intent on hunting. The thrill of the chase coupled with the desire to kill may erase any memory of the electric shock. An intensely chasing cat is likely to break through an electric fence, despite the shock. Some cats are easily startled or frightened, and the survival instinct of escaping a threat may push them through the fence far away from the threat & ensuing shock. Once shocked, the cat may not want to come back for being afraid of another shock.
B000VXYV6K Hooked up this electric fence around my garbage cans that something keeps knocking over.  Figured an electrified, bare 120v AC wire would do the job quicker, but I didn't want a bunch of charred critters laying outside.  Using this electric fence, I am absolutely certain that I won't have any charred critters around...even if they took a nap on the wire.The system is pretty easy to setup; it would have been nicer if it would have came with a bit more rebar for each of the plastic fence posts, as they're kind of flimsy and you're just supposed to bury them a couple inches deep.  It's really not very secure to begin with.  Alas I hooked the thing up in a big box around 2 trash cans and a recycle bin.  Nice tight, tense wire was almost invisible unless you were looking for it, and hooked up to the power box, which was hooked up to the ground...plugged it in, and the light started flashing.  BINGO!  Next time something comes to knock over a trash can, *ZAP!*Not so much.Like any man would, I figured I should test it out.  I didn't feel a thing.  Absolutely nothing.  I could have snorted half the wire up my nose and hacked it out of my mouth and not been any worse for the wear.  I checked to make sure nothing was touching to short/ground out - everything was tense, straight, the ground was hooked up correctly...and...maybe I just have remarkably thick skin, I thought to myself.I went to bed able to see the obnoxious flashing light telling me that my trash can was protected.  I woke up to a knocked over trash can, with one of the bags dragged over the wires, bending it quite a bit, and leaving the wires resting nicely on the cold, moist ground.And now the thing never flashes.It certainly didn't work for me.  Re-stringing the wire doesn't work, the fuses aren't burned out, all the connections are fine, it just doesn't work.  If it DID work, I think it'd be a pretty nice little fence based on the easy of installation and price.  Wouldn't recommend...unless wherever you buy it has a generous return policy, just in case.
B000VXYV6K This kit comes with basically everything needed to set-up a small electric fence deterrent including the main unit, wire, stakes etc...however, even though the description indicates a 1 mile range, these are a lot like walkie-talkie radio's...the range is always grossly exaggerated. This is one of the smallest electric fence kits available but as such, is perfect for our needs which is to keep neighborhood cats, raccoon's and opossum from running along the top of our privacy fence.Next, it should be noted that we purchased new stakes to attach to the privacy fence. The shock is light but annoying; a lot like a super-charged static electric shock which should be of no danger to smaller creatures although I'm still a little concerned about birds especially for use on a fence. I've not seen a problem yet but remain alert to the possibility.I'm a big fan of the Havahart products; this is a small but useful kit.
B000VXYV6K I thought this would be great around a front yard flower garden.  It may not be the most attractive thing to look at, but it  will work with Biscuit, our Bishon and our 5 pound Yorkie, Zoey.  .  But for DJ, our 100 pound Golden Retriever it was a whole nother  ballgame.  This is definitely just for small pets.
B0013OX9XW There are a lot of potential claims about this supplement - increases energy, cellular regeneration, muscle energy & recovery, etc. What you have to keep in mind - Jarrow is a company that tries to stay ahead of the trends. There may be one promising study out there, and Jarrow will rush a formula to market. That doesn't make it bad necessarily, I'm just saying that much more research (effectiveness, dosage, etc) are needed on some of these claims.However, while NattoMax may have lots of unanswered questions around it, the basic ingredient Natto has a long history of cardiovascular benefits - circulation, blood pressure, and prevention of blood clots or stroke. That's why I'm taking it, and I think I'm going to keep it permanently on my regimen. The cost is low (only $10/month), the benefits are clinically proven, there is the potential for additional benefits, and there are basically no side effects. So I'm sticking with it.Hope this helps!
B0013OX9XW Nattokinase is one of many enzymes isolated from the fermented food product known as Natt&#333; (boiled soybeans fermented specifically with the bacteria Bacillus subtilis), and it is supposed to help with circulation (blood pressure and possibly clotting disorders).  Since I don't have a clotting disorder, I can't say whether or not it helps with that.  I can, however, state categorically that this didn't help at all with my blood pressure.For those who do find this formula effective, be aware that it is recommended that you stop taking it two weeks before surgery, due to its possible clot dissolving properties.
B0013OX9XW Jarrow Formulas NattoMax contains 100 mg of natto extract derived from fermented soy in each vegetarian capsule.  It contains nattokinase, a proteolytic enzyme produced by the prokaryotic organism Bacillus subtilis during the fermentation process.The safety-sealed bottle that I received has an expiration date of 09/15, about eighteen months from receipt.All of the supplements that I have tried from Jarrow Formulas seem to be of good quality, and this one is no exception.
B0013OX9XW I wanted to try NattoMax to see if it would help at all with my Superficial Thrombophlebitis.  I suffer from varicose veins in the legs with some superficial clotting under the skin on one of my feet. Yep, it is nasty to look at and nerve wracking just knowing I have it there, ready to implode at a moments notice.  YIKES!!So basically, since I am NOT on any Rx blood thinners at the moment, I was hoping that perhaps NattoMax would help to appreciably dissolve the visible clot.  So far , no luck after 2 weeks of one per day with food in the AM.  I can honestly report there have been no noticeable side effects of any kind, but also no actual results yet.  NO gastric problems or bad tastes either so the product, at least for me, seems benign.Perhaps the results I am seeking won't occur quite this quickly and I do plan on giving it a chance with a 60 day course of treatment. For now, 2 weeks have given me no noticeable results. (but no side effects either)  IF NattoMax ends up actually DOING something for my condition I will edit this review. (I am notorious for editing and adding to my reviews)****I am giving this product 3 stars (a Neutral rating) but may raise my rating if I notice any actual visible results from use.
B0013OX9XW I read up on this before placing my order.  NattoMax contains Nattokinase  which is an enzyme that acts like a blood thinner and seems to have a positive effect on the cardiovascular system.  Nattokinase is a by-product of soybean fermentation.The Japanese eat Nattokinase all of the time and it is possible that this is the reason they live so long.  Some people with coronary artery disease with 75% blockage reported only a 25% blockage a few months later taking Nattokinase.I think more research is needed but Nattokinase has been consumed by the Japanese for centuries so it is generally considered safe.I'll put it like this: This is on my Subscribe and Save list in the 90 count.
B0013OX9XW I have been eating Natto my whole life. Natto supports both blood clotting and clot dissolving. This NattoMax has the Vitamin K2 removed and only the Nattokinase remaining. This then is suppose to help the body's own fibrin dissolving mechanisms. I like the function of this supplement and would much rather take it than a patented prescription pill.The freshness and quality of the Jarrow formula seems to be potent and active. I have come to trust Jarrow Formulas and consider them a leading manufacturer.
B0013OX9XW They weren't kidding when they said,&#34;natto is not for everyone. Some find its stickiness and strong smell unpleasant.&#34;  Not only do I wholeheartedly concur with that but traditional natto is made from soy which also is loaded with phytoestrogens, which I certainly want to avoid! * Besides it tastes just awful!They did studies that showed rats with carotid artery blockages when dosed with nattokinase regained 62% of blood flow, where others treated with plasmin only regained j15.8%.Other blood substances helpful to vascular well being were incresaed after ingesting nattokinase!Nattokinase helps keep blood vessels clear because its enzymes have been shown to greatly encourage cardiovascular health by restoring normal blood flow because this formula has the vitamin K removed from it.Again, only 4 stars as it contains magnesium stearate, something that most supplement companies add to their formulas but is counterproductive to good health, arghhhh!
B0013OX9XW The same substance can be found in a Japanese food called natto.Natto is a fermented soybean product. Now I love it. Many do not. It is pungent. Think &#34;stinky cheese&#34;.It's great on noodles with some tamari.However, it's hard to make safely. I use a large yogurt maker to keep the temperature right while the natto innoculent grows over the fresh cooked soybeans. It works most of the time, but there is a high rate of spoilage.That's where NottoMax comes in.Get the same health benefits without the hassle of making natto every week.WebMD reports that it has been used for:*Deep vein thrombosis (DVT). There is some evidence that taking a specific combination product (Flite Tabs) might decrease the chance of getting a blood clot in the legs during long plane flights. This product combines a blend of 150 mg of nattokinase plus pycnogenol. Two capsules are taken 2 hours before the flight and then again 6 hours later.*Heart disease.*Stroke.*Angina.*&#8220;Hardening of the ateries&#8221; (atherosclerosis).*Hemorrhoids.*Poor circulation.*Varicose veins.*Peripheral artery disease (PAD).*Pain.*Fibromyalgia.*Chronic fatigue syndrome.*Endometriosis.*Uterine fibroids.*Muscle spasms.*High blood pressure.*Infertility.*Cancer.*Beriberi.*Other conditions.WebMD notes that more studies need to be done to confirm effectiveness for any of those ailments.Bottom line, Jarrow makes great quality suppliments. If you want to explore nattokinase for any of those ailments, I suggest you get it from Jarrow.
B0013OX9XW I'm very happy about the results I've had since taking this.  I'm especially thankful for the gr
B0013OX9XW Several years ago, during an extended visit to Japan, I discovered natto.  Yuck!  I had the usual American reaction to Natto, spitting it out as fast as possible within the Japanese bounds of good manners.  What I could not have imagined at the time was the almost miraculous effects of natto uncovered in Western laboratories.  Not only does this substance (fermented beans) keep veins and arteries open, but recent research shows that it can also clear areas of clogged calcium and cells.  That's for me.I've been taking this substance with ease only because of the capsules surrounding it.  I cannot say I've experienced any dramatic effects, but research papers I've read indicate a longer time of usage than the three weeks I've been taking it.  I'll be patient because of the laboratory research .
B0013OX9XW It is hard to &#34;rate&#34; the effectiveness of a product as the benefits might not be realized for years. This one looks promising though. Used for centuries in Japan, this seems to help the circulation system that could prevent blood clots. I would like to see more studies done, but Jarrow is a trustworthy manufacturer of supplements, so I can recommend this.
B0013OX9XW I take a variety of supplements, from vitamins to fish oil, krill oil and it seems like everything in-between. Both my parents died pretty young, so I'm doing what I can to break that trend. Part of the plan is heart health.  Reading and researching kept turning up Nattokinase , a natural result of soybean fermentation. Nattokinase is an enzyme that acts like a blood thinner, and many experts think it's good for the cardiovascular system. It's one of those natural things that's been used in the orient for centuries.  Is it doing any good? Who can say - I feel great and I'm still here :-)
B0013OX9XW This is a really interesting heart health supplement.  I could be wrong, but I think this has helped lower my blood pressure a little.  As you can imagine, I am impressed!This product also comes in a bottle with 90 capsules, which actually is much more economical per tablet (at the time of my writing, for about $5 more one can get three times more).
B0013OX9XW This will thin your blood naturally and maybe get rid of your blood clots.  .  So if you're already on a thinner you will probably want to talk to your doctor before starting on Nattomax and maybe get it tested occasionally by your doctor after taking it.  This version of Nattomax has vitamin k removed, so it doesn't affect any other thinners you might be on.  I take one in the morning and one at night.Hoping to get off the doctor prescribed blood thinners permanently.
B0013OX9XW I know the great health benefits of eating natto and have been eating it as often as my wife allows me, since she doesn&#8217;t like the smell.  Now I can get the same benefit by taking this pill without annoying my wife.
B0013OX9XW I have not noticed any negative side effects.  I take this with meals to prevent nausea.  I haven't seen any positive effects yet, but I just started to take this.  I will update my review at a later date, but so far it appears to be a great product.
B0013OX9XW Where to begin? Well, go read the description and decide from there. This supplement seems to provide quite a number of health benefits all rolled into one convenient product. Like all Jarrow Formulas products, this one is consistent and appears to be of excellent quality. There is little odor, no unpleasant or lingering taste, and it is very easy to swallow. Unlike most Jarrow products, this one causes mild stomach upset if taken on an empty stomach, so I'd advise to always take these with some food if you have a sensitive stomach.
B0013OX9XW I've been taking these Jarrow Formulas NattoMax supplements for about 3 weeks.  Prior to being offered this product by the Amazon Vine program, I had never heard of this particular supplement.My extremities are constantly cold, even in warm weather.  I often sit at my desk at work with lightweight gloves on, and I usually sleep with heavy socks.  In the last couple of weeks, I've noticed a big improvement with both of those problems.  It's too soon to tell whether it's a coincidence, or this supplement helping.  The price of these is fairly reasonable, and I plan on ordering another bottle of them.
B0013OX9XW Jarrow is so very reliable with their supplements.  The quality and reliability is always there.  This is a very good Natto supplement.
B0013OX9XW Jarrow Formulas NattoMax is the non-nasty way to consume the health benefits of natto. I apologize if I insult anyone's taste for natto.I cannot tell the affects it has had internally, but I feel about the same. I still think it is worth taking because of the health-related claims of natto.If I could figure out one more way to use natto in a sentence...
B0013OX9XW I am not sure if it was this product or not, but my blood pressure is in better control when taking this.  Did;t notice other benefits and don;t know if it would effect everyone the same.
B0013OX9XW When I was in massage therapy school, I had to take nutrition classes.  My instructor was a huge fan of nattokinase but, as far as I knew, the only way to get the benefit was by eating natto.  I am an adventurous spirit, but I could never get past the sliminess of natto.  YUCK.  So this was an interesting alternative.  I am very healthy and do not take blood thinners, but I do have issues with varicose veins.  Maybe it is a placebo effect, but I honestly feel like I have less pain when I take this.  Great supplement for anyone with blood or circulatory concerns and is definitely easier to take than the real food alternative.
B0013OX9XW The explanation of the mechanism by which this Nattokinase supplement works is a bit technical, and all I would be doing is parroting what I've read elsewhere . . . so I won't.  I do recommend looking at the write-up on the Amazon Product Description Page.  I have read that particular propaganda on this supplement and am positively influenced.As an aging male (quite common nowadays), I have the typical issues with high blood pressure  and deteriorating circulation.  I also have a family history involving clotting and circulation issues.  I try to minimize, and eliminate where possible, use of prescription drugs, and taking targeted supplements has been a real success in this quest.  After having read the benefits and studies on Nattokinase, taking this supplement is a no-brainer for me.So in addition to taking my array of supplements, which saliently include Omega 3's for circulatory vessel health, and red yeast rice for cholesterol control, I am adding this Nattomax for anti-clotting and circulation enhancement.  Presently, my blood lab numbers are great and I've never felt better.  Starting NattoMax this week, I've had no observed side effects.  So, we'll see how this works out over a period of months.As far as the vendor here, I'm a long time Jarrow Formulas user, and have found their supplements to be of consistent high quality and supported by a good foundation of available information.I'll re-open this review with any important updates, most especially to report anything negative that emerges.
B0013OX9XW I'll be honest, I'd never heard of Natto before. I read about its reported benefits as a natural blood thinner and possibly preventative to Alzheimer's Disease (which runs in the family) and decided, what the hey, why not. Nearly 30 days later and I'm still alive without any negative reactions to the supplements. I couldn't say that I'm any better, but I gather that it is more of a preventativeThe only reported benefit I can mention, and this may be a coincidence, but I am usually a very cold-natured person and since I started NattoMax I feel less inclined to walk around with a blanket everywhere or two hoodies to keep warm. I'm still cold natured, mind you, but less so. Possibly this is due to the circulation benefits of Natto...or the fact that the weather is getting warmer.In any case, the capsules are small and easy to swallow. Take one a day with a meal. I haven't noticed any upset stomach or other negative signs and maybe a few benefits. If you think this will help you, I say go for it.
B0013OX9XW This product helped the person I asked to sample this item by preventing blood clots.  It seems a more delicate solution than other medications on the market.
B0013OX9XW Jarrow Formulas NattoMax, 100 mg, is doing a great job of improving my circulation. My hands and feet have always been so cold. They feel like I should be wearing gloves and socks all the time. Except in the hottest weather I can't go without sock on or even sleep without socks on. My hands and feet feel warmer now and if I touch someone, they aren't jumping when I touch them because my hands are so cold. That definitely says that what it's doing for
B0013OXA5Y I've been taking these supplements because the anti-oxidant power of pomegranates are said to have anti-aging benefits as well as aiding skin cell regeneration. These vitamins are easy to take, have no taste and are less expensive than the juice. I believe that my skin has benefitted from taking these in addition to DHA supplements and will continue to take them everyday.
B0013OXA5Y It's nice to be able to enjoy the (cardiovacular, cellular and anti-oxidant) benefits of Pomegranates without having to worry about cutting through the leathery fruit, geting red juice all over the place (I eat pomegranates over newspapers) chomping on those bitter white seeds, or paying a bundle for the pure juice.The Recommended serving size of  Jarrow Formulas Pomguard is One capsule one or two times a day -- I take 2 or 3 at a time, just once -- I don't take this daily, and I don't believe there is an over-dosing problem with that extra amount, as I have in the past glugged a good share of those pure pomegranate juices, and enjoyed them (except for the astringent action in my stomach from too much of a good thing from those juices).My ONLY concern is the ingredient making up the  Jarrow Formulas Pomguard capsule -\"hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose\" - that is a Polymer, (also used in eyedrops) and not something natural. Aren't there capsules that are made from regular cellulose? Shouldn't that be used instead of the hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose????I guess I can email those concerns of mine to Jarrow and see what they say.
B0013OXA5Y Antioxidants are considered to be pretty good for your body, and pomegranates are a good source of antioxidants.  However, pomegranates are also pretty expensive and difficult to eat, requiring a lot of effort to get the edible seeds out of the fruit.Jarrow has created this supplement from pomegranate extract.  You get the beneficial antioxidants from the pomegranate without the expense or effort required to prepare the fruit for eating.  (And, for those of you up on your Greek myth, no annual trips to visit Hades in the underworld as a result of eating pomegranate seeds!)If you're looking to add antioxidants to your diet, this is a good way to do it.  Recommended.
B0013OXA5Y I used to drink POMWonderful juice daily. Then I realized that PomWonderful, while claiming to have a lot of antioxidants, also has an exorbitant amount of sugar (something like 28 g in one serving).The benefits of pomegranate are desirable for antioxidants as well as cardiofunction, so these vitamins come in handy. I take them as a vitamin C supplement.;, i.e., instead of taking vitamin C.The pill itself is about medium size but easy to swallow. I prefer wrapping it in food and literally taking it \"with food\" for easier swallowing and digestion.The pills are great, but as with any vitamins, try to get as much of the real thing as you can, and only tak the vitamins when the real fruit is unavailable (not in season / you are on the road).These are vegan/vegetarian safe, if you are worried about allergens.
B0013OXA5Y I gave this five stars because I love jarrow Formulas and it is one of three top brands of supplements I usually buy. I am a supplement freak and easily take at least 15 different ones a day. I can't say that I know for sure any of them do anything except for Methyl B12 which I can feel, vitamin C, fiber, and D3. This one, with pomguard, Jarrow's proprietary brand of pomegranite, is one that I just have to use on faith.I am sure you know the hype about pomegranite so I won't rehash it here except to say that it had it's day a few years back as the antioxidant du jour. I, like many others, bought and drank POM, pomegranite juice, for a while until I realized that it didn't seem to do much except add calories to my diet.These little pills go down easily, and I like knowing that just in case they really do help prevent aging and illness, I am being protected by them. Whether you feel the need to add pomegranite antioxidants to your daily regimen is up to you, but if you do, you can't beat Jarrow Formulas as a trusted brand.
B0013OXA5Y I hear a lot about pomegranates' antioxidant properties, but I do not have enough of pomegranate in my diet.  I do not buy pomegranates often because they are only tasty during the season, but then they are quite expensive. The pomegranate juice is available but is expensive and causes me to have a heartburn.  These pills seem to be a good alternative.  They are a good value for the amount of antioxidants they provide and they do not cause heartburn.  That said, after taking this supplement for some time, I do not notice any difference in how I feel, so, hopefully, it is working.
B0013OXA5Y If you're looking for a healthy antioxidant, pomegranate's a great choice.  They're high in antioxidant value (measured in ORACs-Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity) and are VERY beneficial to the cardiovascular system.  I'm using PomGuard for reducing free radical damage; I had to have multiple medically necessary CAT scans & want to limit the long-range after-effects as much as possible, so I actively look for concentrated sources of antioxidants like this.Capsules are so much easier to take than pomegranate juice and have a lot less sugar; these are reasonably priced and personally, I trust Jarrow's quality control--it's one of my favorite go-to brands.I don't know if it's a placebo effect or not, but I take mine about 30 minutes before a treadmill workout and find that it's an energy-booster, giving me more stamina (I can easily walk longer at faster speeds).  I also like this because it's a \"whole food\" antioxidant.  I think in our modern environment, we're bombarded by so many oxidators (indoor and outdoor air pollution, for example) that it's absolutely essential to take a full range of antioxidants and fight back where we can. Nature knows best; I like these!
B0013OXA5Y I love that PomGuard only has real Pomegranates in it, and not any unnatural ingredients.  Since I can only find Pomegranates during a few months of the year, I can rarely benefit from this fruit and its antioxidants.  I love PomGuard because I don't have to worry about that, and I get fruit antioxidants every day of the year.
B0013OXA5Y Many times when I use a supplement I get heartburn or end up with a bad taste in my mouth later on.  These didn't do that.  I used the entire bottle in full, and I didn't notice any visible astonishing benefits, but those aren't necessarily visible anyway.  It's to help cardiovascular function and to be an antioxidant...I can only assume that it achieved that.On another note, there are no contraindications or side effects of note (checking Web MD) and these are organic and vegetarian.  Since pomengranite seems to promise so many health benefits, I'm planning on continuing to use these.  They are pure pomengranite and much easier to consume than with fresh fruit....
B0013OXA5Y Pomegranates is by far one of the most important fruits you can eat.Here in South Florida, we're fortunate enough to have a fairly regular supply of Pomegranates in our supermarkets most of the year.  And, usually one Pomegranate is about $1.50 each.  And, I absolutely love the juice that sits on those seeds.One of my sisters is into health-related products and used to sell those Pomegranate juices for almost $10/ bottle for a 1-litre container.  She swears by its heart-healthy benefits.  I couldn't agree more.***Pomeguard is a dietary supplement and a good thing to have if you're not in an area where you can get fresh pomegranates to eat. The pills are small and easily digestible.No supplement can take the place of eating fresh fruits and vegetables, but this supplement is great to have.
B0013OXA5Y Pomegrante juice is tart and not very appealing.  It is also expensive.Fresh pomegrantes are a mess to prepare.  I usually avail myself of frozen pomegrante seeds. Not all in my family enjoy their crunchiness as I do.This antioxidant formula may be just the boost to our own personal regimen.Time will tell but for now...good product!As always, everyone should research their own medical issues before taking anything that may interfere with meds or existing conditions.
B0013OXA5Y Pomegranates have been used medicinally since ancient times.It's believed to have antioxidant effects.Pomegranate extract may help in heart failure, blood pressure, high cholesterol and for a very, very broad range of ailments.Topically, pomegranates has been noted to help inflammation of hemorrhoids and is also used to eliminate parasites.These Jarrow tablets contain 100% pomegranate extract from California and I believe they are very high quality.
B0013OXA5Y Pomegrantes have become quite the rage.  Touted for their antioxidant benefits, the fruit and their juice have become prohibitively expensive. Moreover it is challenging to extract the seeds.This supplement contains 100% pomegrante extract making it easy and affordable to enjoy the advantages without the mess and expense. The pills are easy to swallow and I noticed no side effects.  As with most supplements of this type, they are prophylactic and their benefits are hard to guage.My experience with Jarrow has been positive. Their supplments are high quality and their customer service people are responsive. If you are looking to incorporate the goodness of pomegrante into your diet, this is an easy way to do so.
B0013OXA5Y I like shifting around the sources for antioxidants in my diet. I never mind buying blackberries, raspberries, or strawberries when they are on sale...but beyond those most of the fruit sources of antioxidants get pretty pricey. This is why I like the Jarrow PomGuard product. I never take these regularly but do take them on days or during a week where I'm not have berries or a fruit juice. Despite their price tag, these are still a better buy than Pomegranate juice and provide the same benefits.With several Jarrow supplements, I have experienced what another reviewer referenced in terms of taste. I don't mind a quick bitter taste, but if you let these linger on your tongue too long before swallowing, you might need more than one glass of water to wash them down.
B0013OXA5Y Pomegranate, good.  Expensive, not good.  Extracts in pill form for POTENTIAL health benefits, cheaper...good.  Pomegranate has been consumed by many nations for thousands of years, by both men and women with no ill effects.  As a supplement, just be aware of the fact that it may raise salivary testosterone.Suggested UsageTake 1 capsule 1 or 2 times per day after meals or as directed by your qualified health care consultant.NOTE: If you have a medical condition or are taking medications, consult your health care practitioner before using this product.Other IngredientsSilcon dioxide. Capsule consists of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose.No wheat, no gluten, no soybeans, no dairy, no egg, no fish/shellfish, no peanuts/tree nuts.Suitable for vegetarians/vegans.
B0013OXA5Y A normal sized clear capsule, Pomguard is easy to swallow, doesn't smell strange, leaves no after taste and has none of the awful and sometimes dangerous side effects of pharmaceuticals.I decided to try this supplement when my last check-up showed that my cholesterol was beginning to head in the wrong direction and I didn't want to take prescription medications to lower cholesterol because of the awful side effects other family members have suffered from taking Statins.As with any supplement, until I see my Physician for blood tests, I will not be able to tell if this has had any positive effects but I will keep taking it in the hopes that it will help lower my cholesterol and with all the anti-oxidants Pomegranate is known to contain it certainly can't hurt to try.
B0013OXA5Y Deciding on a supplement involves around two major decisions. First what supplement do I want, how much of the active ingredient, supporting ingredients, fillers, etc. So what is in it.But the second one that we don't always think about is who is the company? Do you trust them? Will they put in what they see they do at the level they claim and will they keep out what they say they are keeping out? This is my second Jarrow product and I believe from my experiences and other reviews that they are a company to trust. I mostly take Andrew Lessman vitamins for the same reason. They cost more but I believe they have in them what they claim to.As for this itself. If you are considering it you have some interest in pomegranates. I seems to be a very good antioxidant. I am taking this with my Lessmans. On days I take them I feel energetic the whole day through, focused, and in a good mood. I can't separate this one out.But I can say this is a good company and that is very important when considering a supplement. And Jarrow should be on your list to consider.
B0013OXA5Y PomGuard by Jarrow Formulas is a decent supplement.  It consists of capsules containing pomegranate fruit extract from 100% California Pomegranates - NO synthetic ellagic acid.  Other IngredientsThe only other ingredient is silcon dioxide. The capsule is made from hydroxypropylmethylcellulose.As with other Jarrow Formula products, PomGuard contains no wheat, gluten, soybeans, dairy, egg, fish/shellfish, or peanuts/tree nuts.Each capsule contains 425mg of pomegranate extract and there are  60 capsules in the bottle.Pomegranate is an antioxidant, and is believed to support cardiovascular and arterial functions.  Of course, as an antioxidant, it can reduce free radical damage.Jarrow Formulas' recommended dose is 1 to 2 capsules per day.  The extract contains the whole fruit, that is peel, membrane, juice and seed.NOTE: Although the active ingredient in the capsules is pomegranate fruit extract, please keep in mind this looks and smells like pretty much any other gelatin capsule product.  If you are expecting something chewable, sweet, etc. this IS NOT it.The capsules are average size and not difficult to swallow.This is a good supplement if you like to take antioxidants and/or are a believer in some of the benefits attributed to pomegranate.
B0013OXA5Y I've taken various antioxidant type supplements over the past year or so and I switch between brands once in awhile to see which is more effective. As far as the Jarrow brand I've been using their supplements for a couple of years now.I like to work-out a lot and to prevent free-radical damage I take some type of anti-oxidant supplement right after my workouts. I've been taking this for a couple of weeks now and have not experienced any side-effects. Good supplement with high-quality ingredients.
B0013OXA5Y I'm a believer that we're best off eating a wide variety of foods when possible so that we get a variety of different helpful vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and all of that. Usually eating actual food is better, but pomegranate has a good reputation for being an exceptionally healthy choice and isn't necessarily available in fresh form all year long (around here I only see it a month or so a year) so I can see how supplementing with an extract could make sense.Unless you're trying to help a really specific condition, though, this is the kind of supplement I'd tend to mix in every few days rather than as an every day thing. Since I tend to think it's probably best to get a variety of antioxidants, I wouldn't want to fall into the habit of relying on the same pill every day to supply them. I can definitely see where there could be a fair bit of value, though, in using it as an extra source of them a few times a week.The pills are a pretty standard supplement size and just little clear capsules holding red powder. No awful smells or anything that makes them unusually hard to take. If you really wanted, I suppose there's no reason you couldn't pop the capsule open to mix the powder into something for someone who can't/won't swallow pills well.
B0013OXA5Y Pomegranates are supposed to be very good for you.  Supposedly it is also a symbol of fertility and powerful thing to put in your body.That being said, pomegranates are very expensive to buy at the  supermarket and are messy to eat.  The liquid forms may be loaded with sugar if not the pure juice version.So this is a great way to get the nutrients in a easy to ingest format.
B0013OXA5Y Pomegranates are marketed as a superfruit. Other superfruits like acai and dragonfruit are all the rage now and pomegranate seems to have taken a backseat. They are high in healthful compounds like polyphenols, which is also found in tea and coffee.One capsule supplies 425mg. Take 1 or 2 capsules a day after meals.
B0013OXA5Y Pomegranate juice is awfully expensive nowadays, and this supplement contains derivatives of pomegranate that are just as beneficial as the juice.  Pomegranate supports a healthy cholesterol level, acts as a powerful antioxidant in our bodies, maintains a healthy blood platelet level, helps with high blood pressure, stimulates collagen synthesis (great for skin!), and more.  Jarrow has done it again.  I have lots of their formulations and consider Jarrow to be my favorite brand for supplements.  Always high quality.  Highly recommended.
B0013OXA5Y Pomegranate is definitely good for you and especially if you get the fresh product either in full fruit form or juice. I've been drinking the juice on a regular basis and it's a great, healthy replacement for sugary drinks and makes me feel like I'm living a healthy life. I've become a pomegranate addict!!! This is a good substitute and simply contains an extract of pomegranate. I have to say though, I really don't notice a big difference in how my body feels when I take this, I just know it's good for me :-)
B0013OXA5Y Pomegranates are renowned for their anti-oxidant abilities but who enjoys eating a pomegranate?  They are tart and filled with seeds and are more trouble than they are worth.  Pomegranate juice is very expensive.  These tablets therefore are easy to swallow, lack that tart aftertaste, and still provide the benefits of the pomegranate.I take one in the morning after my coffee.  While I can not profess a long life or newborn physical abilities, I know I am taking in the benefits of the pomegranate daily.
B0013OXA5Y I have enjoyed pomegranates since the 1980's (back when they were called \"Chinese apples\"). I can usually get a decent deal on them where I live, but they can be very messy and time consuming to prep. I don't like the commercial juice, as it is way too sweet for me. These supplements are a pretty decent way to get the antioxidants and other health benefits from pomegranates. I would not suggest these over eating the actual fruit though unless pomegranates are hard to find or expensive in your area. Check with your health care provider before taking these to make sure they do not interfere with any medications you are taking. The pills are fairly small and not hard to swallow.
B0013OXA5Y I have not tried any of Jarrow's brand of multivitamins. However when I saw the pomguard tablets and read what benefits the vitamins provided I had to check them out. I really like the idea that they are all natural. I am particular about what I put in my body especially when it comes to vitamins.The tablets are easy to swallow but they do get some getting used to. What I mean is that there is some bitter taste to them. This might be because the tablets are more compact and concentrated whereas when you buy the pom juice it still has a little bitter taste but it is not as concentrated. Overall, I would say this is a good product for your money.
B0013OXA5Y These are fairly large capsules filled with 100% powdered pomegranate extract. The powder is a purple-brown and has a pleasant scent and no discernible flavor when swallowing. I am taking one of these daily along with Jarrow Formulas Quercetin. I hope both together make a potent antioxidant combination.
B0013OXA5Y I would like to buy a lot more pomegranate juice but since it's such a popular juice, it's so expensive and the jars are small! I like this supplement because it's a cheaper alternative to buying bottles and bottles of pomegranate juice and you get the antioxident powers of pomegranites in an easy to swallow supplement.Pomguard supplements a re easy to take and the pills are not too large. I've not had any indigestion or heartburn from this supplement. Pomegranites have been used in healthy diets for a long time, but eating pomegranites can be time consuming and they can be messy and even stain clothes. For many of the benefits of eating pomegranites, I now take Pomguard in a easy to swallow supplement. I make sure and take any supplements with food and not on an empty stomach because they tend to upset my stomach without food. Food also helps to deliver the nutrients throughout your body. Pom juice and fruit juices contain high quanities of sugar and that's anothe plus of taking a supplement such as Pomguard. Jarrow makes high quality, innovative supplements.
B0013OXA5Y The phenolic extracts included from pomegranates have free radical scavenging properties. This helps prevent more diseases and bad conditions than I can cite. Currently there are about a dozen separate trials registered with the National Institute of Health to determine whether the expectations of pomegranates can be validated.I believe this product deserves 5 stars because it's not just extracts from the juice. In fact, the micronutrients in pomegranate seeds, which is included in these tablets, are tremendous and have antibacterial properties.
B0013OXA5Y For those of us who see improved health with supplements, having to take three or six capsules a day, particularly in divided doses, is a real pain.  Thus I am delighted to be able to get what should be a therapeutic dosage in a single daily capsule.  Kudos to Jarrow.I am taking this supplement to lower bad cholesterol.  My doctor wants to put me on cholesterol-lowering medicine and I am resisting.  So I started taking this supplement two weeks ago with no side effects. I don't like the flavor of pomegranate juice so this is a better way for me to get it into my system.My annual physical is several months away and I will continue the supplement until then.  In the absence of a blood test, I have no way of knowing if it is useful.
B0013OXA5Y My mother says Pomegranate is good for your heart.  So...as far as I can tell it's helping me.  I guess it's better than eating beans.
B0013OXA5Y I got this product because i heard great things about it. And i was getting tired of my acai juices. So this is nice to get teh benefits with an easy to swallow pill.
B0013OXA5Y PomGuard is a pomegranate extract and the health benefits of pomegranates are wonderful. The PomGuard pill itself is a medium sized extract filled capsule. It's ok to take. I have a little trouble with the capsules going down as smooth as a regular tablet but it's not that bothersome.I didn't have any side effects or upset stomach with it.
B0013OXA5Y These are easy to swallow and have just the slightest herbal after taste.  They are good for your heart, and there doesn't seem to be any cons to taking these.  I can't say I see any instant results, as I don't have any heart issues.  However, it doesn't hurt to take these.  We could all use extra anti-oxidants in our diet.  I recommend it if you don't get enough of these nutrients daily.
B0013OXA5Y It's fairly accepted that pomegranate is a great anti-oxidant and this is a very convenient way to get that into your diet.  The active ingredient is 425mg of pomegranate fruit extract, with the only other ingredient being silicon dioxide.  It states that the pomegranates are from California.  It doesn't state the amount or percentage of ellagic acid, but it does state that there is no synthetic ellagic acid.  These are in capsule form and have a pleasant smell and a reddish brown color (I've used another brand that had an objectionable smell and taste).  I highly recommend this product.
B0013OXA5Y My husband uses this and we trust the Jarrow name. I don't like to buy brands i have never heard of just because they are cheaper.
B0013OXA5Y Jarrow FormulasPomguard 425mg, 60 TabletsI've always been a big pomegranate fan - they're one of those foods like salads or kale that just make me feel good when I eat them. In recent years many health claims have been made about the health benefits of pomegranates and their antioxidant chemicals, how they contribute to cardiovascular health and help regulate blood pressure. I don't doubt it, although I do wonder is products like this isolate the beneficial phytonutrients from specific plants can ever really replace the benefits of eating the plants themselves, but PomGuard pitches itself as a more holistic product, including all the phytonutrients (or many of them) found in the pomegranate fruit, not just a few separate chemicals thought to have health benefits.My experience with PomGuard is limited, but seems good - I've taken it for about two weeks and felt a notable uptick in what I think of as a citric/fruit feeling, the sort of healthy, energetic burst you feel after eating a grapefruit or lemon.  It wasn't as strong a feeling as if I'd eaten some real, live pomegranate, but it was good enough, and definitely better than when I drink pomegranate juice, which has always seemed a little too sugar-heavy. (I'm not big on juices in general now, after finding out about their astronomical glycemic index and how bad they are for blood sugar levels -- much better to eat the whole fruit or, in this case, a supplement version.)  This product is certainly worth trying, particularly if you have dietary restrictions such as diabetes, but still would like to receive some of the health benefits of this potent fruit.
B0013OXA5Y Pomegranates are already well established for their healthy benefits: A powerful antioxidant, heart health, nourishes skin, and is supposed to be a great inhibitor of women troubles (PMS, menopause issues, ITUs, etc.)Jarrow formulas is a very affordable and easily absorbed product as Pom-products can be rather pricey, Jarrow gets my vote for reliable products that are easily digestible and affordable.
B0013OXA5Y Well packaged, fresh, and intact pills. Good way to sup without getting the sugar found in the juice, which is also expensive. The real fruit is not bad, but is messy. So having something in extract form is nice and Jarrow is a company I trust. No side effects for this product for me. 425mg of extract per pill.
B0013OXA5Y I have been switching back and forth between blueberry and black raspberry antioxidant supplements.  It was nice to switch things up by trying PomGuard.Jarrow is one of my favorite supplement manufacturers.  I trust the products and search for their brands first when looking for a specific supplement.I not experienced any bad side effects to these supplements.  No stomach upset and that is my biggest issue.  I finished the bottle and all was well.Current price point is excellent.  If you are in the market for an anti-oxidant or a supplement for cardiovascular health, I would give Jarrow's PomGuard a try.
B0013OXA5Y Grown in California, USA - WINNER!I take it for my 67 year old cartilage and for LDL cholesterol (see below).LOVE that is is PURE extract and nothing else but capsules.Keeper!Cholesterol can't dissolve in the blood. It has to be transported to and from the cells by carriers called lipoproteins.  LDL, is known as \"bad\" cholesterol. HDL, is known as \"good\" cholesterol.When too much LDL (bad) cholesterol circulates in the blood, it can slowly build up in the inner walls of the arteries that feed the heart and brain. It can form plaque (thick, hard deposit) that narrows the arteries making them less flexible; heart attack or stroke can result.
B0013OXA5Y Jarrow makes some excellent products, and is thoughtful in creating products like this that provide all the benefits of pure ingredients, and suitable for vegetarians and those with specific allergies. According to the label it contains no wheat, no gluten, so soybeans, no egg, no dairy, no fish/shellfish and no peanuts/tree nuts. It costs a bit more than some bargain brands, but you don't have to worry about additives or ingredients (like gelatin capsules) made from animal products.
B0013OXA5Y I really like Jarrow Formula's products, and PomGuard is one of the good ones. Pomegranate has many health benefits, many of the same benefits you get from the ever-popular Acai. It is full of antioxidants, which helps eliminate free radicals from the body. It is also supposed to support cardiovascular function, which I really need right now. The capsules aren't hard to swallow, and you only have to take one once or twice a day. It never hurts to start taking something that's good for your health!
B0013OXA5Y I am a believer in the benefits of the pomegranate, but really do not have the budget to be constantly buying fruits.  I found this to be a great little supplement that gives a fair substitute (though of course not perfect) of eating the fruit--I feel about as good as I do when I am actually eating it.  The pills are quite small and easy to take.  All in all, a great way to get a nutrition boost.
B0013OXA5Y Love this great Jarrow supplement that provides antioxidents and heart healthy formula. Everyone loves the great healing properties of Pomegranate, but some may not like the taste of the juice. While some of the juices are not all pomegranate and the cost can be prohibitive too. Here is a reasonably priced solution. Pomegranate in an easy to swallow capsule.
B0013OXA5Y I'm not entirely sure how to review this product, since I'm not authorized to conduct double-blind clinical trials on human subjects to look for measurable health benefits. It has no particular taste, which is too bad, because pomegranates are delicious as well as lovely. But, since the real thing is expensive and not always in season, I suppose at least I'm getting the antioxidants from the capsules. The capsules are vegan, which is a plus if you don't consume animal products.
B0013OXA5Y I feel much better after taking this supplement. I have not check anything, so I don't know whether something is better than before, but my feeling has been improved.
B0013OXA5Y Jarrow's PomGuard is a product made solely from different parts of the pomegranate, a fruit universally championed for centuries as a healing aid. Many cultures through time have used it as a kind of all-purpose medicine cabinet, from the Greeks and Romans to any number of aboriginal cultures. It's been shown that some of those old guys knew a thing or two that conventional collegiate training didn't deduce. This is apparently the case with pomegranates and anything derived from them. PomGuard incorporates all areas of the fruit, which promotes antioxidation, healthy cholesterol, healthy platelet production, good blood pressure, and something which initially alarmed me called 'apoptosis' (programmed death) - which turns out to be the proper programming of cell death in preparation for new cell production and growth.
B0013OXA5Y I've been reading about the benefits of antioxidants a lot lately. Pretty much every book about health talks about how antioxidants counteract the free radicals floating around your system that can cause cancer. These free radicals are in foods that most Americans eat far too much of, such as polyunsaturated fatty acids, packaged foods, and fried foods.There's no denying that pomegranates are trendy right now. But are they the best antioxidant available? It's written on the bottle that pomegranates contain a wide range of polyphenolic compounds including ellagic acid, anthocyanins, and ellagitannins. I did a quick internet search for \"types of polyphenols\" to find out more about the polyphenols found in pomegranates.Ellagic acid has been shown from preliminary laboratory evidence to have anticancer properties, but there is not yet any clear evidence from clinical studies showing that for sure. It may also protect your cardiovascular system from plaque formation and stiffening of the arteries.Anthocyanins are said to be part of the reason that red wine drinkers in France and Italy have lower rates of coronary heart disease. It may also have anti-inflammatory properties.Unfortunately, I found some conflicting information about polyphenols when researching \"risks of polyphenols\". For one, certain polyphenols may have carcinogenic effects or may interfere with thyroid hormone biosynthesis. This is particularly true in the case of soy isoflavones, but may also be true for other polyphenols. In addition, the consumption of polyphenols may inhibit iron absorption. Lastly, polyphenols may interact with certain pharmaceutical drugs and enhance their effects. That would give me pause if I was taking any type of prescription drug. While none of this has been proven in clinical studies, there's enough of a concern that I would only personally take a polyphenol supplement for a specific reason, not necessarily as an everyday thing just for long-term preventative benefits.These pills from Jarrow brand are in a standard capsule shape with powder inside. When you open them up, they have a very bitter flavor such as that of concentrated cranberries. There is no discernible odor, and they are as easy to swallow as any other standard gelcap.
B0013OXA5Y My health care provider is NUTS about pomegranates and wants me to have half of one every day, but what a hassle! Pomegranate juice is so much easier, and has all the benefits, (except fiber) but WOW it's expensive - even more than the fruit! So here's the answer - PomGuard - a simple, easy to take, high potency PILL! What could be better? Recommended.
B0013OXA5Y Pomegrantes are all the rage in health news right now. They have lots of healthy antioxidants and are great for heart health and other things. I love pomegranates and wish I could eat enough of them to get the fantastic benefits.Unfortunately for me, where I live poms are very expensive. If you can find them, they are less than fresh and appealing. I have tried adding pomegranate juice but that is also expensive. So I was glad to try Jarrow's PomGaurd. It smells a little unappealing. But the pills are easy to take. I did not experience any stomach upset. This is a great less expensive way to get the benefits without trying to eat a four dollar dessicated pomegranate every day.
B0013OXA5Y The Jarrow Formulas Pomguard 425mg, 60 Tablets is a great supplement to get your daily intakes of pomegranates even when it is not available or in season in your particular location. Pomegranates, as everyone who is into fruits, is considered as one of the \"superfruits\" because of the varied and tremendous amounts of nutrients that can be derived from eating this fruit. It contains compounds which supports cardio health by lowering cholesterol, maintaining an ideal blood pressure and helps prevents or minimize arterial blockages in the heart. It also contains a good amount of antioxidants which inhibits the development of some cancers. Since this is a tropical fruit, it is mostly available here in the midwest during the summer where I take advantage of eating a lot of this fruit while it is seasonally available. With the Pomguard, a tablet a day, assures you of getting the full nutrional benefits of Pomegranates all year round. Very happy with this supplement and will be making this a part of my daily supplemental intake. Highly recommended!
B0013OXA5Y Here is a easy way to get the benefits of pomegranates, which for me are only available at certain times of the year, and I find the juice drinks to expensive.This is a capsule type with dry fill, even though website lists as a tablet. Taken once a day, I have no problems taking this one, no upset. Happy with product. 60 day supply.
B0013OXA5Y This dietary suppliment from Jarrow is a nice source of antioxidents.Each bottle contains 60 capsules.Contains 100% California Pomegranate fruit extract.
B0013OXA5Y With a family medical history that includes Alzheimer's, cancer, and heart disease, I've been taking antioxidants for several years, including pomegranate extracts, juices, and teas. I've taken other Jarrow products, so I had no problem with changing to Jarrow Pomgard capsules. Most of the other pomegranate supplements that I've tried weren't always clear on what parts of the fruit were used, but Jarrow's formula includes the whole fruit extract - juice, peel, seed, and membrane. That's the only way to know that you're getting all the benefits of the pomegranate.I've done a lot of personal research into the alleged benefits of taking pomegranate supplements, and it's an impressive list. If only a few of the claimed benefits are realized, then it's well worth taking.
B0013OXA5Y Pomegranate has so many health benefits but unfortunately I really don't like the taste of the juice. Also, a lot of fruit juices have a lot of sugar which I try to avoid. Therefore a capsule such as this one--100% pomegranate extract and nothing else--is a great thing for me. Both my husband and I take this capsule for it's antioxidant properties and to help improve cardiovascular function.This capsule isn't too big in size and doesn't have a funny taste when you swallow it. You only have to take one or two a day which isn't bad at all. I also try to take a flaxseed capsule for cardiovascular health but that capsule is so much bigger in size and is actually rather difficult to swallow. I'm not great at taking pills so i'm glad that this PomGuard capsule isn't overly large.I'm very happy with this product.
B0013OXA5Y The label indicates Pomegranates are loaded with anti-oxidants for cardiovascular health, however, one of my mentors who was raised in the Asian culture shared the wisdom of consuming pomegranates for urinary tract health. Previously I was often dealing with UTIs but since I began consuming more pomegranates and pomegranate based supplements, I've rarely experienced UTIs and now they are much easier to deal eliminate them when one begins, they no longer gain a strong foothold as before. I am impressed with the quality found in all the various Jarrow Formula supplements I have sampled. The bottle I received from Amazon had approximately 18 months remaining.Per the label:Serving Size 1 Capsule  Servings per Container  60Pomegranate Extract  425 mgOther ingredients: silicon dioxide. Capsule consists of hydroxyproylmethylcellulose.No wheat, no gluten, no soybeans, no dairy, no egg, no fish/shellfish, no peanuts/tree nuts.Suitable for vegetarians/vegans.Usage: Take 1 capsule 1 or 2 times per day, after meals, or as directed by your qualified health care consultant.  Note: If you have a medical condition or are taking medications, consult your health care practitioner before using this product.  ... derived from 100 % California Pomegranates, contains a wide range of polyphenolic compounds including ellagic acid, anthocyanins and ellagitannins.  ... NO synthetic ellagic acid.
B0013OXA5Y I usually pick up some pomegranate juice once in a while for its health benefits (and i like the taste), but it is so expensive.  These tablets contain 425mg of pomegranate extract and are easy to swallow.
B0013OXA5Y I'm a definite believer in adding antioxidants to your diet. I also like facial products with antioxidants. I drink teas with antioxidants. I try to eat a \"rainbow\" of foods, and include various forms of nutritional antioxidants daily.I know I don't eat enough fruit, and I don't have the patience to eat actual pomegranites. So this is kind of a treat for my body.On the days I know I'm going to eat poorly - as on holidays, when traveling, or if I'm just super busy - then I make sure to grab antioxidant supplements.Pomegranite is one of the top \"faddish\" antioxidants, but some research shows it's a good one, up there with blueberries, acai, red wine, green tea, and vitamins A and C.The bottle recommends taking these after - not during - a meal.The pills come in a clear cellulose form of capsule, containing a reddish chunky powder. The bottle smells vaguely of fruit when you sniff the inside.The pills are 3/4s of an inch and are easy to swallow.There are sixty pills in a bottle and the serving size is one pill. As a two- month supply, this is a pretty good deal. I can stretch this out a bit by changing around which antioxidant pills I take that day. I try to mix it up with other antioxidants supplements, and if I have a big fruit day, I leave it at that.Recommended as part of an array of antioxidant sources. Nice quality pills.
B0013OXA5Y When I operated natural food stores and pomegranates were in season, I'd drink the juice of one every day by squeezing it all around, pricking it with my produce knife (used to butt heads of lettuce, etc.), and sucking the juice out. More recently when I learned about the antioxidant properties of pomegranates, I tried some juices that contained pomegranate juice, but I was never that impressed with the flavor nor with the amount of pomegranate said on labels to be actually in each serving. Jarrow Pomguard allows one to get the benefits of pomegranate by simply taking a daily capsule.WebMD has an informative article on the uses, side effects and interactions of pomegranate. Those considering taking a pomegranate supplement such as Jarrow PomGuard who also take prescription medications may want to check out the section on interactions at WebMD (e.g., pomegranate can lower blood pressure so someone taking any kind of medication that can also decrease blood pressure should be aware of this, plus one should know that pomegranate can \"decrease how quickly the liver breaks down some medications\").Jarrow Formulas is held in high regard in the natural food industry. Jarrow has won many awards from a number of journals and magazines geared toward natural food, nutrition and vitamin industry insiders. Based on my experience in the industry (I operated natural food co-ops and for-profit stores from the mid-70's into the early 90's) and my familiarity with Jarrow brand supplements (I've used and continue to use quite a few), I rank Jarrow highly among supplement brands in terms of quality and fair pricing.
B0013OXA5Y I take several supplements recommended by doctor and nutritionist, and although Pomguard is not one on their list, from what I have read and researched, it is good for the body in many ways.  I don't drink pomegranate juice because the sugar content is too high, so I am putting my confidence in these tablets.  .  I have tried several Jarrow products from the amazon Vine Program and they appear to be a reputable company with few additions to their products.
B0013OXA5Y This amazon page says the capsule contains gelatin, but my bottle says the capsules are vegetarian and made of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose. I don't know if they could have changed the capsule, but the image of the bottle also says vegetarian, so I'm going to assume it is.I'd love to eat a pomegranate every day. Love 'em. Or drink a bunch of pomegranate juice. Love that, too. Pretty expensive and not always in season, though. The best is when this place at the farmer's market has frozen some juice from their fall crop and has it when the market opens in the spring! But I digress...These capsules seem like a good way to get the healthy benefits of pomegranates without trying to find a pomegranate every day. I stuck my nose in the bottle and it smelled faintly of pomegranate. I opened a capsule and tasted the red powder inside. It was very bitter. Probably not surprising since this is supposed to be extracted from the whole fruit, peel, seed, everything, plus the capsules also contain silicon dioxide.The label says it contains 425mg of pomegranate extract. I wish I knew what that meant or how the different parts of the pomegranate compare in terms of antioxident levels (so is it good or bad that they use the entire fruit, even the peel?) I wish I knew how much fresh or frozen pomegranate I'd have to eat to equal the same amount. These do seem like a convenient way to get some antioxidents, and if you are intent on getting some ellagic acid, anthocyanins and ellagitannins, then it's worth a shot.
B0013OXA5Y There are a variety of ways to get the benefits of pomegranate into your diet. Of course, drinking the juice or eating them is a great way to do that (but some commercial juices have very little actual pomegranate, so read the label.) This supplement is made of pure pomegranate extract and is not synthetic. It contains a mixture of ellagic acid, anthocyanins and ellagitannins.Ellagic acid is also found in blueberries and cranberries. It's not only an antioxidant (prevents damage of cells by free radicals, which are small, highly reactive molecules) but it is believed to be \"anti-proliferative\" or an inhibitor of cancer. Lots of fruits, nuts and vegetables contain these substances (dark red fruits have anthocyanins and ellagic acid is in many nuts and berries.) So if you feel you do not get enough of these into your diet, you can supplement with this extract of pomegranate juice.
B0013OXA5Y Pomegranate is one of the recent superfoods, being extolled for its polyphenol content and the anti-oxidant and radical fighting properties thereof.What I like about Jarrow's PomGuard is that the extract is from the whole fruit (skin, seed and juice) instead of just the juice. The phytonutrients are more bioavailable when the whole fruit is consumed. Also, the pomegranate extract is 100% from California pomegranates without any synthetic ingredients.An interesting ingredient I found in this product as well as some other Jarrow capsules is silicon dioxide, aka sand. It's used to prevent powders from clumping together. At first I thought it was pretty gross to ingest sand but on further research I also found that silicon is a necessary trace element for bone development and lots of natural foods contain silicone dioxide, and it decreases the risk of dementia.Back to pomegranate capsules, PomGuard is the one I like best. I've looked at a variety of them on the internet and Jarrow's product comes with the most detailed provenance, it tells you exactly what it contains and where its from, so this is the one I would recommend most.
B0013OXA5Y Lots of people fail to eat enough fruit.  I am one of those people.  So I am always looking for ways to (easily, if possible) add fruit to my diet.  This is one great way to add some of the benefits of eating more fruit.
B0013OXA5Y For about a year, I subscribed to a monthly delivery of POMx pills, made by POM Wonderful.  Since pomegranates contain polyphenols and help neutralize free radicals, the choice to consume 1g daily was really an easy decision.  Over the course of using POMx for a year, I didn't really notice any readily apparent changes although there were probably internal and less visible benefits to my cardiovascular system and function as well as a reduction in oxidative damage.Being no stranger to Jarrow Formulas supplements, I was pleasantly surprised to see them offering PomGuard, their own pomegranate pill based on 100% California Pomegranates.  One of the obvious differences between PomGuard and POMx is the potency of the pills - PomGuard pills supply 400mg of pomegranate powder consisting of a range of polyphenolic compounds.  POMx pills provide 1000mg per capsule of their proprietary blend.  POMx is an extract of the polyphenol compounds from the whole fruit.  Likewise, PomGuard is the juice, peel, seed and membrane components of the pomegranate.  I guess as long as they both end up supplying polyphenols, the benefit is the same, though POMx seems to win the potency battle.  Do you need the equivalent of 8 oz. of pomegranate juice per day?  It ends up being your personal decision.One attraction to PomGuard is the price point which is approximately 60% less cost than POMx.  I think as a maintenance dose, PomGuard would be my choice for daily consumption.  I have noticed no ill effects from PomGuard.  Reaping the same benefits at a lower cost seems like a win-win for me.
B0013OXA5Y Pomegranate juice made from the fruit and rind has a higher level of antioxidants than juice made without the rind.  Since PomGuard includes the rind, hopefully this increases it's antioxidant levels as well.  According to Jarrow, \"PomGuard is the only supplement to combine beneficial elements from the whole fruit, including the juice, seed and peel in a single capsule.\", so if you want the benefit of all the parts of the pomegranate in a pill, this appears to be the only option.  Jarrow also says that PomGuard has \"NO synthetic ellagic acid.\"Although I prefer to eat the fruit, by taking a PomGuard pill most days, I can eat other fruits as well, without overdoing the sugar that fruits contain (I'm a low-carb person). Since I don't eat the peel when I eat the fruit, PomGuard offers an advantage here too.
B0013OXA5Y My husband is the type of person to always worry about his heart so he eats a lot of things that promote heart health, including pomegranates. But they're very expensive so instead he started taking PomGuard and he's impressed. He says they don't have a funny aftertaste and they're just like eating a pomegranate every day for your heart.
B0013OXA5Y Pomegranates are so full of vitamins and so healthy for you - but dang, they're expensive to buy and hard to eat!  Jarrow Formulas Pomguard has all the benefits of eating pomegranates all packed into one little pill.  The pill is not large, easy to swallow, and delivers quite a healthy punch of vitamins and antioxidants.  While I can't give numbers on how effective they are in my system, I can say that I eat them and feel great.  Recommended.
B0013OXA5Y As I have stated in other product reviews on items from this company, I normally always like their products. This is another one that I submit is worth looking at. I am taking this product to help introduce more antioxidants, and pomegranate extract is a good source of these. This product is in a convenient form for me to do this, because this fruit is very seasonal in my area.
B0013OXA5Y It has been proven to have cardiovascular protective effects. It is good to drink the pure pomegranate juice but that gets quite expensive. These are easy to swallow capsules that have not caused me any side effects. Like all supplements you should check with your health care provider before adding anything new. You can take 1 to 2 a day after meals. I take one as I take quite a few Jarrow supplements as I trust the quality.
B0013OXA5Y I have been buying the Pomegranate juice at my local grocery for about six months ago. It costs me around $10 a week for a small shot a day.. These have more nutrients in them than the juice, Pomegranate is a supplement that has a lot of power health benefits including hearth and blood health. I have replaced juice with these, and am saving a lot of money! I take two a day between meals. No side effects at all!
B0013OXA5Y I've always heard about pomegranates being good for you due to their red color and antioxidant properties.  However, I've never bought them and really don't like the idea of dealing with all the seeds.  This supplement gives you all the health benefits of poms in a little pill.  Perfect.  I trust Jarrow for many of my vitamins and supplements, so the brand was a go for me.  I've been taking it daily, and, whereas I know I can't tell a difference, I feel like I've got some daily insurance that I'm doing something for my health and trying to offset free radical damage.  Of course, a pill like this won't give you the fiber and moisture that you get from fruits and veggies, so I eat lots of them daily.  But I will continue taking this insurance on a daily basis.
B0013OXA5Y Jarrow Pomguard is one of the many supplements that support cardiovascular health that I have.  I will try to always take supplements for that, and many, because I've had high cholesterol.  I refuse to take statins because of muscle and other damage.  Out of the 2+ shoe boxes of supplements I take daily, many of them support bone and cardiovascular health.  Jarrow makes many of them.Jarrow is mid-priced, but quality!More from Amazon:Jarrow FORMULAS PomGuard ; derived from 100% California Pomegranates; contains a wide range of polyphenolic compounds including ellagic acid; anthocyanins and ellagitannins. Contains only pomegranate fruit extract from 100% California Pomegranates - NO synthetic ellagic acid. PomGuard : Supports cardiovascular functionReduces oxidative damage by free radicalsSupports healthy cell replication and functionKeep out of the reach of children.Patented Production Technology Yields the Ultimate Pomegranate SupplementPomGuard(tm) from Jarrow Formulas represents a new standard in antioxidant supplements. PomGuard is the only supplement to combine beneficial elements from the whole fruit, including the juice, seed and peel in a single capsule. Clinical studies have linked pomegranates to cardiovascular health and uncovered several groundbreaking discoveries about the fruit's synergistic properties. This research led to PomGuard, a product which offers the complete spectrum of beneficial pomegranate phytonutrients.*Historical Uses of the PomegranateThe use of pomegranates for healing dates back to Biblical times. Healers in many aboriginal cultures still employ the bark, leaves, peel, juice and seeds to treat many health conditions. This knowledge was brought back to Europe in the Medieval and Renaissance periods. The British Medical Association and the Royal College of Physicians of London feature the pomegranate in their coats of arms. However, this fruit has been overlooked by modern Western medicine until very recently.Antioxidant ActivityPomegranate juice is higher than tea and red wine in antioxidant activity. Indeed, in Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC) testing, a standard for antioxidant capacity, fresh pomegranate fruit and juice preparations also surpassed the antioxidant activities of cranberry, blueberry and grape juices, all of which have been touted for their free radical scavenging properties. PomGuard's mixture of juice, peel and membrane plus seed also contains approximately 20% pure pomegranate seed lignins. Lignins complement phenolic antioxidants (e.g., ellagic and gallic acids), by scavenging oxygen and nitric oxide free radicals.There is a great diversity to antioxidant action, with hundreds of different compounds acting on different types of free radicals. Nature's answer is to maintain broad-spectrum protection. Thus, in plants, phenolic antioxidants typically are associated with lignins.The superiority of antioxidant mixtures to single antioxidants is well known. In a series of studies, the antioxidant power of pure antioxidants was compared to (a) the antioxidant or cardioprotective action of complex tannins like punicalagin, (b) mixtures of punicalagin and other pomegranate tannins, and (c) whole pomegranate juice. Though punicalagin was more potent than the other single compound, the tannin mixtures were more potent than any single compound, and the whole pomegranate juice was more potent than the tannin mixture.Studies and BenefitsPomegranate juice and other fractions are known to provide numerous benefits:* Supports healthy low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) oxidation status** Enhances glutathione action, the primary antioxidant and heavy metal protector inside cells** Help maintain healthy blood platelet activity** Promotes healthy levels of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), an enzyme involved in blood pressure regulation** Supports normal cell function and replication** Induces apoptosis (programmed death)** Stimulates collagen synthesis and supports healthy cartilage life*Clinical trials with pomegranate juice at several institutions have shown significant favorable results in support of prostate, blood sugar, blood pressure, heart and arterial health and function.*
B0013OXA5Y I enjoy pomegranate juice, but it's expensive. I'm a big fan of most Jarrow products, and I'm glad they have this product because I can get a large dose of pomegranate in my diet.This is excellent if you're looking for anti-aging products. It's also good for coronary health.
B0013OXA5Y Of course I would prefer to consume the actual food rather than taking a supplement of any sort.  Real food is better when its possible, but there are certain foods that although beneficial, can be difficult to enjoy on a regular basis.I love pomegranates but only seem to have them occasionally at a salad bar or perhaps a glass of juice.  I once tried to buy and de-seed one and only succeeded in making quite a mess.  They are very good for you because they are high in antioxidants and are full of vitamin C and potassium.This supplement is easy to swallow, but it is a bit larger than an average capsule.  I have tried many products by Jarrow and have been pleased with their quality.I have been taking one per day so this bottle is a two month supply for me.  The directions indicate taking 1-2 daily.  This supplement combined with a healthy diet, exercise and my usual vitamin/mineral regime works fine for me.
B0013OXA5Y Most people know about Jarrow and how apparently good they are.  This prouct really seems to do a lot of things.Included is:Help maintain healthy blood platelet activity.  This is so important.  I have never known a vitamin or herb to do this and when my Pop was in the hospital with critically low levels of platelets this might have helped him.Supports normal cell function and replication.  In my opinion this is important to prevent cancer, because cancer is  cell replication that has gone haywire.Stimulates collagen synthesis and supports healthy cartilage life.  This is great for older joints and also athletes.It is have shown significant favorable results in support of prostate, blood sugar, blood pressure, heart and arterial health and function.  Well the jury is out but if you can take one pill a day to help in all those areas, I'm in!
B0013OXA5Y These tablets are reasonable size and go down easy. Loaded with the concentrate of the most healthy fruit on the planet. Pom is great tasting fruit but is not avaialble all year round, hence I low PomGuard as I have it available all year round for good health and prevention.
B0013OXA5Y I really love to eat pomegranates, but can't always find them in the store, or deal with the mess.  I prefer the real deal over supplements any day, but these are nice to have when eating a live pomegranate is not an option.  I know pomegranates contain a high amount of anti-oxidants and other valuable compounds, and I try to eat at least one every other day.  When I can't I take one or two of these supplements.They are easy to swallow and hopefully work almost as well as a real pomegranate.  Don't forget all the fiber you get when you eat a pomegranate so don't just take these supplements to the total exclusion of eating the real things.
B0013OXA5Y I've happily found that Jarrow supplements tend to both work well and be well tolerated by my body.  I do feel a mild boost in immunity when taking pomegranate.  (Although, I'd rather just skip these pills and eat the yummy fruit or drink the yummy juice.)These are NOT marketed or intended as contraceptives (and I am in no way qualified to recommend them as such!), however it is said that in ancient times pomegranate seeds were used as contraceptives and abortofacients.  Two very good reasons to avoid these during pregnancy.  If you are pregnant, please take extra care in speaking with your doctor about any supplements you are considering.As always when reviewing a supplement, I wish to state that I am not a medical professional and remind you to seek input (and approval) from your medical provider before taking this or any supplement.
B0013OXA5Y For years I've been reading about all the benefits of pomegranates, and I love the taste of both raw pomegranate and pom juice.However, I don't eat/drink pomegranate because of a low glycemic diet...and not to mention the expense. The supplements are a great way to get all the benefits without having to eat the actual fruit.As you may know, the more antioxidants in your diet the better. Antioxidants help ward off free radicals, which cause many diseases including most cancers, cause skin problems & premature aging, etc etc. And, pomegranates are about the most potent form of antioxidants on the planet.And I just learned recently that pomegranates also enhance glutathione action, which is how your body flushes a wide variety of toxins including heavy metals from your system (mercury from fish, lead from the environment, etc).So I love these supplements, and the price is about average, nothing bad to say about them at all. However, for things like this I prefer to buy powder (sold by the ounce, or by the kilo) and add it directly to shakes, smoothies, other drinks like lemonade, or even baking.We often drink protein shakes in the morning, and it's easy just to pre-mix the raw pomegranate powder along with the shake mix, so I don't have to remember to add it. The cost of powder vs. capsules is much cheaper, and it's one less pill I have to remember to take. You can actually do this for just about anything, including 1-a-day vitamins. I'm still experimenting with different brands (obviously one bag lasts a *looong* time) so I don't have a recommendation.I haven't decided yet which company is best quality and price, but if you're interested in this method it's easy to find powder suppliers on google, the auction sites, direct from manufacturers, and even on Amazon. I can say that Navitas sells supplements in powder form on Amazon, and it's convenient and good quality, but they are also the most expensive powder I've seen (at about $2.25 per ounce). Though that's still cheaper than capsule form (this whole bottle of Jarrow 60 capsules is 25.5 grams, which works out to about $14 per ounce!).Food for thought - hope this helps!
B0013OXA5Y While this won't get rid of an active prostate infection, it works very well at keeping my husband's prostate issues at bay after the infection is gone.
B0013OXA5Y I love pomegranates and eat them almost everyday when they are in season (I see them in stores only October through January). They are expensive but delicious and very healthy. Now I can have a benefits of this superfruit for the whole year and way cheaper. Of only the pill would taste the same;)
B0013OXA5Y Supports Cardiovascular Function- I have always been a fan of Jarrow and this product hasn't changed my mind. Jarrow Formulas Pomguard 425mg, 60 Tablets does everything that they claim to do for me. I have used this particular product for about three months. I have blood work regularly done for my high cholesterol, among other problems. I haven't noticed any magical changes, but have noticed a slight dip in my try's and cholesterol. This is great, because my Try's and Cholesterol has continued to increase over the past twenty years and I have used every pharmaceutical medication offered since 1990, as well as watching my diet. To no avail, nothing has helped lower these or prevent the increase until using Pomguard 425 mg pills. I do have heart disease and while continuing my use of mentioned meds, I use Jarrow as a supplement because I'm allergic to niacin, the most common supplement.Provides Antioxidant Protection- I am aware that pomegranates has long been known as an method of antioxidants. I have researched the use of pomegranates and good health for a while. My 94 year old grandmother had pomegranates trees long before the research proved it is an antioxidant. The older southern people relied on home remedies to help with good health and better living.  What I am saying is I truly believe in natural supplements, much like my southern ancestors, that had a long, good life even before they knew of cancer. I highly suggest that anyone of any age use such products.
B0013OXA5Y Potential health benefits per WiKi:In preliminary laboratory research and clinical trials, juice of the pomegranate may be effective in reducing heart disease risk factors, including LDL oxidation, macrophage oxidative status, and foam cell formation. In mice, \"oxidation of LDL by peritoneal macrophages was reduced by up to 90% after pomegranate juice consumption...\".In a limited study of hypertensive patients, consumption of pomegranate juice for two weeks was shown to reduce systolic blood pressure by inhibiting serum angiotensin-converting enzyme. Juice consumption may also inhibit viral infections[54] while pomegranate extracts have antibacterial effects against dental plaque.Despite limited research data, manufacturers and marketers of pomegranate juice have liberally used evolving research results for product promotion, especially for putative antioxidant health benefits. In February 2010, the FDA issued a Warning Letter to one such manufacturer, POM Wonderful, for using published literature to make illegal claims of unproven antioxidant and anti-disease benefits.
B0013OXA5Y The use of Pomegranate is said to have very rich antioxidant properties, the development if. Supplement makes it easier to benefit from this fruit. The juice itself takes time to acquire a taste, which I still have not, so the pill form is a great idea!
B0013OXA5Y I've been taking these for a while and feel better, more energized!! I have not had any negative side effects. Reading up on the ingredients, this is a good formula. I'm starting to really like Jarrow.
B0013OXA5Y Wow, I didn't know that Pomegranate juice is higher than tea and red wine in antioxidant activity!I was taking those ( tea and red wine extract)in supplement form, along with drinking green tea (without milk or sweeteners for its antioxidant properties, definitely not \"yummy\", but best utilized when taken that way.However I have switched to this Pomguard. it is one of those things that I have not \"felt\" any difference but due to the family history of heart trouble & high blood pressure it is just smart to be proactive in this area! Not to mention it is cheaper than what I was spending on less effective antioxidants, so for me it is a great value!
B0013OXA5Y I have been diagnosed with high blood pressure but am currently not on any medication.  Fortunately, since stopping the medication, my blood pressure has been stable.  However, I don't want to take chances.  Jarrow's Pomguard is an anti-oxidant to help with your cardiovascular system and blook pressure.  So far I'm very impressed with it.  I took my blood pressure every day and it never went up while taking this supplement.  I highly recommend this product.
B0013OXA5Y I love pomegranates, but they're not the easiest fruit to consume. Full pomegranates are messy and alternative sources are often quite expensive. That's where these tablets come in.These pills are easy to take and supply you with the antioxidants that you'd get from a regular pomegranate. The pills themselves have a slight odor, but this doesn't really make them harder to take. I've taken them with food and on an empty stomach and there have not been any issuesIf you're looking for more antioxidants in your diet, you should give these tablets a try. They're easy to take and get you all the benefits of the fruit without any of the hassle.
B0013OXA5Y It's best to get your nutrients from whole foods, rather than supplements.  This isn't always practical however.  Pomegranates can be expensive and they're not always in the stores, plus they can be messy to eat.PomGuard contains a wide variety of polyphenolic compounds, including ellagic acid, anthocyanins and ellagiannins.  I had to look these up, since I wasn't exactly sure what these were.  I knew they were good for me, but that was about it.  These are powerful antioxidants that can help reduce inflammation.Why I like this product:* The pills are gel caps, small and easy to swallow.* The pills don't have an unpleasant smell, like several other supplements.* It's an easy way to get antioxidant protection.  Plus, each pill has a concentrated amount of the polyphenolic compounds.* The pills are easy on my stomach.  I suffer from gastritis and acidic fruits like pomegranate can make me feel very nauseous.  I can take the pills with no side effects.As with any supplement, you should check with your doctor before taking these.  These can interfere with statins or blood pressure medication.I do recommend these as a great way to add more antioxidants to your diet.  Of course, eating the whole foods is better, but this can be a nice supplement to that.
B0013OXA5Y I liked the tart taste of this fruit, but they were messy and slow to eat, and so these days, I'm quite content taking these easy-to-take tablets.  They offer all the health benefits of pomegranates without the nuisance of eating.  Highly recommended.
B0013OXA5Y Most sources tell you pomegranates are a big deal super food.  They and pomegranate juice are expensive, however, and the juice may have added sugars to make it tastier so that's added calories.  This Jarrow pomegranate extract is probably the way to go to pay out less money and consume less calories.Depending on what source you read, you can find that pomegranates do everything from help you lose weight to prevent cancer.  There's not yet hard evidence to substantiate most assertions.  However, since pomegranates are rich in polyphenols and have antioxidant value, anyone gung-ho antioxidants will be happy to take this supplement.  There's little evidence you can be harmed and a good chance it may help y
B0013OXA5Y If you're like me, you know you need to get more antioxidants in your daily diet - antioxidants are said to fight against cancer (by eliminating free radicals) and improve cell and heart functions: Jarrow POMGUARD provides 60 VEGETARIAN capsules as a dietary supplement, and includes 100% California Pomegranates.  And I absolutely ADORE pomegrantes, but they available for such a short period every year, so in the meantime (and if you don't eat up a bunch of blueberries instead), this is a great way to get your pomegranate OUT of Season :)...I would definitely recommend!
B0013OXA5Y I wanted to give it a month before writing the review, I starting taking 2 pills a day after my meal, within a month my BP went from 155 to 132, and I feel much better. So we are clear, I was on BP meds and I basically tried them all I was having bad side effects. I decided to give this a try. I think is a miracle. Granted my BP sometimes spikes a little to 140, but it has been between 127 and 132 for the past week. I will keep using this and order some more.
B0013OXA5Y If I had to name my favorite fruit, pomegranate would make it on the top of the list.  Some members of my family are mesmerized when I spend long time cleaning the big pomegranate fruit.  Others took more practical approach.  They bought me a special tool that cleans the fruit quickly  - but I still find it pleasant to clean it manually; it is almost a form of meditation.When I saw that Jarrow company offers product called PomGuard, I had to check it out.  This dietary supplement is made of 100% California pomegranate extract. Supplement comes in a capsule and it is easy to swallow with a little bit of water.  Directions indicate that one can take 1-2 capsules a day (morning and/or evening).  Pomegranate fruit contains powerful antioxidants.  This particular supplement helps promote cardiovascular function, it reduces oxidative damage from free radicals and supports healthy cell replication.I guess if there was any other way to make this supplement, I would like it to come in a chewable form.  One of the beauty of pomegranate fruit is its juicinesss, which is obviously missing when supplement comes in a form of a capsule.  However, I am still happy my body gets to enjoy the advantages of this heavenly fruit.
B0013OXA5Y I am biased because I like pomegrenate, the fruit itself, and thus I believe in its magic.  That said, I wish I were eating a pomegrenate instead of a tablet but until then, I'll pop this pill every day.
B0013OXA5Y Pomegranates - nature's wonder fruit. Used in traditional remedies for thousands of years, you'll find mention of Pomegranates in many ancient texts and religious writings. Pomegranates are way too expensive for my taste - or daily consumption. Same for the juice, plus there's all the sugars and calories in juice.  If you're looking for the benefits without the expense, calories and mess, this is an ideal option!  Plus since they are formulated using 100% American grown Pomegranates, you can be sure of the quality of the fruit.
B0013OXA5Y I really like supplements, which are derived from a food source, that give me extra nutrition.  As it isn't possible to eat in a single day all the things that keep one healthy, these supplements take the goodness of pomegranates and provide us with two important preventative benefits: antioxidants and heart health.  I felt great taking this product and I am sure it improved my health as well.
B0013OXA5Y I got this product because of all the benefits of antioxidants. Products like Pom Juice is very expensive so I figured I could get all of the benefits in a capsule form. I can't really tell a difference physically, but I'm confident that in the long run I will see the benefits. I finished one bottle and ordered a second. You can't beat the price when compared to the juices available.
B0013OXA5Y Jarrow Formulas Pomguard is a wonderful Antioxidant solution. PomGuard is a multifunctional supplement helping to support cardiovascular function (blood flow/heart health) as well as a strong antioxidant. Each capsule contains 425mg of Pomegranate Extract. You simply take one capsule a day and you're on your way to better health. It's definitely worth a try if you're looking a fruit supplement.
B0013OXA5Y Everyone, especially those who work out hard or have physically strenuous jobs, needs lots of anti-oxidants to keep their bodies healthy and strong. Pomegranate is one of the best whole food sources of a wide range of anti-oxidants, but the fruit is expensive, kind of a pain to eat, and not always to everyone's liking. Jarrow has concentrated all the benefits of pomegranate into this easy to swallow, and relatively (when compared to the actual fruit) inexpensive product. Having looked at other pomegranate anti-oxidant products, I believe this to be one of the best buys out of all of them considering strength, quality, and price.
B0013OXA5Y I'm not a big fan of taking extracts instead of consuming the actual food that they are derived from. In general, I'd rather eat an actual pomegranate than drink the juice or take a capsule. However, it is not practical to consume the fruit everyday. In fact, there are many foods with antioxidant qualities that are difficult to eat daily. In the case of pomegranates, there are two issues that make them a little harder to eat regularly. One is they are expensive. Another is that the fruit is a little troublesome to extract the edible arils from. In the past, I have purchased them and removed the arils only to find that sometimes they get moldy before I can eat them all and I've also found that I can have a strange digestive response to the seeds on occasion. This extract allows one to have the benefits without the potential problems.If you consider the average cost of a pomegranate, the cost of a 30-60-day (depending on if you take one or two capsules per day) is pretty reasonable as long as this is your main antioxidant supplement. Taking them is a pretty average experience for a supplement. However, these are in the middle of the pack price-wise and not the cheapest option. The capsules are neither too big nor small and are easy to swallow (though they are not specially coated, just normal clear capsules full of deep red powder). They do smell a bit chemical though. Frankly, they smell like glue, though you don't really taste anything or burp up anything odd after taking one (with food).The only down side is that pomegranates are delicious and that there is a loss of the seed nutrients (fiber, oils, micronutrients) if you choose an extract over the real deal.
B0013OXA5Y Admittedly, my family's diet doesn't have enough fruit in it. Due to the high cost of fresh fruit here and the fact that it goes bad nearly right after you bring it home we don't eat enough of it. I've been experimenting with vitamin therapy and these seem to help increase energy.For those that have a hard time taking pills, as I do, these are a normal sized capsule and they are easy to take.Overall, I'd recommend.
B0013OXA5Y Every so often, we are told of a new 'Superfood'.John Kellogg thought corn flakes were a superfood in the 1800s.Red is the new health color, pushing green aside...for the moment. I already take Jarrow anti-oxidant and Resveratrol formulas, so perhaps this is overkill. Still, can't hurt, might help!
B0013OXA5Y I've taken a lot of pomegranate pills over the years they help to keep me healthy. These work as well as any others I have taken and are easy to swallow.
B0013OXA5Y I drink POM and if you drink POM you know how expensive it is. This bottle is definitely worth the price to get the effects of pomegranate (in my opinion) I'd also rather take these than drink POM myself, as I'm not a fan of the taste. I like the brand Jarrow, is it my favorite? No, but this seemed to work fine for me.
B0013OXA5Y I ignored the whole pomegranate craze until recently.  On the East coast, I rarely ever see fresh pomegranates at my local grocery store.  The one time I did purchase one, it rotted before I could figure out how to open it and eat it.Over the last few months, my blood pressure has been creeping upward.  Whether that is due to gaining a few pounds or perhaps stress, I cannot say.  It is probably a combination of the two.  A friend had recently told me that pomegranates are supposed to be beneficial to blood pressure.  When I had the opportunity to try these Jarrows Formulas Pomguard tablets through the Amazon Vine program, I figured that I did not have anything to lose.I have been taking these for a month now.  At the beginning of the month, my blood pressure was averaging 150/90.  My readings for the last few days have been averaging 140/80.  I have not changed my diet or my non-existent exercise routine.  I have not lost weight.  The main source of my stress is still present (and snoring loudly) as well.  :)I can only guess that these Pomguard tablets are helping my blood pressure.  Of course, you should always listen to the advice of your physician regarding medical treatment and medications.  I intend to keep taking these for the long term.
B0013OXA5Y Jarrow is the perfect choice for supplements, because they provide superior quality products at an excellent price that don't disappoint. This potent Pomguard formula is not an exception. It delivers a high dose of antioxidants that work magic on the body. I personally love this product. Highly recommended for its potential health quality and reasonable price.
B0013OXA5Y Pomguard is a good supplement for increasing cardiovascular health and for slowing aging because of its antioxidant properties. It puts the healing power of pomegranates in concentrate. It is easier to use than eating promogranates themselves which have a lot of seeds. Drinking the juice is okay, but this supplement is better if you are looking to avoid fructose sugar intake. According to Dr. Mercola, fructose sugar is unhealthy beyond 25 grams a day.
B0013OXA5Y Pomegranates have recently been hailed as a super-food good for the heart/cardiovascular system as well as an excellent antioxidant. Pomegranate juice has suddenly become a big item in health food stores and groceries all across the country as a result. It seems the fruit itself isn't something people like to deal with, despite it actually being much easier to prepare for eating than the tons of seeds lead one to expect. It is also a seasonal fruit, and not a cheap fruit. The solution we've been provided is a capsule containing what are believed to be the most beneficial ingredients of the fruit, in particular ellagic acid, anthocyanins and ellagitannins. Most of the supplements currently available on the store shelves contain synthetic forms of these ingredients that are almost certainly inferior to the natural, straight-from-the-pomegranate forms. Even drinks advertised as pomegranate juice usually contain only a small amount of the real stuff, so read the labels before buying!It will be years before we know if pomegranates actually provide the benefits we now expect, but it has been a popular medicinal fruit for thousands of years in several cultures. This Jarrow product is the best of the pomegranate-derived supplements I've encountered to date, so I'm going to keep buying buying and taking it.
B0013OXA5Y I'm becoming a fan of the Jarrow Forumulas product line. So far I've been taking these for about two and a half weeks and zero issue. I'm a big fan of pomegranate juice in general so I get my fill of antioxidants both fresh and preserved. These Pomguard tablets are easy to swallow and so far, no side effects. I don't feel any extra burst of energy or anything hyperbolic like that, but nor have I had anything like upset stomachs or things of the sort.  So far, so good.
B0013OXA5Y What are pomegranates good for? Researchers report that they are rich in antioxidants that can keep bad LDL cholesterol from oxidizing. This degradation of LDL seems to be an initial step in the development of atherosclerosis. In addition, pomegranate extract, like aspirin, can help keep blood platelets from clumping together to form unwanted clots.Research has found that pomegranate extract improved the amount of oxygen getting to the heart muscle of patients with coronary heart disease. Other researchers report that long-term consumption of pomegranate extract may help combat E.D. Investigators are also excited about the possibility that pomegranate compounds might prevent prostate cancer or slow its growth. In mice, treatment with pomegranate extract delayed the development of tumors and improved survival Other research reports suggest that pomegranate juice might help reduce the risk of breast cancer. Arthritis may be hlped by this extract due to the reduction in inflammation that results.A little fun fact:The fruit features in Greek mythology in the story of Persephone, daughter of the harvest goddess Demeter. Hades, the lord of the underworld, kidnapped the beautiful maiden. Because she ate a few pomegranate seeds before being rescued, she had to spend several months every year in the underworld with him. According to the myth, that's when the earth was forced to endure winter. Persephone might have done better to resist eating pomegranate seeds, but science suggests that most of us could benefit!
B0013OXA5Y If you're reading this review, you probably already know that pomegranates are a potent source of many types of nutrients. It's hard to get and use fresh pomegranates, so if you're looking for a pomegranate supplement I can recommend this one. I can't address the results of taking it over time, but I do feel like it infuses my system with a wonderful antioxidant support and I trust Jarrow as a company. You get a high concentration of all the active portions of the pomegranate fruit.
B0013OXA5Y This is a great way to add pomengranates and their anti-oxidents to your diet. My stomach has felt better and I feel bet
B0013OXA5Y My husband and I take certain supplements every day for different needs.  We both have low blood pressure so we need to be careful with those supplements that can lower it even more.  Antioxidants are a good way to keep healthy but they can cause a decrease in blood pressure if taken in large doses.  The suggested dose is to take a capsule one or two times a day after a meal.  Each capsule contains 425mg of pomegranate extract.One capsule a day is enough for my husband and I take one capsule every other day.  This is the only way we can keep our blood pressure stable and yet get the benefit of the supplement.  This might mean that people with high blood pressure could benefit from the pomegranate extract.As with any other supplement, my recommendation is to do research before any purchase especially if considering taking this supplement in combination with others.
B0013OXA5Y I can't say with certainty but it seems like there is enough evidence out there that this supplement is beneficial to cardiac health.  Jarrow Formulas is a good brand that is well trusted.  The pills are easy to swallow for me and I have had no negative effects.  I am not sure if there are positive effects or not, but research encourages me to continue taking the product.
B0013OXA5Y Pomegranates are a well known source of antioxidants, however, many of us are not able to have an affordable supply of them throughout the year. PomGuard is a great substitute for those times when you can't get fresh pomegranates. In fact, it might even be better, because the whole fruit, including the juice, seed and peel is used, instead of just part of it.PomGuard is primarily taken for circulatory health, regulation of cholesterol, healthy blood platelets, normal cell function, and stimulating and supporting healthy cartilage life. As with most vitamins and supplements, it is best taken with a meal to avoid any stomach upset. I have not had any problems with off-taste, stomach upset or repeating while consuming these.PomGuard comes in easy to swallow Vegetarian (gelatin) capsules and are made from 100% California Pomegranates. I cannot find any information stating that these are organic or non-GMO.
B0013OXA5Y I chose to rate Jarrow Formulas Pomguard 5 stars because it is a great supplement. The company Jarrow seems to have placed a lot of research into this product, I love the formulationI also appreciate them not adding any additional \"fillers\" to the product, just 100% Pomegranate Extract. It is Wheat/Gluten/soy/dairy free and vegetarian/vegan friendly.I rotate this supplement with a few others to spread their benefits longer. For instance one day I'll take this supplement and another day i may take MK-7, another day I'll take Methyl B-12, etc.Overall, a great supplement for cardiovascular function, fights free radicals and supports heathly cells!
B0013OXA5Y Jarrow talks about the many possible health benefits of their PomGuard product. Among them are: healthy platelet activity, healthy levels of ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme), prostate, antioxidant, blood sugar, blood pressure, heart and arterial benefits, and more.Whether or not those can be substantiated is really a question that I cannot answer in this review.What I can tell you is that Jarrow's product provides the benefits of the entire pomegranate fruit - juice, seed, and peel. PomGuard's mixture of juice, peel and membrane and seed contains approximately 20% pure pomegranate seed lignins. The PomGuard capsule provides fruit extract from 100% California pomegranates, with nothing synthetic or artificial.I can also say that I've felt great since taking these daily. I simply cannot tell you - without a complete medical exam - whether they have actually contributed to all of the benefits ascribed to the product.
B0013OXA5Y I long ago discovered the wonderful taste of pomegranate during a visit to Israel.  It's one of their revered \"seven species\" of fruits/vegetables (along with olives, dates, etc).  In the process, I learned of the super health benefits of the fruit, especially its antioxidant properties.  Here in the Midwest, one cannot always readily buy a fresh pomegranate.  There are processed juices available, but those are often diluted and/or modified.  Now, this Jarrow Formulas Pomguard allows me easy access to the benefits of pomegranate daily, and at a reduced cost to buying the fresh fruit (granted, I'm missing the great taste experience).This supplement comes in the form of a typical clear capsule containing a brownish powder.  Recommended dose is one capsule one or two times daily after meals, with a capsule providing 425 mg of pomegranate extract from California pomegranates (and nothing else).  60 vegetarian friendly capsules per bottle. Contains no wheat, gluten, soybeans, dairy, eggs, fish, shellfish, peanuts, or nuts.  And Jarrow is a highly reputable manufacturer - I take several of their supplements.The label has a boilerplate \"consult your physician\" warning for people with medical conditions or taking medications.  ok.I have experienced no ill or other side effects after taking these.
B0013OXA5Y This is a great and easy supplement.  Once again Jarrow makes a quality product.  The research behind pomegranate is a little fuzzy and people use it for all types of conditions from breathing better to flu treatment to improved blood flow.  I find that it has a moderate breathing enhancement, but it is hard to say if that is weather related or not.  Either way, if you are looking for a pom supplement that is quick and easy, this one is for you.  Personal trial and opinion about what pom does for you is the best course of action.  I use it, I like it.  It helps me, maybe it will help you too.
B0013OXA5Y Good for keeping the blood pressure down. My bp has been creeping up in recent years but I believe that this, plus a couple of other supplements has helped bring it down. I absolutely love Jarrow Formulas, not only are they affordable, but also a very reliable brand.
B0013OXA5Y I've been taking these supplements daily for the last 3 weeks and while I can't report any miracles yet, I at least have no complaints either. I've used many supplements from Jarrow before and have trusted them to create high quality products. Pomguard is just as good as the others, in my opinion. The capsules are easy to swallow and digest without complaint.I decided to try taking pomegranate because of how soothed my stomach always felt after eating them. Unfortunately they're very expensive and not always in season, so I wondered if I'd feel the same with Pomguard. The effect is not quite the same, but I do believe I have better digestion after taking a capsule or two. I don't even know if Pomegranate is supposed to help digestion, I know they're allegedly good for many things, but that's how I've been using them. I also feel like I have a healthier urine flow, similar to the effects of cranberry juice. Perhaps my imagination, but so far everything is going well. I'm looking forward to continuing my routine to see if notice any other positive health benefits from taking pomegranate. If I discover anything really exciting, I'll be sure to update my review.
B0013OXA5Y I took this for a month and didn't see or feel any reactions, good or bad.  I don't think it would hurt a person to take this, so I feel it's a good supplement anyway.
B0013OXA5Y If you've never tried it, POM with milk, about 50/50 mix is heavenly.  It's like a milkshake.  But POM is expensive, and buying one bottle a week costs a lot.  Switching to tabs was great, saved me some money and I can still have my POM milkshake when I want.  Eating pomegranates raw is messy.  Takes a lot of time to suck on each seed and then spit them out.
B0013OXA5Y I have to admit, I'd never heard of Jarrow until recently when I started taking these and some vitamin B12. I'd always just gotten whatever was cheapest at Costco. In both cases I've been extremely impressed with the quality. The pills are easy to swallow the nutritional value high. A lot of times I don't care about it, but it was nice to see that it was made from California pomegranates; when it's something that is crushed up you never know what pesticides might be mixed in and at least coming from California you know it shouldn't be anything to heinous.I can't say I feel any different from these pills, but then again I wouldn't really expect to. They're mostly a preventative measure.  One of the purposes of antioxidants is to prevent the growth of cancer cells.  Antioxidants neutralize free radicals by providing the extra electron needed to make a pair or by simply breaking down the free radical molecule. In short, a healthy amount of antioxidants may help prevent you from getting cancer or other diseases or at least decrease your odds.  However, you don't have to much of a good thing or it could become dangerous. It should not take several these pills a day to try to become super healthy or something; you'll probably end up doing more harm than good.One thing you should be very careful about, is interaction with medicines. I have seen a couple of mentions that said that pomegranate may interfere with certain drugs you're taking the same way grapefruit can. If you're taking any kind of prescription medication, I would highly recommend that you actually ask your doctor before taking a supplement like this. Most likely he/she will say it's just fine, but it's better safe than sorry.The pills have no real taste and weren't bad to swallow, though even if you're like me and swallow most pills without water, you'll need some water with these.  Overall, I have no real complaints.  Nice product.
B0013OXA5Y Taking Jarrow Formulas Pomguard is a wonderful way to get the antioxidant power of pomegranates in a cost effective pill. Pomguard supports cardiovascular function, reduces oxidative damage by free radicals, and supports healthy cell replication and function.Like others who have posted reviews, I have been spending lots of money on pomegranate juice and love being able to get the same benefits for less money.Jarrow's products are top shelf products and I trust them completely.
B0013OXA5Y Pomegranate is reported as a pretty safe supplement to take. It is used for the flu, tapeworms, reversing atherosclerosis and for a few other conditions. I finished the bottle with no ill effects. People with food allergies may want to exercise caution if they have never been exposed to pomegranates. After researching this product I decided that although I feel it is a useful supplement, it is not going to be one that I keep in my routine.
B0013OXA8G I've been taking Jarrow formulas for years, this is a good product.  Phosphatydlserine is a fairly expensive supplement, and this one is one of the lowest priced one's I've found, in a good brand.
B0013OXA8G After finding out I was low on serine and told to purchase this type, I have better cognitive and other brain functions.  Sometimes I do not remember to take it and I notice the difference...like now!
B0013OXA8G Serine is a bit harder to find in the diet.Definitely noticed calmer and more relaxed.  Not a great long term solution but feels good to take it.
B0013OXA8G Years ago, one of my physicians recommended I use this supplement.  I take it at night.  If you research the info on Phosphatidylserine, you'll find that it works at the cellular level and it especially good for brain function.
B0013OXA8G I don't think I needed to use these, Im still young and felt like these were just b.s pills! I returned them! People swear they work from the testimonials I read online but its just not for me...
B0013OXA8G I've only heard good things about jarrow vitamins,  and this product hasnt changed my mind.Gave it to my mom,  but didnt see  any real differences from  when she was taking the &#34;now&#34; kind...I'm giving it 4 stars because I know jarrow is a good company.  Whether the stuff works,  I dunno,  as I didnt try it for me
B0013OXA8G Three months ago, I started taking these (1-3 daily) in addition toNature's Way Alive Once Daily Women's Multi Ultra Potency, Tablets, 60-Count, fish oil and extra vitamin D. I'm ~3/4 through my first (and very challenging) year of medical school now, and I've managed to stay healthy while everyone around me is getting run-down and sick. The PS-100, this Jarrow product SPECIFICALLY (I've tried a few) is noticeably effective at helping sustain my academic endurance.
B0013OXA8G I used to take gel caps but when this arrived I was surprised to see they were capsules. I didn't read carefully. However, I also found out that this product has little or no taste so I put it in my smoothie in the morning and I can't taste it. Now I don't have to swallow all those gel caps.
B0013OXA8G I know a lot of people use this supplement daily, and that's fine - if you can afford it. I cannot afford to take 2 or 3 capsules a day everyday, so I will just take a short 5 day regimen of PS to optimize how long a bottle lasts.When I take PS, I notice that I wake in the morning and feel more refreshed. As a result, my head feels clearer and thoughts come more naturally. I'll always keep a bottle of this on the shelf, and take some when I feel like I need to have a good day the next morning.
B0013OXABS &#2951; Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary:&#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150; Highly recommended with warm fuzzies!I first heard about Coenzyme Q10 in 2007 after reading Dr. Andrew Weil's book \"Healthy Aging\" and it really piqued my curiosity since CoQ10 has the unique ability to increase oxygen utilization in our cells.  Many people still have not heard about Coenzyme Q10 since it is far less publicized than the usual vitamins and minerals.  But in 1978, Peter Mitchell was awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry and part of the reason for the award was his discovery of how CoQ10 helps the mitochondria in our cells turn oxygen into energy.These soft-gel capsules are quite large in size, but I found them easy to swallow when washed down with a big gulp of water.  I have not felt any side effects from taking this supplement.  This is a very valuable supplement to take, especially as you age into your 40s, 50s, and beyond.  I highly recommend this supplement!
B0013OXABS You would honestly think that you were ingesting 1 gram of Ubiquinol when you see the gel cap!These are 3 times larger than the last 100mg Ubiquinol that I purchased. My wife refuses to take them.
B0013OXABS I'm a big fan of this product as it says that absorbs more quickly, and seems to imply more bioavailability.  I've been taking it it for a month and am very satisfied but admit I'm not sure how to evaluate the claims vs reality, but have no compliance data. I'm astifd
B0013OXABS Ubiquinol is an antioxidant found in almost every living cell and is essential for mitochondrial synthesis of energy.  It is manufactured by the human body but not in significant amounts so external supplementation is needed, especially as the body ages.  It effects cardiovascular health, neuronal metabolism, renal health, and genes related to lipid and lipoprotein metabolism and inflammation.  As for energy production, it aides in the production of ATP via signaling pathways and the genes relating to cholesterol, lipid and lipoprotein metabolism, which is anti-aging and improves cardiovascular health.  Studies have also shown that ubiquinol improved sperm density, motility, and morphology.  It was also shown to inhibit the release of proinflammatory substances, another cardiovascular disease potentiator. One problem is that CoEnzyme Q10 is not well absorbed by the body but in a comparison, ubiquinol exhibited significantly better bioavailablity than ubiquinone.  I take 400mg per day in divided doses and never miss a day!  I can not say if this formulation is better than any of the others I have tried but this company  has an excellent reputation.
B0013OXABS Jarrow Formulas Ubiquinol QH-Absorb appears to be a form of highly absorbable and effective Co-Enzyme Q-10, which is what, in powdered form, I have been giving (for years) to my Cee Cee cat who has a very definite heart murmur. At 13, she still scurries around, jumps and plays -- so Co-Q10 may be contributing to HER health.However, she's NOT getting MY Jarrow Formulas Ubiquinol QH-Absorb, which although a large softgel, IS a softgel easy to swallow, which means it is highly absorbable in the body where it counts -- the stomach, and possibly the gut.Jarrow Formulas Ubiquinol QH-Absorb has been tested and researched on a control group of people whose results after the study, proved to be positive. I couldn't agree more with this conclusion -- as Co-Q10, formerly a highly underrated/unknown supplement, seems to be exactly what the world needs today for heart health.in addition, \"After about age 45, total Q levels and QH levels tend to decline in various critical tissues.\" And after age 45, we have more than enough stressors to our lives and health to worry about -- it appears the Jarrow Formulas Ubiquinal Qh-Absorb is just what is needed for quick absorption in \"older\" bodies.I have a mild heart murmur -- heart trouble ran in my family. So perhaps Jarrow Formulas Ubiquinol QH-Absorb is just the ticket for my ticker. I continue to take it every day. The price is reasonable, given the healthful effects it appears to produce in the body.Thank you Jarrow, for your research, studies, and the efficacy and purity of your products.
B0013OXABS I have taken Co-Enzyme Q10 for many years, it is an important enzyme for cellular health. Our bodies don't make as much of it as we age. It is important for heart health and oral health as well. A good toothpaste and oral rinse will include Co-Q10 (like PerioBrite, TheraBreath, PerioTherapy and others, you can find all of these on Amazon) as well. Ubiquinol is the advanced form of Co-Q10, which doesn't require the body to break it down so it is more easily absorbed. Qbiquinol is generally more expensive than Co-Q10 (which can be expensive for the higher potency formulas). This is an excellent formula of Ubiquinol. It has a fast absorption and enhanced stability so that you get the full benefit must faster. It is gluten free but does have soy. Jarrow is a high quality vitamin manufacturer that makes excellent products. They focus on creating the proper formulas for their vitamin supplements to enhance absorption and usability. I have used their products before. Ubiquinol is beneficial for us as we hit our 30s and beyond. If you have diabetes, high blood pressure or other conditions, this product can be very beneficial for you. Many good doctors will recommend Co-Q10 and Qbiquinol to their patients. If you have never tried Co-Q10 or Qbiquinol before, you may wish to start with a lower dose of Co-Q10 first and work your way up. If you have conditions as mentioned before, higher formulas will be beneficial. This is an important product to add to your health regimen, just as important as fish oil, Vitamin C or calcium. I highly recommend this product. It has helped to give me more energy and is excellent for heart health. Be sure to take this with a meal and not on an empty stomach. It is even more effective with exercise and a good diet. While we can't always eat right, I do make sure I take my vitamin supplements and hit the gym for exercise.
B0013OXABS Having tried out many of their supplements over the years, and having taken one on a daily basis for years, I have come to trust Jarrow Formulas.  I have taken cholesterol medication for many years, and my doctor has adamantly recommended that I take 100mg of CoQ10 each day with my cholesterol pill so I don't lose energy and become sluggish.  I have purchased a wide variety of CoQ10 supplements over the years, different brands and strengths, usually looking for the best value.Jarrow Forumlas Ubiquinol QH-Absorb provides the benefits of 100mg of CoQ10, suggesting that this formula works better and is absorbed faster by your body.  Both online and in very small print on the bottle, Jarrow provides all kinds of information on how and why this Ubiquinol formula works, and I am not someone who is inclined to study this at length.  If there is something I need to take, recommended by my doctor, I look for the best and most affordable version I can find.  This formula is not the most affordable, but I have to say that, after a couple of weeks, it seems to work just as well as my generic store-brand CoQ10 capsules.  I won't likely know until my next round of blood work if there is any change to my cholesterol, but if - like me - you are pretty much required to take CoQ10 every day, you may want to give this a try to see if it helps.
B0013OXABS I'd like to write a good review for these vitamins, but the truth is I noticed an increase in headaches once I started taking them. Once I stopped, no more headaches!Something doesn't work for me in these vitamins, but your mileage may vary.
B0013OXABS Ubiquinal is a reduced form of Co-Q10. What that means in simple terms is that it is the reduced active antioxidant state of Co-Q10. This is the type made by cells in the body and is much better absorbed than regular Co-Q10, especially as people age.As it says on the bottle, \"Jarrow Formulas QH-absorb is a proprietary enhanced stability formula, which has been clinically shown in humans to increase Co-Q10 levels up to 777% (6.14X) over baseline at 300 mg per day intake.\"This sounds good to me. These are very big black pills. Serving size, as stated on the bottle, is one per day.Each softgel contains 100mg of Ubiquinol (Kaneka QH). Kaneka QH is a registered trademark of the Kaneka Corporation of Japan.The bottle states that these are gluten free. Other ingredients as stated are: Medium chain trigycerides, phosphatidylcholine (from soy lecithin), beeswax, rosmarinic acid, vitamin E, and ascorbyl palm itate. Softget consists of gelatin, glycerin and water. Carob extract and caramel added. Contains: Soy.Ubiquinol is a fat soluable substance, meaning it must have fat to be absorbed. I take these with my fattiest meal of the day, to hopefully have as much absorbed as possible. Who knew that the Co-Q10 I've been taking all these years wasn't being absorbed well? I didn't!I take over 12 supplements a day, and Co-Q10 has been one of the leading ones I've always taken. I feel that this particular blend from Jarrow will probably be much better absorbed than regular Co-Q10, particularly when I take it with food that has some fat in it. I like the Jarrow brand, since I've known and trusted them for years.
B0013OXABS I first tried DR. Mercola's brand Ubiquinol enhanced CoQ10 about a year ago. I never felt wow energy improvement but I did feel more awake and honestly lighter on my feet. I truly felt \"airy\" if that even makes sense. I noticed a differnce any time that I took them. My memory is not fantastic so I decided to get more and wanted to try the Jarrow brand.. really I got free shipping and two day delivery for free. Plus, the reviews we're great. Well, I have yet to notice any difference in energy or anything else since taking them.  I've been taking them for a week and nothing.I'm 29 years old and take prEtty good care of my health amd am very natural minded so I'm disappointed.  I read that mercola,'s formulation was the bestand now I agree.  Ill be sticking to his brand from now on.
B0013OXABS Not sure if this stuff works well or not as I don't know how to tell. These pills are ginormous. I take 3 a day. They are smooth, black, and really do go down easy. No side effects that I can tell. I take them per regiment suggested by Dr. Steven Sinatra for blood pressure issues.
B0013OXABS I've been taking some form of CoQ10 for several years for its cardiovascular and energizing benefits.  When sourcing CoQ10 (ubiquinol) it's vitally important to get a type that is actually ABSORBED into your bloodstream.  This form is highly absorbable.I like this higher 100 mg dosage of ubiquinol & can definitely feel a difference in energy levels on the days I take it.  This supplement is DEFINITELY on my list of favorites; highly recommended for its quality and effectiveness.See this book by Dr. Stephen Sinatra to learn what you need to know about CoQ10's importance to your health:Reverse Heart Disease Now: Stop Deadly Cardiovascular Plaque Before It's Too Late.  Good luck and good health to all!
B0013OXABS Everything I've read about this product I wanted....all the health benefits. I was eager to try it.  Unfortunately, after each dosage I got the worst, chest crushing heartburn ever.  I thought maybe it was something else, and experimented with taking it on an empty AND full stomach, as well as at different times of day.  I also ruled out other medication or foods that might have caused the heartburn.Still, no better.  Something about this doesn't agree with me and the pain of the heartburn couldn't be ignored. I had to stop taking it.
B0013OXABS I've been taking this for awhile and I feel a bit more alert, not miraculously but some.I've known and understood the profound benefits of Co-Q10 for several years now and also paid quite a bit more for it.  \"Ubiquinol QH\" is touted as a \"reduced form\" of Co-Q10-- not quite sure what that means.  Does it mean half the strength (so take double the amount for the effects of Co-Q10)?A very large \"soft\" pill that digests very easily.Good product.
B0013OXABS CO Q10 has been highly touted for some time to be an extraordinarily beneficial supplement.The additional Ubiquinol QH absorb Jarrow formula takes it a step further in providing an additional path to absorption, particularly as the user gets older.It has been stated that absorption levels decline with age.With that in mind, it is anticipated that this formula will be more beneficial.Cons are the price but every CO Q10 formula, worth its 'salt', has been pricey.
B0013OXABS Ubiquinol is a more readily absorbed by the body CoQ10 supplement. According to Wikipedia, it is available from food, but declines with age. According to scientific studies it is antiaging, helps prevent Alzheimer's, and helps the heart and also energy levels in older adults. That is why I take it. You can learn more about it at Wikipedia. I know that Jarrow is a reputable company and they offered a great price on this product, like $30.00 less a bottle than I had been paying. I am very happy with this product.
B0013OXABS Just turned the big 5-0 and i'm in good shape (healthwise) but lately I've been feeling tired and listless. Sometimes to the point of total slothfulness. I was just going to attribute it to getting old. I've known about Co-Q-10 for some time now. But I'd stop taking it as it as not absorbable and expensive. When I saw this product I figured, why not?Mistakenly took a pill at 7pm and eyes popped open at 4am FULL OF ENERGY. Wow. Took another this morning at 8am and within 30 min or so BAM again. Placebo effect? Don't know, but whatever it is I like it!
B0013OXABS Ubiquinol is a form of Coenzyme Q-10 that is better absorbed. Clinical studies have found that it holds great promise in improving cardiovascular, renal and oral health as well as male fertility. It improves energy and may help in slowing the aging process.I found the soft gels easy to swallow with no discernible side effects. At this juncture it is hard to guage any benefits. Overall Jarrow is a reliable company that produces high quality products. I do feel bet
B0013OXABS I have been taking this cardiovascularly protective supplement for years and will continue to do so.  Great product, easy to swallow gel cap.
B0013OXABS For the most part, I've been happy with products I've tried from Jarrow. Lately I've been taking things that I don't even really need just to see if they help me out in any way. To be honest, I didn't even know what Ubiquinol was until I got my package in the mail. Energy isn't a problem of mine, though there are days when I'm not feeling all that lively, regardless of how much sleep I had the night before. I started taking a dose of Ubiquinol each day, and haven't noticed any side effects, or any real benefits for that matter aside from the fact that I haven't been having any of those \"down' days any more. This could be in part to me exercising more regularly than I was at the start of the year (I started taking Ubiquinol at the end of February), so I can't say for sure.As it is, the pills are easy to swallow with water, don't have any strange taste to them, and the fact that you're getting some good CoQ-10 in here, which aids blood flow and lets more oxygen get to your brain, and you've got a nice little supplement. Some people I know who've tried this stuff have mentioned that it makes them more alert and awake soon after taking it. Keep that in mind so you don't take a dose a little bit before bedtime or anything.
B0013OXABS Jarrow is a fine company, and they always produce high quality products. I highly recommend this product. My only complaint, if you can call it that, is that I would really love to buy these in a 300 mg soft gel. Right now I take 3 soft gels per day, so I would love the convenience of a larger dose.
B0013OXABS How can you judge how well a supplement is working? You can't! However, I have read that Ubiquinol is better than regular CoQ10 in general and I have trusted Jarrow over a few years, so I have nothing bad to say.
B0013OXABS There are rave reviews and suggestions we should take these to maintain heart health.  My husband and I take these on a daily basis but have stopped taking supplements except calcium, d, c, and multivitamins to see if ubiquinol is one of the causes for his headache.  I haven't had a health check up so I'm not sure if this supplement helps or not.  I'm in my late 30's with good health for the most part.  For better health the best thing you can do is eat right and exercise.  Supplements can be expensive and visiting the docs.
B0013OXABS I really like this brand of Ubiquinol.  Very high quality and would highly recommend if you are looking for something to try.
B0013OXABS This ubiquinol is a nice product at a good price.As people get older, their natural supply of coq10 drops, and they have difficulty converting coq10 to ubiquinol, which is an important to help produce cellular energy and to fight free radicals.  In fact, some benefits of ubiquinal are supposedly:  heart health, anti-aging, blood pressure reduction, fight free-radicals, boost immune system and support nervous system, much of this supported by various scientific literature.  Ubiquinol can be directly absorbed, and hence there is some literature stating that people over age 40 should consider supplementing with it.I can't speak to all the alleged health claims, but I can say that I do _think_ I have more energy due to the ubiquinol supplementation.The Jarrow pills are a decent size and swallow easily.  The price is good.  What's not to like?
B0013OXABS When it comes to taking supplements, my stomach usually says \"no!\"  In addition to this, there are many foods that I can't eat so I am always searching for new products that could help me and not throw my stomach into a turmoil.Thus far I have not been disappointed by Ubiquinol QH-Absorb 100 mg, 60 Softgels.  At the present time, I am only taking one per day but I have noticed that I have more energy.  In time, I will increase the dosage and see what happens. Give this product a try; I believe it will make a difference. Believe me, my stomach could get a job as a vitamin or supplement tester. But everyone is different so check with your health provider.
B0013OXABS I've been taking this for several weeks and have noticed that my energy level is at a consistently higher level. In addition, QH-absorb(the reduced form of Co-Q10) has been shown to improve heart health and function(as well as to lower blood pressure). There are other various immune and antioxidant benefits but the supplement needs be taken consistently and over a long period in order to attain the beneficial results.
B0013OXABS CoQ10 is a top supplement that probably everyone over 40 should take. This is a very good price per dose and Jarrow products are always high quality.
B0013OXABS I consider this to one of the of key supplements on my must take daily list. Coenzyme q10 is essential for optimal cell function and decreases as we age. If you are taking a cholesterol lowering drug it is even more important to take as statins lower the amount of CQ10 the liver makes. The Ubiquinol version is superior in that it allows your body to actually absorb the stuff more efficiently. So to summarize, if you've decided to supplement with coq10, this is the product to take. It may be a little more expensive but you are more likely to get the benefits in this form.
B0013OXABS I have taken this dosage of CO-Q as Ubiquinol for a few years so I can't say that these are more or less effective. From what I've read, if you are over 40 you want to take Ubiquinol (reduced Co-Q10) rather than regular CO-Q. I was surprised to find that even though these soft gels were of the same strength as my other brand, they were very large compared to the tiny football shaped gels I usually take. They are roughly 1 inch by just under 5/8's of an inch. If you have issue's swallowing pills these are probably not for you. They also contain more ingredients than I am used to seeing, medium chain trilycerides, phoshatidylcholine (from soy), beeswax, rosmanic acid, vitamin E and ascrblyl palmitate. They are gluten free and nut free for those of you with allergies but they do not say GMO free. Though Jarrow is a good company, almost all of the soy grown in the U.S. contains GMO's. I will stop taking these for that reason.
B0013OXABS I am a real fan of Jarrow Formulas Products.  You just cannot beat the quality, and this form of coenzyme Q-10 did not disappoint.I'm a big believe in Q-10 for heart protection, and it's a must for those taking statins or niacin for high cholesterol.  It will help protect you from the muscle weakness/aches that sometimes accompany statin use.The form of Q-10 available in Jarrows has been proven in clinical studies to absorb better in our blood stream than other forms of Q-10.  I highly recommend this product if you want to start taking Q-10.  It is also gluten, dairy, egg and fish free - something you can't say with some other brands.  Highly recommended.
B0013OXABS This is a highly-absorbable &#34;reduced form&#34; of CoQ10 (anti-oxidant). According to Jarrow it has &#34;enhanced stability.&#34; It is a fairly large softgel, so if you have difficulty swallowing, this might not be the pill for you. It's close to an inch long.I always like to cut capsules open to see exactly what I'm putting in my body. Inside of this one is a light greenish thin oily, slightly stinky liquid. Although it's slightly stinky, it does not create any bad burps like fish oil pills. The soft shell consists of gelatin, glycerin, and water, so not considered vegetarian if you avoid glycerin.Serving suggestion is 1 per day, although you can take up to 1 soft gel three times per day.
B0013OXABS This product was recommended by a cardiologist that uses as many natural supplements as is possible to avoid pharmaceuticals. I can only go by the blood work and the doctor's report that I am in good health. It was recommended for heart elasticity maintenance.
B0013OXABS This is a natural supplement that helps boost your energy at the celluar level. I found it to be very effective.
B0013OXABS First looking at one of these gel tablets is pretty daunting, as they are large and if taken without water can be hard to swallow.But whatever is in this tablet is effective.  If you need an energy boost this will provide one.  After a few trials of this product I've decided to take these only when needed because my body takes a while to burn off this excess, and staying up all night because I took one of these is not my idea of good rest.
B0013OXABS I haven't noticed much of an energy boost after taking this twice a day (with food), but my mood has definitely improved. I am a pretty irritable person, and after taking these for a little while, I have started to feel better. My heart is also not racing as much since using this.There have been no major side effects of taking these, though I did get a tiny headache and felt slightly queasy after taking these the first day. After that, I have had no problems. The pills are large, but are the soft gel kind, so no problems swallowing them. I really like Jarrow products, never been disappointed.
B0013OXABS great product, great price.  I chose this because of our statin use.  It is a good way to replace the coq10 lost from taking statins.  The softgels are easy to swallow and the product is high quality.
B0013OXABS These Jarrow Ubiquinol OH-Absorb 100mg Softgels is a great way of getting CoQ10, which is recommended to protect the heart for those of us as we age and are on statins. CoQ10 is an antioxidant, has been shown to help with digestion, the absorbing of nutrients, and also provides an \"energy boost. While i can't confirm any of the above claims, other then the mild energy boost, my on-line research shows that most of the claims seem to be credible.These pills are VERY large, but not cartoonish, and ironically should be taken with fatty foods.Highly Recommended!CFH
B0013OXABS This helped with my chest pains.  It's a more easily absorbed version of Co-Q10.  It may help to take fish oil with it.
B0013OXABS CQ10 is found in many foods such as sardines, liver, beef and nuts. It is highly antioxidant and in many cases, can be a heart healthy supplement. I found my energy levels did increase with this product. I have previously taken this supplement but not this type of QH Absorb which is a highly concentrated form of CQ10. You have to take this with a good meal or it will come back up on you or give you heartburn. You also have to be able to swallow a good sized pill. For my needs, I take the supplement every other day. I do take Red Yeast Rice which is like a statin, so this supplement is beneficial for that reason. CQ10 is in all of our cells but as we age, they do not regenerate as quickly. This is a good product for over people 50-or over 35 which I have also read.Research notes that this product has also shown good results with Parkinsons, diabetes, certain heart problems and can help to lower cholestrol. It can also help people who have sun damaged skin. If taking supplements bothers you, ask your doctor first and see if he/she would recommend Ubiquinol. I think as an antioxidant, it is a very good supplement.
B0013OXABS I'm not saying it replaces high quality coffee but it does give energy.  One issue with Co-Q10 supplements is absorption.  This product raises the body's Co-Q10 levels, and that adds energy.Most of us have too much free radical production and too much inflammation.  The way to compensate for that is to get plenty of antioxidants.  Fruits and vegetables are great - when they're grown locally and therefore picked at the right time.  Ok, so that's not possible for me unless my budget was different.  It costs money to stay healthy even though habits like avoiding soft drinks matter a whole lot.The body can regenerate these antioxidants using the enzyme Co-Q10 - this is backed by scientific studies.  This also restores energy levels to the body.  This supplement helps me.  I'll continue taking it.
B0013OXABS I have taken the CoQ10 and have felt better for it, more stamina and energy. This Ubiquinol is said to work better/faster...that is yet to be seen as I've only been taking it for a couple of days. I like the Jarrow Formula brand of vitamins and minerals, and take many of their products, as I am \"of a certain age\" where heart health is more of a concern, my Doctor agreed that this was a good product for me to take.
B0013OXABS Ubiquinol is also referred to as coenzyme Q10 and has many known potential benefits.- Reduction in migraines- Supports overal heart health- Potential reduction in blood pressure- Potentially effective in treating types of cancer and cancer treatment side-effects.- and several other potential benefitsThe challenge with Ubiquinol/Coenzyme Q10 supplements is finding ways for the body absorb and utilize the supplement. The Jarrow Ubiquinol is a soft gel capsule (although it is a LARGE soft gel capsule) to help facilitate absorption. The capsule are actually colored to help ensure that light does not breakdown the Q10.My experience - Again the Jarrow Ubiquinol is one of the largest pills that I have every swallowed. The recommend dosage is 1-3 per day, but so far I have stuck with just a day. As you would expect, most of the benefits are best observed on a long-term basis, but I have not noticed any negative side effects.Final Verdict- The Jarrow Forumla Ubiquinol seems to be an effective method of Coenzyme Q10 delivery. The soft gel capsule is pretty large, but it seems to have been designed to help your body get the maximum benefit.5 Stars
B0013OXABS My vet recommended ubiquinol for my 12 year old chihuahua who has developed a heart murmur.  I researched it online and was impressed with the reviews and personal experiences I found, so when Vine provided me with a sample of it I was excited to try it.  Ollie, my chihuahua, is only 4 pounds so I poke a hole in the gelcap and squeeze a little on his food in the morning and evening, so a gelcap lasts about three days.  He doesn't seem to even notice the taste and he eats every bit of his food, so I know he's eating the entire dose each meal.  After several months, it seems to be working - he's seems much more energetic and even perky, which makes my very happy.I was so impressed with his results that I've started taking it myself.  I've only been taking it about a month, but I feel as though I have more energy during my workouts.  I've already ordered more for myself and for Ollie so I'll update this review with any new developments._______________________________________________March 29, 2013So Ollie (my little dog) and I have been taking this every day for about 5 months.  I didn't plan my \"subscribe & save\" well and we ran out about two weeks ago.  I started to notice about a week ago that Ollie had gotten really lethargic and after a few days I began to suspect that it was because of the lack of ubiquinol (the difference in his energy level is dramatic.)  And then I realized that I've been lethargic also!  I have been having trouble waking up for the past week and have overslept several times.  In the past four months before running out of the ubiquinol I have awakened with energy almost every morning and my energy has been really good throughout the day - I even commented to my partner how good I had been feeling.I can't say for certain that it's the ubiquinol, but it's rather coincidental that within a week of running out of it, both my dog and I have been experiencing extremely low energy.  I won't be able to say with any real certainty until we start taking it again on a daily basis after my order comes.  I'll update this again after we've both been on it for awhile again and I'll let you know if we gotten our respective energy levels back._______________________________________________September 7, 2013Both Ollie and I are feeling better.  I will make sure to never run out of this again!PS - It always makes my day to know that people find these reviews helpful. If you'd also like to ask a question or leave a comment I usually respond the same day, so if you have a question or comment (even if it's just to say, Hi!\") feel free to post it below.Thanks,Claire
B0013OXABS Having been recently diagnosed with Atrial Fibrillation, research shows that this is an effective supplement to help restore protect the heart from damage caused by the disease.  While this is not something I can measure in the short run or even attribute to the supplement in the long run, I am willing to add it to my daily regimen.According to the Mayo Clinic, CoQ10 has studied for numerous conditions, but remains controversial as a treatment in many areas.  Here are some of the areas where a possibility of positive effect has been seen:* Heart health - reducing risk of heart attacks and increasing survival rate* Migraine headaches - to prevent migraines* Cancer - as a treatment for cancer and for relief from treatment side-effects* Blood Pressure - potential to lower systolic readingAfter consuming the bottle at one per day for two months, I switched to a 400mg version that I take daily.  Although I already have very low blood pressure, particularly when my heart is in AFib, the supplement has not made my blood pressure any lower.  I do have skin cancer so it will be great if this supplement decreases my yearly surgeries.  Fortunately I don't suffer from headaches because Tylenol (the only pain killer I can take) does nothing.I had no problems with the size, no after-taste or indigestion, and no side-effects from the supplement.  According to the research, nothing supports the improved periodontal health or increased energy reported by some of the other reviewers.
B0013OXABS I have been told by nutritionists to take this and have read so too. I notice nothing from it but I haven't had a heart attack so guess it work.
B0013OXABS I've been taking this for about three weeks now and I do feel a bump up in my energy level. As far as the other things are concerned I can't tell the difference but I will be monitoring my health and having bloods drawn soon and I'll let you know what is going on.
B0013OXABS I have been using this liquid CoQ10 (Qunol) for about 3 years (I run and do elliptical) and that made a difference, as I do a lot of interval work, and I found that it made a difference in how quickly I bounced back. The annoying thing is that it was expensive and I'd forget to take it, since I couldn't just put it with all the other pills (has to be kept cold).I thought I'd give this a shot and I like it because I can't tell any difference between this and the liquid I was using. This is much less expensive, must less hassle, and since it seems to work as well I have no issues.I also like the fact that it's a Jarrow product, as I've been using their Quercetin for a few years and it works well and their pricing seems fair.
B0013OXABS I take many supplements. With the addition of Ubiquinol QH my good cholesterol raised, bad cholesterol lowered, and triglycerides lowered. I can't prove the credit goes here but it is the only change I made.
B0013OXABS Ubiquinol is supposed to be better absorbed and utilized than plain old Co-Enzyme Q10 (ubiquinone).I am 34, and have been taking Co-Enzyme Q10 for about ten years now. Studies show that ubiquinol is better absorbed and more effective than plain old CoQo10/ubiquinone (although one study showed that straight Co-Enzyme Q10 paired with lecithin doubled absorption). So, as a rule, a little ubiquinol has more of an effect than a lot of ubiquinone.I haven't \"felt\" anything from taking this, or from CoQ10 over the last ten years. However, I believe that taking this supplement (and quite a few others), exercising regularly, being calm and happy, and eating right is having an unseen effect on me, by preventing problems down the road. Sure it is an anecdote, but I have more physical and mental energy at 34 than I did at 18. Again, I am not implying it is the result of ubiquinone or ubiquinol, but studies do show that ubiquinol reduces inflammation, improves kidney health, and improves cardiovascular functioning.Before considering any supplement, price has to be factored in. In terms of supplements, prices of the same chemical vary widely across companies. Overall, ubiquinol is quite a bit more expensive than CoQ10. When discounted online, Jarrow ubiquinol is reasonably priced compared to other brands, even factory store brands, so the price is pretty good.Overall, if you want to explore the benefits of ubiquinol for yourself, this is a great product.
B0013OXABS I ordered this because it was highly recommended by Dr. Oz in the 100mg dose. Not this brand, just this dose.My blood work is now perfect! I had been taking it in the morning for about 6 months, before my last blood test.
B0013OXABS I can't discuss this product clinically or biochemically&mdash;but Jarrow does a very good job of that, so I don't have to. What I can tell you is how I think it will work in our household.These are horse pills, but they are soft horse pills. I have trouble swallowing harder \"caplet\" type pills that are smaller than these, but the QH-absorb pill went down easily with liquid. I think I'd rather take one big pill than a lot of little pills anyway. But I'm not the one who will be taking these; DH, who had a heart attack last year and has major cardiac problems, will. It remains to be seen if he'll actually take them, but I don't know why he wouldn't. CoQ10 and fish oil are the two supplements he's been told he should take by his doctor. (I'll nag him at dinner, because you're supposed to take these with food.)Although they do contain soy (lecithin), these pills do not contain wheat, gluten, dairy, egg, fish/shellfish, or peanuts/tree nuts, so majorly allergic DH ought to be fine with them. I have found the Jarrow brand to be reliable.
B0013OXABS I have looked around the internet for a few weeks and found this on Amazon.  It is the best stuff for the human cell!  And they have an auto send system that is quite good.  You sign up for the product to be sent to you every 30/60/90 days and just before they send you the stuff, they send an email to you and you can accept and delay the shipment.  Really a good system.  And the product is great too.
B0013OXABS I take Ubiquinol for my heart and circulation and switched from Co-Q 10 when I learned about Ubiquinol's being superior.  I feel that it protects my heart and is a good product.
B0013OXABS After a triple by-pass I take heart health very serious.  Excellent product with a good price point.  No issues with this product!  Excellent
B0013OXABS Like all supplements, it's hard to tell if you need it or if it works.  However, I'm very happy with the price, packaging and prompt delivery. My doctor had been recommending the product because I have muscle problems due to taking LDL reducing drugs. I noticed a slight improvement with the GNC product but I feel this brand is even better or I'm just exercising more. Hard to tell. I love the fact that it was half the price. My doctor had suggested that I buy the product online. I do find the pill slightly larger than the GNC gelcap, thus the reason for 4 stars.
B0013OXABS Ubiquinol is a high absorption Coenzyme Q-10.Possible side effects; Headache, Gastrointestinal Upset and DiarrheaCapsules are almost one inch by a half inch HORSE PILLS.While I (age 50) had no side effects I also evidenced no benefits after taking one pill daily for 3 months.
B0013OXABS I'm not 50.  I'm still in my early 40's.  But I have been feeling a bit tired and run down, even though I'm sleeping well at night.So, Ubiquinol.  It's supposed to help, right?  Well, I started off with 1 pill a day at breakfast.  No noticeable results.  So, two pills a day; one with breakfast, one with dinner.  Slight result.  I'm not going to go for more pills a day than that after reading about folks having side effects.That's my deal, tho, not yours.The larger issue: these pills are a bit on the big side.  However, since they're gels, they're easier for your body to absorb.Your results may vary, but I'll keep taking them.  Any improvement is good by me!
B0013OXABS Jarrow is a well trusted brand & have yet to be disappointed in any of their products.  I'm adding this to my daily arsenal of supplements after reading about Ubiquninol being better for adsorption after you pass 40 or so.  I look forward to improved memory, but also read some recent studies where this may also help lower your LDL cholesterol.  Time will tell!
B0013OXABS I make sure to take these with a fatty food for best absorption. I do notice after about 1/2 hour after swallowing (these are quite large!)I feel I have more energy that winds down slowly (no crash). I try not to take a pill after 2pm as I notice I have trouble falling asleep (I got to bed around 10pm).  I know this is more for heart health - so honestly, I can't valuate for that as I don't have heart problems or any pre/post health reports to compare them to. Because I do feel I'm more energetic, I feel they do at least work to help with energy. At first, I felt this wasn't working, but when I did some research and read some of the reviews - it was suggested to take this with a fatty food - this made a huge difference to me and that's when it started to work - so if you don't feel you're having luck with this, make sure you take this with some fatty food (I usually take with an egg fried in butter) or some peanut butter.
B0013OXABS Jarrow has done it again with this easy to absorb CoQ10 vitamin supplement. This one is big but seemed easy for me to swallow since the ends are tapered.  It absorbs better in your body. coQ10 has increased my energy levels tremendiously, and this is great for your heart. See my pic above QUARTER - Ubiquinol QH-absorb 1\" long  6/16\" wide - BAYER ADVANCED 325 ASPRIN
B0013OXABS Before trying this product, I'd never heard of ubiquinone and I had no idea that this might be something an individual would want to supplement. According to the product description, ubiquinone acts like an anti-oxidant by facilitating the movement of protons and electrons, thereby also supporting the generation of energy in the body. (Without an advanced degree in chemistry, biology, or physiology, the average person would be hard pressed to discern much more than that from the product description or manufacturer's website.) That sounds pretty logical and harmless to me, so I gave it a try.The capsules are rather large gel-filled (I think) things, but they are easy enough to swallow, especially for a runner like myself who already takes a number of meds and supplements every morning. I didn't notice any ill effects, such as odorous burps, upset stomach, or such. Not surprisingly, after three weeks of taking these things, I also haven't noticed any particular effect like increased energy or more pep or anything like that. As for anti-oxidant effects, well, check back with me in 30 years and if I haven't died of cancer, maybe Ubiquinol helped. (Maybe.)For someone looking for a ubiquinone supplement, I make this one to be as good as any. I don't, however, think this is anything special that the average person needs to consume for better health or well-being.
B0013OXABS Jarrow Formulas Ubiquinol QH-Absorb does the job. It seems to be the cheapest ubiquinol on the market.  Ubiquinol's primary roles are in the synthesis of cellular (bodily) energy and as a protective antioxidant slowing down aging. It can also significantly increase the volume of blood pumped out of the heart's ventricle, as well as benefit the neurological system including the brain. The antioxidant effect of ubiquinol could counteract not only periodontal inflammatory processes substantially improving oral health of those prone to  periodontitis, but also chronic kidney disease, and maybe even male infertility.
B0013OXABS This product is great!  Have noticed more energy, and my heart feels stronger.  Since taking this product I have noticed no heart palpitations!  Ubiquinol is wonderful, and this brand is a really good one!
B0013OXABS If you do research on Coenzyme Q-10 you will soon realize that Ubiquinol has greater antioxidant efficiency than the ubiquinone form that a majority of Q10 products contain. Ubiquinol is, of course, more expensive. Jarrow, as well as being a dependable source, has offered a very well made and well priced Q10.
B0013OXABS Before I switched to a better diet and fish oil supplements, my cholesterol level was high, so my doctor prescribed a statin drug.  What I wasn't prepared for was the fatigue I felt from taking the medication. I did some research and discovered that CoQ10 supplements could help with that-- apparently statin drugs hinder the body's normal ability to absorb CoQ10.  Subsequent research revealed that Ubiquinol was the best form of CoQ10. So that's what I started taking.  Fast forward a few years, a much better diet, good supplements, and I no longer need the medication.  But, I still want to take Ubiquinol for the energy boost.  This is a great formula.  No side effects, and despite being a little smelly, no stomach issues.  (For what it's worth, a doctor friend of mine told me that cardiologists \"take Ubiquinol like candy\"-- they must know something...) This brand is well-respected and I will continue to use it.
B0013OXABS I've been reading for years that the supplement CoQ10 is a good choice for reducing cancer risk and increasing energy. Apparently it's a really important antioxidant in fighting aging, both inside the body and in fighting the obvious signs of aging on your skin.Because I've been feeling a little tired lately, I decided to start taking CoQ10 as a supplement to see if it helps. I began with a different brand and didn't notice much difference. It's very possible the CoQ10 was doing a good job, but I didn't feel anything.I then read that ubiquinol is a better form of CoQ10 for those over 30, because most CoQ10 supplements still need to be activated by the body, and people over 30 can have trouble activating the CoQ10 on their own.Though ubiquinol is more expensive than regular CoQ10, I certainly felt the difference in my energy levels over the past week that I have been taking them, and nothing else in my diet or supplement regimen has changed. I've been a lot more productive, and have been able to get more done despite that usual sleepiness I feel every January.The softgels are pretty much odorless, and I've read that ubiquinol supplements should be taken with a meal that contains some healthy fats. Overall, I'm really happy with this supplement and would certainly recommend that anyone over 30 like myself choose ubiquinol over a regular CoQ10 supplement. I trust the Jarrow brand because whenever I read something highly specific and geeky about nutrition, I can generally find the product in the Jarrow lineup.
B0013OXABS Jarrow Formulas Ubiquinol QH-Absorb is a formulation of the substance most of us know as CoQ10, which is associated with cell metabolism; people keep telling me that they are taking it for some relief of the symptoms of CFIDS, but your mileage may vary. I feel better and spend more time out of bed. The softgels are large, but they don't stick in my throat, and if I can swallow them, that's pretty good. I think it's well worth trying, and it may become a regular part of my routine.
B0013OXABS I used to but my CO-Q10 at Costco but buying this great product on Amazon is much more convenient. Lets hope it keeps me healthy.....so far so good!
B0013OXABS My husband takes this at the recommendation of his physician.  He has had no untoward side effects and it was recommended to us by the supplement specialist at our local organic grocery co-op.
B0013OXABS It's hard to review vitamins and each person's unique chemistry makes judging the effect ever more challenging. I didn't notice a perceivable positive or negative effect and would appreciate more peer reviewed studies to further my understanding. I would say this is a completely neutral review at 3 stars with neither an endorsement or detachment in the product.
B0013OXABS I have loved almost every Jarrow's product I found. But this one I will take a pass on. I tired this and the Red Rice Yeast product with Co-Q10. This product is much more obnoxious that the Red Rice yeast. It tastes bad going down. In fact it is the only Jarrow product that has had a bad taste. Then it made my stomach hurt. It wasn't just a little stomach ache either.I discontinued after 4 days. I am not sure what possible benefit this product has but my stomach hurt too much to stick with it.
B0013OXABS If you have trouble swallowing pills, these will scare you.  I've never seen pills so large.  But I've not had any trouble getting them down and they \"seem\" to be working.But I put \"seem\" in quotes for a reason...Is this supplement really giving me more energy, or is it just that Spring is coming, or just because I've changed my diet a bit, or just because I've made an adjustment in my work load, or just because I've started taking Jarrow's SAM-e 400?  But, bottom line:  I DO have more energy, and I'm NOT feeling any ill-effects from these pills.  So, what's not to like?I am going to state the obvious: Day by day we age. What are never obvious to me are the changes taking place in my body; it all (usually) happens so slowly that I don't notice the changes. To me, not being aware of the changes, not seeing any obvious changes, is a problem. So when I read that this product supplemented what my aging body no longer produced, I thought I'd give it a try. I thought if I noticed any obvious improvement, I'd be on the right track to helping my body grow old gracefully and I could rationalize the expense of these supplements.Judging the benefits of supplements is always going to be a subjective exercise: Who knows what outside variables--other than the added supplement--are affecting how you feel on any particular day? But I think that, even knowing and accepting that thought, we all make some kind of a judgment call.Having said all that: I like this product. I believe I felt its benefits almost immediately. I feel I have more pep and my movements are quicker and smoother, and require less effort.
B0013OXABS After reading about this and the effects it can help with I decided to give it a shot and review it, especially since it can help with energy, something I'm always low on. Well granted I'm only 33, but I do have fibermyalgia so this can really make me tired, achy, and low energy a lot. While I take meds for this, they mostly help for pain, nothing for energy, and I liked this also since it has extra health additives and supplements in it. It definitely gives me added energy, nothing crazy, didn't make my heart race or anything like metabolizing pills I've tried in thepast, and that's with taking up to three a day of these as recommended. I was worried about size at first, but the gel tab went right down no problem. No funny gag smell either! I also didn't have an issue with not being able to sleep or being too wired on these. The price is a bit high on them so I probably wouldn't buy them, but as far as reviewing them I do like them. Definitly better than drinking energy drinks and healthier too!
B0013OXABS This product (Jarrow Formules Ubiquinaol QH-Absorb) did not work for me,I took it along with my Centrum multivitamin and did not notice a difference, after trying it for a week.I'll just stick with my normal vitamins.These might work better for others, they just did'nt work for me.
B0013OXABS I've taken Q10 for a couple of years and basically took it on \"good faith\" that it was doing anything. I've had other friends that reported great results with Q10 but frankly, I never noticed anything. No change in heart rhythym, no reduction in arrythmia, nothing. Still, I took it daily. Then I read a few reports about how poorly typical Q10 is absorbed and how ubiquinol is supposed to be more readily available and thought I'd give this a try. I still can't say with assurance that it makes a huge difference but in general, think this does seem to have more impact that Q10 especially during times of higher exertion such as at the gym etc... Given the current state of the science, I'd be more inclined to stick with ubiquinol over q10 in the future.
B0013OXABS This is the best product I ever bought out of all the supplements that I buy.  I feel good.  I
B0013OXABS I have chosen Jarrow for years for their product quality/prices.  I chose soft gels as they are easy to swallow and are absorbed quickly.I chose the ubiquinol form of Co-Q10 over the standard form (ubiquinone) for reasons explained by Jarrow including that the standard form is \"less efficient in some individuals, based on age or genetics.\" and that \"Ubiquinol also has superior bioavailability to ubiquinone, as demonstrated in clinical trials\".Edit Nov 2012:  I just saw Dr. Weil (on Dr. Oz Season 4 Episode 49) say he prefers gel form because it absorbs better and he also said they should be taken with a meal that contains fat as it is fat soluble and it therefore needs fat to be absorbed.
B0013OXABS Jarrow Formulas Ubiquinol is a 5 star product in my book...  in fact in the bookThe Sinatra Solution: Metabolic Cardiologythe importance of co-enzyme Q10 in all cardiac related matters is revealed, but for those of us who are 40+ and or have serious chronic metabolic issues should consider the more readily bioavailable form known as Ubiquinol, one of which is known as Kaneka Ubiquinol which is the form here in Jarrow Formulas. My husband and I have both found that ubiquinol is not only key to help normalize our blood pressure, but it played a crucial role in reversing his end stage severe congestive heart failure. Additionally it is becoming common knowledge that statin drugs (used for cholesterol maintenance or lowering) deplete co-enzyme Q10 causing a host of symptoms including muscle and joint pain, back pain, hand pain, etc so many doctors are recommending their patients supplement CoQ10 (or in this case ubiquinol) when taking statin drugs including a primary care in our doctor's office.According to the package, the ingredients include: \"Medium chain triglycerides, phosphatidyl-choline (from soy lecithin), beeswax, rosmarinic acid, vitamin E, and ascorbyl palmitate. Softgel consists of gelatin, glycerin and water. Carob extract and caramel added as a light barrier. Contains: Soy. No wheat, no gluten, no dairy, no egg, no fish/shellfish, no peanuts/tree nuts.  Particle formation inside softgel is normal and dissolves after ingestion.\" The package does NOT state which form of Vitamin E is included, the natural \"d-alpha\" form or the synthetic \"dl-alpha\" form. The package states to take 1 - 3 softgels per day, however the lower dose should be fine for many.For those who plan to use high-dose Ubiquinol long-term or on a family basis (our senior German Shepherd Dog even takes ubiquinol as maintenance) may want to consider purchasing in bulk in which case other options to be considered includesNutraBulk KANEKA Ubiquinol 50mg Soft Gels 1000 Count. The Jarrow Formula 100 mg Ubiquinol softgels are many times larger in size than the tiny Nutrabulk 50 mg ubiquinol soft gels - this is relevant for anyone who has difficulty swallowing larger softgels.
B0013OXABS Ubiquinol is a more easily absorbed form of COQ10 so it is a superior supplement.  The body uses up 500 mg of COQ10 per day, and the body's production of COQ10 slows down with aging.  This substance is vital for heart health and for keeping the entire body young and healthy.  It should be on your list of top 5 supplements to take every day.  If you have high cholesterol, skip the statins and supplement with ubiquinol.
B0013OXABS I like Jarrow Formuals Ubiquinol QH because it is twice as effective as CoQ10, but at thrice the price, it is not entirely economical.  The pills are somewhat large, but easy to swallow due to their softgel exterior.  The don't have a taste and they did not produce any negative effects.  If you don't mind spending a little extra to take fewer pills with better stability, then this supplement is for you.
B0013OXABS One of those supplements that should be a part of your health stack, especially if over the age of 35 or taking statins.The ubiquinol form is superior than regular CoQ10, so while per pill is more expensive, your body will utilize a higher amount of it.We also give these to our Great Danes since they are known to have heart problems.
B0013OXABS WARNING if you are diabetic.  This product raised my blood sugar into unsafe levels.  I checked with webmd and found that this is a problem with Ubiquinol in general and not specific to the Jarrow product.  Still, i think they should have made this clear as part of the product description.  I won't use it again because of the problem with diabetes, but if you don't have don't have diabetes the product appears to work otherwise.
B0013OXABS Despite the large size of the gel caps (see below), these go down very smoothly, with no hard edges. The pill is heavy enough to swallow without having to gulp it down. Take a big mouthful of water with it and it's fine. There is no taste in the mouth, or aftertaste. These are nice quality pills.Size:These are on the big side of gel caps. I measures 3 and a half centimeters long (about an inch) and a full centimeter wide.Appearance:Black cylinders with tapered round ends and a center seam.In the bottle:60 softcaps. Depending on whether you take one, two or three a day, the bottle should last two months, one month, or a half a month.What's in the pill:Since the gels are almost totally opaque, I can't report what it looks like inside the capsule. The ingredients list says that carob extract and caramel are added to each gel as a protective light barrier. I'd say they do the job.The bottle reports 1 softgel contains 100mg of Ubiquinol. Supposedly Ubiquinol is a more digestible form of Co-Q10. While the name Ubiquinol sounds like a scientific in-joke (ie - ubiquitous), multiple studies are referenced indicating that C0-Q10 does help slow down aging.I have a few notes that I wrote on the top of the bottle in Sharpie, to remind myself when to take them and  what for:- Take daily for antiaging- Take as needed for energy- Take with food- Take 1-3 a day- Do not take before bed (anecdotal reviews imply it keeps people awake in the evening)What I do:I am taking one a day at lunch with my other oil-soluble supplements. For extra energy, as needed, I take one or 2 as-needed.I've totally stopped aging.Okay, that would be an untruth. There really isn't a way to do at-home testing of supplement efficacy, and only anecdotal evidence would apply to my very unscientific review. Ask your doctor if she would recommend adding Co-Q10 to your diet.
B0013OXABS Jarrow Ubiquinol QH-absorb is Kaneka QH Ubiquinol, which is, as we are told at kanekaqh dot com, \"the only ubiquinol available for use in supplements and is manufactured exclusively by Kaneka Corporation.\" Jarrow is one of over 3 dozen supplement wholesalers that markets Kenaka QH under their brand name.I recommend that anyone looking for more information about this product visit the Keneka QH site as well as the WebMD pages on Coenzyme Q10 (ubiquinol is an electron-rich form of coenzyme Q10).Taking Jarrow QH-absorb seems to boost my energy, enough so that I avoid taking it after noon due to fear it will contribute to insomnia, and it seems to make me better able to concentrate and focus.Jarrow Formulas is held in high regard in the natural food industry. Jarrow has won many awards from a number of journals and magazines geared toward natural food, nutrition and vitamin industry insiders. Based on my experience in the industry (I operated natural food co-ops and for-profit stores from the mid-70's into the early 90's) and my familiarity with Jarrow brand supplements (I've used and continue to use quite a few), I rank Jarrow highly among supplement brands in terms of quality and fair pricing.
B0013OXABS As I finished my last Q10 supplement, I thought I would try this one.  I like that it's supposed to better absorbed.  The other one was chewable and tolerable as such.  This one is a huge softgel.  The chewable would be better for someone having difficulties swallowing a huge pill and also for getting smaller doses.  I didn't have any troubles swallowing this softgel.1 softgel is 100 mg.  1-3 a day are suggested.  So this 60 softgels is 20-60 days worth depending on dosage.Ingredients include soy which can be an issue for people will a soy allergy.Thing to know that the bottle doesn't say that I learned from research:  Consult your doctor if you are taking Warfarin or other anticoagulant medications before taking this.  It is similar to vitamin K and vitamin K promotes blood clotting.  Also, this can cause lowering of blooding sugar, of concern for diabetics or people using medications that may lower glucose. It also can lower blood pressure.  And there is concern that antioxidant supplements may interfere with the effectiveness of chemotherapy drugs.  If any of those are issues for you because of other conditions or medications you are taking, you should consult your doctor.
B0013OXABS Ubiquinol is the antioxidant form of CoQ10, said to be a better form to take if you are older than 25, as it not necessary for you to convert Q10 to ubiquinone to be metabolized. However, it's also believed that if you are under 25, you actually do not absorb ubiquinol as well. So if you are young, this isn't for you and if you are older and want to include Co-Q10 in your diet as a supplement, this is the better form to take it.Ubiquinol is an anti-oxidant (protects cells from damage from free radicals), an adjunct to heart health and a boost to the nervous system, brain and immune system.These gel caps are easy to swallow; I'm not a fan of gulping tablets and softgels are easier for me.
B0013OXABS Best value for the money!
B0013OXABS The very expensive CoQ10 I took in the past didn't provide any long term effects and I don't know if theQH Absorb 100 mg 60 softgelswill either, but I'm giving it a try.  Not having my Ubiquinol levels done, I don't know for sure.  I decided to take one softgel at mid-day and have had no problems thus far.  Taking statins, I'm hoping the Ubiquinol offers a benefit, particularly since I eat no meat which has more Ubiquinol.  Jarrow Formulas supplements have done well for me in the past and I'm hoping to tolerate this supplement as well.  The cost of these is much less than the previous CoQ10, too.
B0013OXABS Jarrow's 100 mg Ubiquinol QH-Absorb is a larger capsule than competing products and may not be quite as good as one competing product I use, however these capsules are easy to swallow even though they are twice the size of alternative products.Jarrow has a fine reputation for producing quality products.  There really isn't any reason I could give to not use this product.It is debatable if Co-Q10 is cost effective as a supplement, especially for younger people.  The ubiquinol form is the proper from for older adults to consume.  Certainly ubiquinol is a great supplement to take, it's just a bit expensive and thus may only be appropriate for those who can afford it (and are serious about \"anti-aging\") or severe cases (such as individuals with cancer).Good product!
B0013OXABS Sometimes I feel like I need a degree in biochemistry to read Jarrow's product descriptions.  However, I find their definition of Ubiquinol and the description of the difference between ubiquinone and ubiquinol quite enlightening.  The description also does a good job of describing why it is better to take QH (aka ubiquinol-10, CoQ10-H2, QH, \"reduced\" CoQ10) than just \"supermarket shelf Co-Q10\".I took this supplement for one month.  For me, I did not notice any upsurge in energy though I did notice some improvement in the health of my gums, and I did not open the pills, just ingested them.  I did not experience GI upset or any other side effects whatsoever.  I have friends who take high dosage COQ10 supplements and they always report feeling a rush or surge from taking COQ10.  I've never experienced anything like that.  I do believe there are internal and not readily apparent health benefits that come from taking this supplement though, and I intend to make regular supplementation with Ubiquinol a part of my daily health regimen.Jarrow Formulas has rarely let me down with their supplements and I take several of them daily.  I believe this is a good form of Q10 and I think this is a brand that can be trusted.
B0013OXABS This particular dose and potency is more for people over 50 (I'd say even over 65). If you're under 45 you probably shouldn't be taking this dose, period. This is where you get the serious side effects that people complain about.Regardless I am 27 and looking to get back into shape, so I'm taking the lowest dose of 30mg. So far I've experienced the typical benefits of increased stamina during workouts, better coordination and balance as well
B0013OXABS A good product at a very reasonable price... without additives found in similar offerings. With delivery to your door, this makes even more sense.  My &#34;non-medical&#34; opinion is that this product increases my energy.
B0013OXABS Even after reading their page, I had no idea what to expect for this product.  But with that said, I did not notice any difference when taking these.  Do I even NEED \"Ubiquinol\"???  I mean, I take Fish Oil pills and don't notice any difference.  But that I can prove with annual blood tests showing my cholesterol levels.  I have no idea what this stuff is even meant to do!!!
B0013OXABS I have osteoarthritis in my foot and a water cooler discussion at work one day had several people mentioning their use of a product called CoQ10. When this Jarrow Formulas product became available, and the description suggested that it was a similar but better product, I decided to give it a try. I'll admit to being a bit leery about some of the side effects that other users have described. For this reason, I've limited myself to a single dose (one pill) a day. While I haven't suffered any of the stomach problems or other ill-effects other users have described, neither have I seen any discernible difference in my health, energy level, or aches and pains. If anything, I might have lost a little bit of sleep (insomnia is described by WebMD as a potential side effect of CoQ10), but I already have sleep problems, so I wouldn't blame any sleepless nights on this product. In all, this product didn't hurt me at all, but neither did it help, so I won't be continuing its use once this bottle is finished.
B0013OXABS The bottle says 1 softgel = 100mg. But then it also says to take it 1-3x a day! Seriously!?!? It's pushing 30 bucks a bottle, and at 3x a day, this would only last 20 days. Are you kidding? It's no wonder they say Americans have the most expensive urine in the world. Your receptors can only absorb so much; the rest is literally just trickled down the toilet. And even if it is effective, wouldn't you have to commit to using this indefinitely for continued results? That's quite an investment at these prices. And the phraseology touting the benefits of 'Q' vs. 'QH' is very carefully worded and highly speculative. Naturally, the 'Q' which costs 50% less is described as inferior, yet Jarrow makes both. Jarrow Formulas Q-Absorb Co-Q10, 100mg, 120 Softgels. Shouldn't they stick to producing QH exclusively, rather than labelling another version of their own product as inferior? Plus ALL softgels made by Jarrow are REALY SMELLY- eeeew! Supposedly this is a good antioxidant, but at the price, this one is just far too impractical for regular use. I'll use up what I have, but will thibk twice before getting anymore Jarrow softgels. I've got 3 or 4 different softgel supplements here by Jarrow and they all smell real bad. X-p instead of ;oD
B0013OXABS I've used many different brands of Co-Q10 over the past 10-11 years for both heart and gum health (and gum health is intimately tied into heart health as well). I don't currently have any heart problems, but a great many of my close relatives do, and I take this supplement as a preventive measure.Over the years since Co-Q10 first came on the market, the formulations for absorption of Co-Q10 have consistently improved. Before discovering this particular formulation, I had been taking regular Ubiquinol. This new QH-Absorb formulation of Ubiquinol is so named because it absorbs in the body even better than regular Ubiquinol.I have good general energy anyway, because I eat carefully, maintain a normal weight, and exercise regularly. However, I did notice some additional improvement in my energy levels on taking this product, which makes it important not to take it at bedtime.It is recommended to take Co-Q10 with meals, especially with some fat in the meal for better absorption.This product does have soy, but it is gluten free.I am sure other companies with good reputations make this formulation, and I might be willing to use their version, as well. But I have confidence in Jarrow as a company that has an excellent reputation and am happy to continue using this particular version of Ubiquinol in my supplement regime.
B0013OXABS I've been feeling very slow, almost sluggish, recently and my doctor suggested that instead of fueling up on caffeine to get a temporary boost to start drinking more water during the day, eating some small snacks during the day, and taking a few supplements to help fill in the vitamin blanks that I may have.  He suggested to try some QH-Absorb for a little boost of energy, and while it doesn't give me the same level of energy boost that drinking a few cups of coffee does, it certainly makes me feel a little more energetic without the caffeine fall.  It's a more steady boost, so to speak!  I've been taking it for a few weeks now and feel great.  Will update once I finish the bottle and will see if I go back to energy lows when not taking it for a while!  Until then, recommended!
B0013OXABS I switch from CoQ10 to Ubiquinol several years ago when I read studies taht Ubinquinol was more bioavailable. I love the effect of CoQ10, and I thought Ubinquinol was a great upgrade.That is true; the Jarrow's brand of it is excellent. While it's a tad pricey, this is something you don't want to stint on. You want a good name brand maker for a supplement as vitally important as Ubinquinol, part. if you have heart or BP issues.I thoroughly recommend Jarrows. This supplement is one of the few you should NOT be without!
B0013OXABS My husband and I faithfully take this one/day every day.  It is in oil based capsule which is ideal and necessary for proper absorption, especially if you don't take it with a fat-based meal.
B0013OXABS I tend to approve of products from this company, seeing as that I have had good luck with them. This is another that I would recommend. I offer that it has improved my stamina for general activities throughout the day.
B0013OXABS Good deal for Ubiquinol @ 100mg.  Product came as described.  It is my first time taking this product by any manufacturer, so I can not yet make any claims about what it does, or how well it does it.
B0013OXABS It has been know for some time we need to take CoQ10 as we age for heart health. Taking in in the form of Ubiquinol our bodies can utilize it easier. I have been taking this for a few years after having a DNA analysis done to determine what my body needed to be healthier. My highest need came out to be Ubiquinol and it was recommended to be taken in this form.This brand causes no side affects no upset stomach or unpleasant taste. Jarrow is a good brand that I trust for my supplements.
B0013OXABS I've always been quite happy with Jarrow brand supplements but I'm not sure why they put soy in this product. Soy isn't helpful as it interferes with estrogens in the system and it's not recommended if you have hypothyroidism or any form of thyroid disease. Soy is a goitrogen; and in large amounts can mess with the thyroid or create goiters in people who have low thyroid function or low iodine levels. In some instances, soy can restrict the amount of thyroid hormones being absorbed into the system. It's something to seriously consider if you have *thyroid-ism.*  I avoid soy completely, although it's getting quite difficult to find products without it these days. I always read labels for this reason alone; they tend to sneak it into everything and it adds up.Ubiquinol is a great supplement and known for supporting many conditions like high bloodpressure, shortness of breath, heart palpitations, angina pectoris; it also supplies energy and can help reduce the risk of Parkinson's and congestive heart failure. It's fabulous stuff. Other than the soy, I like this product but I hope they'll reconsider the soy in the near future. Anyone listening out there? The capsules go down easy, there's no back up and no indigestion. 100 mgs is a good daily dose and if you're taking it for specific heart trouble or cancer, you're probably taking more than 100 mgs a day. It's also great that this product is offered on the *Subscribe & Save* program which lowers the price and gives us free shipping.
B0013OXABS According to the literature, Ubiquinol QH-Absorb is a more bioavailable and usable way to get Co-Q10, especially if you are around age 50 or above or for some reason cannot synthesis it well from your diet due to certain health conditions.I'm in my early forties and I started taking Co-Q10 recently for heart health and to help lower blood pressure. I noticed it gives me a bit of extra energy as well, and found that to be especially true of this form of the supplement. Research on Co-Q10 is readily available on the internet, so you can do your own research to see if you think it may be valuable for your. Be sure to consult your physician as well. It is turns out to be a supplement you may benefit from taking, then I believe Jarrow's Ubiquinol QH-Absorb is a great choice. The softgel is on the larger side but still easy to swallow. Its list price is high, but the current online price is competitive for this type of supplement.~ Kort
B0013OXABS I followed the directions on the bottle, and noticed no improvement in
B0013OXABS The thing about a lot of supplements is that it's hard to see much effect unless it's specifically for something you're having an issue with. I run and work out a lot and I eat well, so I'm lucky enough to not have any real health issues. I've been taking these for about a month, and while I sure do feel good, I can't honestly say I'm noticing a big difference, aside from a little more mental clarity and perhaps a bit more energy.At almost 40 cents a pop they're not cheap, so if it's energy you want, I'd go for more B12. But if these address your specific health concerns, Jarrow makes quality stuff, so give them a try.
B0013OXABS I only take a few supplements, and CoQ10 is one of them.  It's harder for older folks to metabolize it in its oxidized form (ubiquinone)--the way CoQ10 is typically sold.  A few years ago the Kaneka Corporation perfected a stabilization process offering ubiquinol in its reduced form (already pre-converted and ready for immediate use by the body).  That's good news for older individuals like me.Kaneka is the only company that manufactures ubiquinol, marketed as Kaneka QH (trademark).  They also do not sell directly to consumers.  Instead, its ingredients are sold to companies who manufacture supplements.  Jarrow happens to be one of them.  Currently, there are about 35 different companies that offer Kaneka QH in their CoQ10 brands.  To see the complete list, visit Kaneka's website.Knowing that, it really doesn't matter which brand you buy, as long as the Kaneka QH trademark is listed on the bottle's \"supplement facts.\" I personally like and trust Jarrow products, but I'm sure there are cheaper brands that contain CoQ10 in this form.  Anyone interested in cardiovascular, neurological and liver health (and is 40+) should read up on ubiquinol supplementation.
B0013OXABS As a person ages it becomes more difficult to activate CoQ10, and, in fact, older people often have very low levels of CoQ10. This product makes it easier for your body to absorb Ubiquinol so it can work effectively as an antioxidant and support heart function.I've used Jarrow products in the past and have never been disappointed. I do not take statins (and refuse to), but if you do this product is even more important and crucial to your health because statins further reduce the levels of CoQ10-ubiquinol.
B0013OXABS Works great with my sensitive stomach, no problems, will gladly continue using
B0013OXABS As we age our body levels of CoQ10 diminish. CoQ10 by itself is ubiquinone and our bodies have to convert it to ubiquinol which is the active form that can be used.  This Jarrow Formulas Ubiquinol is a high quality choice, worth the higher price in my opinion.  Note: if you're young (under 25) you should stick to the regular CoQ10 ubiquinone supplements as studies show that you may not absorb the ubiquinol active form as well as older people do.If you are taking statins it is especially important to be supplementing with ubiquinol as statin drugs work to lower your cholesterol in the same pathway your body uses to produce CoQ10, therefore creating a deficiency.Some of the general benefits of CoQ10:--Fires up your body's energy production all the way down to your cells--Increases antioxidant power to help protect you from free-radicals--Helps to strengthen your cardiovascular system--Provides a boost to your immune system
B0013OXABS As an antioxidant I've been using green tea in its natural form and in a pill. I don't notice any effects but am taking it as a preventative. I've read the comments that as we get older our body does not metabolize some of the vitamins and minerals that we need. So I'll alternate the Jarrow with the other supplements to help me absorb the nutrients I need to stay healthy.I'm new to the Jarrow brand and have been impressed by other Amazon users evaluations.
B0013OXABS I've been taking antioxidants in one form or another for the last 30 years with the hope that they actually do what they say. So much of this science around nutrition and supplements is clouded in marketing hype, pseudoscience, and outright lies that I am often skeptical of the claims. I've read about the benefits of CoQ10 and my experience in taking it is that I seem to feel an uptick in energy, but whether the effect is real or imagined is not really clear to me. I understand that Ubiquinol is a form of CoQ10 that is much easier for the body to assimilate, and despite its irritating name, figured I would try it. So far, I cannot really tell any difference, and I suspect long-term doses are required. That's where it becomes a bit tricky unless one can find a reasonably priced supplement, as this one seems to be.These things look like large, black \"horse pills,\" but they are easy enough to take. (I wonder about the Darth Vader black capsules, though, and what gives them that color. The liquid inside is a pale gold.)I tried to find bad press or reviews or Jarrow as a company but could not really run down any. I also could not substantiate where Jarrow makes its products, and as with many other vitamin and supplement makers, I worry if this formulation will continue to be manufactured with quality controls and not devolve to more bad product typical of many of the unregulated supplements rebranded from Chinese factories.I'll keep taking this one for now but will try to learn more about Ubiquinol and Jarrow in order to be informed about what to expect.
B0013OXABS Powerful antioxidant that absorbs well and works well. For energy and stamina. Well priced and well worth. I take it with a multivitamin. Recommended.
B0013OXABS Although I can't really say I have noticed any positive \"effects\" from taking this supplement, I have had no undesirable side-effects either.  I was hoping for an increase in energy level and since I just turned the big 5-5, and I thought this would be a good addition to my daily supplement routine.  I believe my health is better for it, even if I don't feel like taking the stairs two steps at a time as I did when younger. The capsules are large, but still fairly easy to swallow since they are slick.
B0013OXABS I admit I have a bit of a phobia about choking on some large pills, and these big babies scared me.  I learned the pill swallowing trick...tuck chin down a bit instead of putting head back, take a big sip and swallow...and that helped me with this supplement.  Now that I can get them down, I find they do seem to help a bit with both mental alertness and physical energy.  I know that this is a well researched product and as I get older, I try to find products that will keep me in the best condition.  I did not notice any strong taste or upset stomach with these as I've seen others mention, so everyone may react differently to it.  I may do more research and see if I can find a similar product in a smaller pill, otherwise I have no complaints and some benefit from taking this.
B0013OXABS I use this formula of CoQ-10 in tandem with a caffeine supplement (Nutrex Lipo 6 , another Jarrow formula ofMagmindand a diet high in protein.  I exercise at least 60 minutes a day, but regularly up to 2 hours each day.  I find it extremely hard to keep my energy levels up without supplementation due to my active lifestyle and the need to stay alert and peppy due to my profession (I teach math.)  I have definitely noticed an improvement in
B0013OXABS I've used various ubiquinol supplements for years. Jarrow's QH-absorb is carried by my doctor and he's prescribed it to me to improve my energy level and general health. It appears to work quite well, and I tend to feel better when I take it. Like all supplements, it is important for each person to do the research for themselves on their own health conditions and the various causes for them. I have discovered that the great bulk of my own health challenges have come from the food I eat (or don't eat) and environmental toxins and crud added to our veggies, grains, fruit and meats. I try to eliminate all processed foods from my diet and buy the actual whole food that is organic, non-GMO and not messed with by chemical fertilizers, additives and stray genes from our buddies at Monsanto. It seems to be working. I'm 61 and still in good health, active and fairly fit.I highly recommend researching ubiquinol on Wikipedia and Dr. Mercola's site for all it can do for you. There is no guarantee that this formula is what your particular body needs, but I've come to trust Jarrow's range and quality of products. My experience has shown their products in general to be of exceptionally high quality and effectiveness. I recommend this product, especially to those over 40 who may feel themselves slowing down and who need more energy generally.
B0013OXABS There seems to be evidence that QH is a better form of CoQ10 - better absorption, better for people over 45.The problem is, this formula costs about 4x of the equivalent formula of regular CoQ10 by Jarrow.I'm not over 45, but I definitely *am* concerned about getting quality CoQ10 for cardiovascular health & antioxidant health (fights free radicals, which are responsible for most cancers, premature aging, etc).My solution is to alternate between this formula and the regular CoQ10, until there's more evidence, or until I'm over 45. For my older friends & family members who take CoQ10, I'm suggesting they switch to this formula.
B0013OXABS Ubiquinol is recommended for those over 35 or so because it is better absorbed. Jarrow is a good name in nutritional supplements and this a a good product at a reasonable price. I find it gives me more energy and it is essential for anyone taking statins.
B0013OXABS I've reached the age when I need to bump up to Ubiquinol.  The body  produces Co-Q10 - the \"lighter\" version of Ubiquinol.This Jarrow product doesn't contain wheat, gluten, dairy, fish, seafood, peanuts or tree nuts but it contains soy.  That's disappointing for me.I've been taking 100 mg of a different Ubiquinol product.  Jarrow is also 100 mg but usage is 1 - 3 Softgels a day.  I think I'll stick with one.Ubiquinol, is kind of a super version of Co-Q10 - an important part of every cell in our bodies.  Unfortunately, as we get older, we don't have as much so a good supplement is very beneficial.It fights free radicals, strengthens the cardio-vascular system, and generally increases cellular energy.  If your taking a statin drug it's Really beneficial.I believe Jarrow Ubiquiol is a good product that would be great if it didn't have soy.  Soy is the reason I only gave 4 stars.
B0013OXABS Like most book clubs, mine is all women and we spend about half the meeting on social chat.  We're all women of a certain age, and the subject of our chat is often health-oriented.  I was complaining awhile back about my energy level, and one of our members, who is a physician with a women's practice, recommended making sure that vitamin D, magnesium and CoQ10 were among my supplements.I added the CoQ10 (I was already OK on the D and magnesium front) about a month ago (100mg per day) and after a week or so I started to feel an increase in my energy level.  I haven't turned into a powerhouse, but my pedometer tells me that I've increased the pace of my regular long walks and I no longer feel so tired that I'm tempted to cut them short.  I'm also now finally starting the weight training program I've been putting off for the last few months.Is it all down to the Ubiquinol?  All I can tell you is that adding the product is the only thing I changed in my daily regimen and I do feel better.  That's not even close to scientific proof, of course, but it's enough for me to continue with the product.
B0013OXABS I'm not sure how a layperson can wade through all the claims made for Ubiquinol; it purportedly helps so many problems that it threatens to enter the \"snake oil\" category.  Yet, the Wikipedia entry for Ubiquinol contains good information about its chemical properties and the evidence for the many claims you see in the product description above. ALthough not all statements are footnoted, those that do enable you to find the journal, the year, and often whether the study was done with animals or humans (seems to me like an important distinction).On the other hand, we have ubiquinol.com which is 110% behind Ubiquinol (couldn't they have thought of a name that didn't sound like ubiquitous--as in \"panacea\") and offers no cautions, no updated material, and apparently was not proofread.  Such sites do not engender confidence.However, if your health care provider recommends Ubiquinol for one or more disorders, the JARROW FORMULAs brand seems to offer good value, a tightly-sealed container, and a list of active and \"other\" ingredients that include carob aextract and caramel to protect against degradation by light exposure! For those with allergies, the label states that it contains soy, but not nuts, gluten, wheat, dairy, egg, fish/shellfish, or peanuts/treenuts. Jarrow states (again, on the label) that the enhanced stability of their proprietary Ubiquitol formula \"which has been clinically shown to increase Co-Q10 levels up to 777% (6.14 x) over baseline\" at a dose of 300 mg. a day (that would be 3 pills). This is interesting because the label gives the amount of Ubuinol in a single tablet (100mg.) and amount is called the \"serving size.\"  Elsewhere they instruct people to take 1-3 softgels daily \"with a meal or as directed by your qualified health care consultant.\"I'm glad that Jarrow is responsible enough to fully disclose ingredients and, especially, to imply that you might want to consult with you health provider about whether this supplement might help you. Again, good pricing, fast Amazon.com shipping, and disclosure of ingredients (although that dosage thing is a bit confusing--indeed, consult your doctor) lead me to recommend this product for those who need it.
B0013OXABS One of the drawbacks of cholesterol-lowering medications is that they're hard on the liver because they deplete the body's Co-Q 10 (which the liver needs for proper functioning).  While Red Yeast Rice doesn't have as much risk of this, there is still a small risk, even with the supplement.  Because Jarrow Formulas QH-Absorb helps older consumers, who may not activate CoQ10 sufficiently or whose levels may be very low, this helps protect my liver while I'm keeping my cholesterol level at an acceptable level.
B0013OXABS So I am nearing 44.  Yuck.Reading the product description, I should be ok until I am around 45 before my QH levels start to drop.  Woohoo!  What will I do with this year before apparently EVERYTHING stops working?I almost gave this to my mother to try, reveling in my last year of youthful vitality.  I decided to try it myself first.  HOLY COW!  Apparently my QH levels had lowered prematurely?  Whatever the situation, I noticed a marked increase in energy.  Not a &#34;zippy-what-was-in-that?&#34; kind of buzzed way, rather just the feeling of feeling good.  In fact, it took about four days and then about three more before I made the connection about what was making me feel better...not that I felt BAD before.  The odd thing is that I took CoQ10 before...this seems to have a more efficient delivery or better absorption, or something.I am definitely going to continue this, right on through the 44th and 45th birthdays and beyond...I also just ordered a bottle for my mother (guilt)
B0013OXABS Ubiquinol QH is a form of co-enzyme Q10 which has a role in many cellular processes in humans.  It's only been known since the late 1950s and its effects on the body are still being studied today.  The primary source is from animal flesh and to a lesser degree, vegetable oils, so vegetarians especially should consider supplementing their dietary intake.This supplement from Jarrow Formulas seems to be of good quality and the bottle I received has an expiration date of 10/15 which is well over two years from now. It contains 60 softgels each with 100 mg of ubiquinol.
B0013OXABS Jarrow Formulas Ubiquinol QH-Absorb, 100 mg, 60 Softgelsseems to be a high quality supplement.  The key ingredient acts as an antioxidant and as an intermediary in energy production.  It's difficult to know why certain supplements positively impact some people and not others.  It's most measurable benefit is increased energy, which I can say I did experience after just a few doses.These pills are large soft-gels, similar in size to many fish oil and omega-3 capsules I have taken in the past.  Somehow despite the larger size, these were not as difficult to swallow as some other supplements.  They also did not produce any stomach discomfort or gas.The RDA is 1 soft-gel at a time between 1 and 3 times daily, to be taken with a meal.  This product does contain soy, for anybody who need to be cautious regarding their soy consumption.Ubiquinol is the active antioxidant state of Co-Q10, and is reportedly more bio-available than most alternatives.  That makes it easier for the body to absorb, making it more beneficial.CONCLUSIONJarrow generally produces quality products.  These pills are large enough to make me reluctant to take more than one.  The potential positive heath impacts can vary a lot depending on the person, but I have noticed increased energy when taking this supplement.Enjoy.
B0013OXABS Coenzyme Q10 is often used to aid in heart health.  I was doing research on the topic about 5 years ago and came across CoQ10.  I liked the fact that pretty much the only side effect was trouble sleeping if taken late in the day --- I definitely don't consider that a side effect WHEN taking the pill early in the day.  Over the years I shifted away from taking CoQ10, until I was reminded of it recently.  Ubiquinol is one of the most readily absorbed forms, so that is the only type that I will take.  I'm unsure just how much it has helped with my heart (haven't really taken it by itself with no other supplement or dietary changes to be able to know 100%), but I do like the slight boost in energy it gives me throughout the work day.  It's not like an \"energy buzz\" or anything, but my mind seems slightly clearer.
B0013OXABS I am 43, I look 24. I've been taking supplements like this (not just plain multi-vitamins) since I was in my early 20's. I know the proof is in the effectiveness over time and Jarrow is a brand I trust because they really try to put a good product out there with excellent quality assurance. For that, you will pay a little extra and it's well worth it. I recently changed doctors and when he was asking basic questions he got to age and rolled his eyes and said, \"c'mon now\".. I had to show him my license. He looked stunned then asked me what I do. I basically eat little sugar, work hard, eat my veggies and protein, and take supplements... take supplements.. take supplements and try to stick with natural foods as much as possible. I have yet to have a wrinkle, even the tiniest one under my eyes or anywhere else and feel better now than I did in my 20's. I cannot attribute that to Jarrow, but can attribute that to genetics and taking quality supplements like this one.
B0013OXABS Ok, the latest research says that this form of coQ10 is the best for older adults as absorption tends to be a problem with other forms of it. I still choose to take this supplement (Ubiquinol QH-Absorb) WITH food that contains some fat in it to assure the optimum absorption possible (this stuff is not cheap,& I want my money's worth!)Coq10 is found in the mitochondria of every cell in your body, primarily concentrated in your muscle tissue like your heart (& gums) tissue while it is hard to measure a deficiency of it without a blood test, I was told that if you have gum issues (like receding , bleeding gums, & no signs of an actual gum disease as the cause, it would indicate low CoQ10) This is a \"window\" of how your heart tissue is doing. Well I have receding gums & I brush & floss & have no gum disease so I figured being 55 years old it couldn't hurt to be proactive & supplement! I have been taking this for about 2 months & I don't see the receding getting any better (maybe once it recedes that's it?) at least it isn't getting any worse.I don't have a problem with the time of day I take it (it doesn't keep me up at night) I think maybe the people that are severely deficient will actually be able to feel the difference as my friend said when he took it with dinner, he felt his heart beating (strongly) all night long (he has heart disease) but when he took it with breakfast he had no problems sleeping.The softgel/pills are on the larger size if that is an issue for you you have been forewarned! I personally had no problem but most softgels don't bother me, no burping, queasiness etc. All in all if you are older and want to stay at your \"peak\" health, this is a wise investment to do so.
B0013OXABS The Jarrow softgels are about the size of a 3 large peas end-to-end and easy to swallow. Unfortunately, they did not have a major effect on my energy levels. While there are many claims to the health benefits, I have not had any changes in my cholesterol, or other blood values while taking these.....and I get blood tests fairly often. The nice thing is, unlike many other vitamins, there is no bad taste/smell. I don't know if supplements make a difference or not, but I take them. I don't think they hurt, and after being diagnosed with stage 4 cancer a year and a half ago, I am doing everything possible to stack the deck in my favor, and lead a healthier life. I eat much better than I used to, but I also take supplements. I am still trying to find the right \"blend\" and I don't know that I will incorporate these into my regimen.
B0013OXABS As I say on all these supplements I can only hope they do anything like they claim.  I guess they have as much a mental boost as anything but it appears to be a quality product.
B0013OXABS Ubiquinol has been recommended by my naturopath as part of my health regime.  Although I can't say for sure it works, I feel that this product is one I can depend on great quality.
B0013OXABS My quick research showed nothing to fear if you take this product, unless you are worried about high levels of triglycerides, so it seems like a good product, considering the brand, price, and dosage.  Seems like a logical addition to your daily vitamin intake.
B0013OXABS Energy is something sorely lacking at age 79 and I have difficulty staying awake while reading or watching a movie.  Also, basic housecleaning has become an impossible chore.  However, my current use of these gel capsules and also methylcobalamin lozenges have performed marvels in giving me more energy.  Extreme drowsiness still comes and goes, but not nearly as often and life is again more enjoyable.  These are expensive on my social security income, but worth continuing.
B000CD1R7K The other reviews for this foot rest called it sturdy and well built. They were right. It can be adjusted to a number of different heights to suit your particular needs - and based on the design of the stand it will stay where it's put. One of the best parts is that while it is stable enough to be the main foot rest where I play my guitar it can be collapsed flat and it easily fits into a bag or backpack - probably around half of the thickness of a chord book, although heavier, as it is steel with a rubber tread on top. It feels like I will own this for a long time - a well priced, good value.Edit2/2013After owning this for around a year and using it every day I find that it still looks and works like new. I recommend it highly."
B000CD1R7K This thing is useless. Good idea, but way too light/rickety to be useful. Unless you're constantly aware of it, 99% of the time you'll end up just kicking it over when you go to put your foot on it. Pass on this."
B000CD1R7K This is quality construction.  It's definitely a must.  I'm a taller guy and it's important to have proper posture for longer playing periods.  I'm glad I bought this."
B000CD1R7K I've owned several poor quality foot rests in the past and needed a new one.  This one exceeded my expectations and for the price is an excellent value.I'm 6'2 and weigh 225.  There are numerous adjustment angles that I can switch to and be comfortable and I'm not concerned about the legs bending.  The photo makes them look weaker than they are."
B000CD1R84 I purchased this rack last year to hold my outboard recording gear.  I liked the fact that it was open in the back so I could patch things in and out easily before I bought a patch bay.  I find it very sturdy and well made, and I've loaded it almost completely full.  I do recommend placing the heavier units towards the bottom."
B000CD1R84 great rack.  small enought to fit on top of a table or under it.  light weight but holds a lot.  at some point I had 2 behringer amps, power conditioner and 2 single unit audio processors."
B000CD1R84 First off, most audio racks have that annoying &#34;slide these little metal pieces over the rails and put your screws into them&#34; instead of properly sized holes. Not this one. Not only do the holes get made proper size with threads in them, but it even includes 48 screws so you don't have to try to figure out which of the 3 sizes you've collected over the years is going to fit.I loaded it up with equipment and haven't had a worry about it since. Solid construction and the mounting just works. This one is done right."
B000CD1R84 Simple and useful rack stand. Easy to assemble. Easy to mount rack components... but the rubber leg terminals are easy to lose too. A little more interest in the manufacture means more quality."
B000CD1R84 This is exactly the item I needed for my podcasting rig.  It holds my Behringer mixer along with my compressor and my vocal processing box.  It lets me move the whole thing easily out of the way when I need to use my table for something besides podcasting.The stand is easy to assemble and is very well built.  There's nothing bad I can say about it, if you need to hold some audio gear then have no reservations about picking one of these up.  Highly recommended."
B000CD1R84 This stand is great for my 45lb Peavey 1500. It is a light weight rack and I had to put the amp toward the bottom. I wouldn't put much more in it but it is exactly what I needed. I can grab the rack by the top bracket and move it around easily. Haven't tried gigging with it but if you are gentle I think it would work fine."
B000CD1R84 This rack stand is made up of a heavy steel, and welded together very well. I received my rack stand yesterday, and put it together in under 5 minutes. My audio equipment mounted easily, with the 48 INCLUDED mounting screws, and everything looks great, and I don't have to worry about this thing collapsing or falling over. It is very sturdy, and very stable. I recommend this to anyone planning to rack up to 12 audio or networking devices. I will definitely be purchasing another rack stand once I fill this one up. I will add pictures of my rack stand setup shortly."
B000CD1R84 I've had it for about a month now and it hasn't fallen apart so I guess that's a plus, but the main issue with this rackmount is that whatever automated machine they used to drill the screw holes is definitely defective, as a large majority of the holes are slightly deformed and will not take in the provided screws and are therefore USELESS.  Thanks to this problem I am only able to use TWO slots out of TWELVE.  It's definitely very frustrating and although the price is tempting, stay away from this."
B000CD1R84 it ok, its hard to use the bottom 1u space because of the angle, the gear must be very short to fit the bottom space before hitting your mounting surface....11u rack, not 12u...."
B000CD1R84 I use this with my mobile DJ equipment and it is fantastic. Very sturdy and light enough to easily carry. Holes for screw mounts are perfectly placed and allow easy component installation. Plastic covers on the feet came off right away though, but not really a big deal to me."
B000CD1R84 I've uploaded customer-supplied images above to show just how much gear one of these is capable of holding and how small the stage or studio footprint is. When you factor in the price it's plain to see that this rack is not only a bargain, but a flexible platform for mounting components.One other characteristic that the images reveals is this is not a table-top only rack. They work very well on the floor.The rack itself is easy to assemble and is built like a tank. I have a bass amp head and a power amp, plus a power conditioner in one of my racks that, combined, weighs around 50 pounds. The rack is not stressed or strained by this weight, and could probably hold another 50 pounds safely and reliably. Another plus is it comes with a bag of high quality mounting screws for components, eliminating that expense (I was expecting to have to orderRaxxess Rack Screws With Washers Hardware (Pack of 25), which turned out to be completely unnecessary.)My only complaint is the rubber feet caps easily fall off, but a little glue rectified that rather trivial problem.If you need portability, reliability and value for smaller gear suites that are frequently moved (such as setting up on stages) this is an ideal solution for rack mounted equipment. I am so pleased with mine that I intend to purchase another one, bringing the total to three."
B000CD1R84 I purchased this to help unclutter my desk with some of my recording gear. This stand is very stable and useful! So if you want a cheap way to rack your stuff this is the way to go!"
B000CD3QY2 The ability to quickly change the range and sensitivity has made it easy to dial in the exact sound you want to hear. It's built like a tank and has worked flawlessly in the time I've had it. Since I normally power it with a wall wart, I don't have much of an opinion about battery life.Bottom Line: It costs a bit more than the standard Dunlop wah pedals, it's worth it."
B000CD3QY2 Sure it's a few bucks more than the standard Crybaby, but totally worth it. Built like a tank, but make sure to apply a little bit of white lithium grease to the gear pieces once a year or so to keep things smooth and reduce wear on the inner workings."
B000CD3QY2 for 99 dollars , quit looking at other wah pedals....this one does it all......its so versatile....sounds very authenic 60's too,.....good pedal movement....endless variations in sound avaialable.....it gets a great sound right out of the box ..dig it man,,!!"
B000CD3QY2 Your option to change the wah configuration is amazing. Only problem is the no DC adapter included, needs buy separately."
B000CD3QY2 Lunar lander here we come, This pedal will take your playing to the moon. It's easy to use, I recommend getting the 9v AC adapter to save on batteries and avoid the battery hassle. Use the Crybaby with other effect pedals, the uses are endless and fun. I was playing some 'Born On The Bayou' Creedence guitar the other day and wow, It will build your music muscle power to try and keep up with where this pedal wants to send you. A keeper, not like pedals that have no lasting power, this pedal has so much to offer over such a wide range of playing styles. It's right up there with my top five effects pedals of all time. I'm sure I'll be using the Crybaby for the rest of my music life."
B000CD3QY2 Wow!  This is the pedal to own.  There are a lot of good pedals out there, but this one has that original, bright wah tone and a range of features and tonal settings that can take you from 70's quack to surf warble to rock tone sweeps. Just amazing! If you don't have to have a specific dunlop signature pedal, this will get you through most of the tonal range you could imagine. A great purchase and built like a tank."
B000CD3QY2 For years I played the original Cry baby, the Vox Wah, and others I can't remember names of. I was always on a quest for a good wah sound that I just couldn't find. I didn't want to spend $600 on a wah with a rack. So at the recomendation of a studio engineer I purchased this wah about 5 years ago. I am very pleased that I followed that advice because this pedal really has the range of wah I was looking for. The greatest thing about this pedal is that it is customizable. The user dials in the frequency sweep they want. The volume boost is a great feature when you need to play a lead over the live mix. I recomend this wah pedal over all the others, especially the signature series wahs because you can get the same sound out of this unit with a little tweeking."
B000CD3QY2 This is the wah I was looking for.  Very versatile and built in boost feature is great too. buy it...you wont regret it."
B000CD3QY2 First of all, I love the Crybaby 535Q and I recommend this wah pedal. I will tell you my wah pedal story.Several years ago, I bought a Crybaby GCB-95 and, even though I did not use wah very much at the time, I think it was in the shop twice to get repaired within a year. Fortunately, it never gave out on me during a gig, but it was only a matter of time. Finally, I gave up and just stopped using wah pedals completely.A couple years ago, I bought a Digitech XP-100 whammy wah, mainly for the whammy effects to learn how to do Morello's style. Since it has some digital wah patches was available, I started to use them too and was happy because it doesn't have a treadle that will break like on my GCB-95. The wahs were usable, but just did not sound as good.Finally I was supposed to play Alice in Chains, \"Man in the Box\" and the Digitech was just not going to cut it. So, it was time to get a real wah. I searched around on YouTube for demos and talked to people to see what they used. I chose the 535Q because people told me that they've never had a maintenance problem with them, and it is very versatile.You can get several kinds of wah sounds by tweaking the dials,and they have some great suggestions in the manual to get started. I set mine on the Cantrell setting and have left it there because I mainly use the wah when playing early alternative 90s hard rock styles. That setting works will in songs like RATM, \"Bulls on Parade\" as well, including to create the white noise for scratch DJ sounds.I still do not use wah pedals terribly often, but it is nice to have a reliable wah that can do whatever I need it to by simply adjusting a couple knobs. I think that as long as I need a wah pedal, this one will suit my needs in many styles, and I think it will remain on my pedalboard for years! It is definitely one to consider, and the price is not that bad."
B000CDT4VQ Bought for project Telecaster. Delivered promptly and in excellent shape. Case fits well and is finished nice, Hard to find better case at this low price!."
B000CDT4VQ I know most budget guitars don't come with cases, most not even a gig bag anymore. That's the trade-off I guess in the internet age in order to keep costs down. Even my Fender Standard Telecaster came sans-case and I had to coax the salesperson to throw in a gig-bag as an incentive but even that was back in the day. I had not looked at guitar gear in so long that I didn't think about guitar cases until I got the itch to get a new six-string and came across these. They look great, seem well built(I am not a professional touring musician) and apparently do the job.The exterior is covered in black tolex, just like a pricey case, and the gold stitching and plush interior really make this case seem worth much more than the asking price. The storage compartment is adequately sized and there's a simple lock that would only be functional as a safety measure to ensure it stays latched. There are brass feet on the bottom and along the edge to keep it level and prevent damage to the case. It fits both my MiM Tele andSquier by Fender Deluxe Stratocaster Maple Neck, Pearl White Metallicperfectly and I suspect it will do a fine job protecting them.I will be picking up a tweed version for the Telecaster to match up with the style, and my lovely Fender amp. Like I stated, there's no longer any excuse for not having a good guitar case."
B000CDT4VQ This is better than a gig bag, for sure, and looks like it could hold pretty much any standard sized solid body electric. Now, it's not padded really well and doesn't look like it'll hold up for more than a few years, but it was cheap. It seems to be slightly off kilter at the hinges and requires some fidgeting to get the lid closed properly, which is why I drop a star."
B000CDT4VQ I bought to use for my squire strat. It also fit my tele to. A real good quality case to protect your axe from damage when carrying from gig to gig."
B000CDT4VQ This is an inexpensive but for the money, well built case. I don't have any complaints. My Fender Strat fits snugly in the lined case and while it isn't the most durable case (I wouldn't use it to ship my guitar) it is strong enough for hauling your guitar from one place to the next."
B000CDT4VQ I've bought three of these now - this is an awesome, well made case that fits just about any superstrat guitar easily. The most recent was for something rather unique (a fanned fret, compound scale eight string) and that guitar also fit perfectly with plenty of room to spare.There are more expensive options out there, but for a non-fitted \"do it all\" case, this is the best bang for your buck hands down. I am comfortable using it to carry any of my guitars, from the inexpensive ones to the high end customs. Great case, great price."
B000CHJTG2 The Pyle \"Battery Powered PA System With Wireless Microphone\" is surprisingly well made and has features I would have expected on much more expensive equipment. We run workshops, often at our customer's locations, and needed a portable PA system that could easily be transported and doesn't require a lot of power. Here are my observations:+ Long Battery Life - Worked for over 4 hours straight, but can be connected to AC to work as well+ Wireless Microphone - Built into the system, has good range, and acceptable sound. Battery included.+ Inputs for 2 Microphones, 1 Guitar, and 1 Audio Connection - Each with it's own volume control+ Portable - Built in retractable handles and wheels makes moving this around very easy+ Includes a mini-Plug to 1/4\" Converter - A handy accessory+ Includes Echo Effect - A fun adjustable effect to liven up your voice (my kids loved playing with this :-)Note: My unit shipped with one of the fuses in a bag and it needed to be installed before the system would work.This unit worked much better than expected and is a great value for the performance of this small sized unit!Highly Recommended!"
B000CHJTG2 It works and is very versatile and puts out great sound and power.  the portable feature is great also. Just what i wanted"
B000CHJTG2 It's really not a 200w system.  The booklet even says it is only 100 watts, and I doubt it is really even that powerful.  The wireless microphone only works when you put your mouth about an inch from it.  My Shure XLR wired microphones do not work with it even with an adapter plug.  The instrument input works OK with my Taylor guitar, but it's not 100 watts loud.  I guess it's OK as a portable guitar amp in a small venue without any vocals."
B000CHJTG2 .I'm a guitar player and singer who works with a band and as a solo and as a duo with a bass player. I found one of these used for half the retail price. It had no microphone but I already have mics and I don't like wireless anyway and don't need one. Besides, who could pass up the bargain as long as the unit works.Well, it was great. I brought a small Behringer guitar amp in case I had to choose between guitar and vocals in terms of sound quality since the unit has onle one set of tone controls. BIG surprise; my Martin GPA sounded great through the PWMA-230 and so did my vocals. I didn't need anything else for a duo gig in a large and semi-loud bar. Volume was strong, the sound was clear and full and the guitar and voice sounded as natural as could be. It's light as a feather (I have troubles with my knees and use a cane and it was no problem) and it sounds great. And since I play there once a week I left it at the gig and do not worry about theft or breakage since the unit is so inexpensive and replaceable even at the marketplace price. I might give it 4 1/2 stars but I can't figure out how to get half-stars. This is a godsend to one and two person acts who already have enough to carry. With my ZT Club amp for my Telecaster for band gigs and the PWMA-230 for acoustic gigs I have more room, less to carry and less to worry about.Update Oct. 25th:I think others have mentioned problems with Pyle-Pro Audio's customer service. I must say that my experience with them has been unsatisfactory too. I wrote to them praising their product and asked if for specs on the power cord and whether they sold an extra in case I lost the one that came with the unit and if they also sold a cover for it. I wrote a least three times and got no response so far. The website was no help and calling them directly was worse; got the wrong dept., was transferred to a dept. which never picked up the phone. I still love the PWMA230 but I am no fan of its manufacturer.Update Oct. 28To be fair, someone did finally contact me today. My questions were unanswered and I don't think my e-mail was read very carefully but at least they did respond. I'll update as to the answers and information provided."
B000CHJTG2 This system works just okay.  Try to turn it up and you get bad feedback.My microphone stopped working shortly after I purchased this item.  I contacted Pyle to see about a replacement and got nothing but runaround from them.They couldn't give me a price for repair or to purchase a new one, or where I could even buy a replacement.Very frustrating!"
B000CZ0RHY I only use this as a tube amp for vocal.  For the price, I can drive 2 mics, and fit it in a 1U space.  The tube sound is good enough for live performance for as long as I don't crank it up too much, it also helps with the gain of the SM58 as it's much lower than my other Line6 mic.  I used to have multiple  Studio Projects VTB-1s and ART Tube Pacs but their tubes seem to have died due to old age, and I mainly cared for the tube feature in them, so stepping down to the MIC2200 is fine with me.If you want to get warmer vocal sound, and don't want to invest too much for it, the MIC2200 is the way to go, imo.  However, buying Behringer products always require crossing fingers (and hope that they last).  So I'll update should I encounter problems."
B000CZ0RHY This is a wonderful product for the price! Ive used other tube preamps that cause terrible humming at low input gain. A little difficult to set up properly, but if you are running an eq separate, then you only have to adjust the input and output. I dont care much for the tube display with led lights behind it, but it doesn't bother me either. Behringer makes great products at incomparable prices."
B000CZ0RHY I use this as a microphone preamp with an AKG Perception 220 microphone. There are 2 ins and 2 outs, 1 balanced/1 unbalanced on each channel. I am not an expert on studio equipment so this review is from a personal position. I run this direct to my digital recorder. I get a good clean sound on my vocals. Still to early to give reliabilty and flexability of this unit. The unit is 2 channels, has rack mounts and is sturdy, not sure on the tube yet. New to the Behringer product line, but so far I like it and will explore its potential. 5 stars for price, quality, features, amazon."
B000CZ0RHY I like this preamp. I use one channel for microphone and the other for an electric guitar with good results.Is very sadly and spendthrift that its useful life will be the duration of its tube, another concept of producci&oacute;n nothing considered with consumer and planet."
B000CZ0RHY Don't like that it's difficult to change the tube.  Sound quality was not what I expected, maybe because I wasn't familiar with the settings.  No power cord was included in mine or manual.  Manual should have been include not sure about the cord.  Dials are very small.  My MIC200 and MIC800 are much better than this.  I can't say it's bad.  Just that there are better choices in my opinion."
B000CZ0RHY I operate an alternative broadcast studio, we create music related content and broadcast it on the internet. We needed some stand-alone microphone preamps and after searching the internet I decided to give this Behringer unit a try.This single rack space unit provides two independent microphone preamps, each of which is equipped with a single band of sweepable parametric equalization to adjust the timbre of the final output. Before I even tried the piece as a preamp I opened it up to look inside.DO NOT EXPECT TO CHANGE THE TUBEThe tube is mounted in such a way that it is probably impossible to change it out for a different one.Fortunately the preamps sound good with the stock tube. There is no schematic provided so it's really impossible to say how the tube is implemented in the circuit and how much it actually contributes to the tone of the unit.HOW DOES IT SOUNDThe preamps sound very good, full, rich, crisp highs, deep lows, it's a function of the microphone you connect to it as far as I can tell. For comparison I A-B compared this preamp to our very expensive API 3124+ preamp which is a 4-channel unit that we paid over $500 per preamp-channel for, that is 10-times the price per channel of this Behringer unit. I'm not going to say the Behringer beat the API but they were a dead heat in most listening tests. My female partner who is not too technical (but has great ears) thought the Behringer was just as good as the API. We also have a Grace m801 which is another over-$500/channel preamp, she definitely liked the Behringer sound better than the Grace (personally I think it was the EQ on the Behringer that affected her choice when comparing to the Grace).If my API or Grace preamps go toast I will definitely have them repaired. If the Behringer dies, it's going in the trash and I'll buy another one. It's simple economics and at $100 for two preamps that sound as good as they do these are really nice. They sound good. They have an industry standard packaging. The input and output connectors are excellent. It even has a line input mode so you can add a little tube distortion to a line-level signal (I have not tried this because we don't need it).We broadcast between three and ten, live one-hour shows per week using this preamp for vocals. NOBODY in our listening audience has ever complained and none of them know we switched from our high-end pieces to this very inexpensive preamp. Now our expensive preamps are back over in our production studio and are used for recording tracks that play behind our live performances during the shows.RELIABILITYWe have not had any problems with this unit. It is warmed up for an hour before each broadcast, I've never heard any noise or bad stuff come from it. We have A LOT of Behringer gear in our studio, it lives right along side gear from Neve, API, Allen and Heath, UA, Meyer, Lexicon and Apogee. Out of 103 pieces of Behringer equipment I've bought we've had two pieces that had problems and those occurred right out to the box. I had much worse reliability with Crown amplifiers than Behringer products and I really like Crown amps, regardless of the problems, they just sound so good. In my experience the Behringer products have provided professional results for an amazing low price. That's a win-win in my book."
B000CZ0RLK This is not a top tier condenser mic, but it is well worth the 40 dollar price tag. It has 2 different pattern modes as well as a gain boost switch. The carrying case is also nice.Do not expect this to be MXL or even Behringer B-1 quality, but it's still better than no condenser, and is perfect for doing room acoustics or live mic'ing."
B000CZ0RLK I tested in my friend recording studio and work really good trust me for the price it over the top"
B000CZ0RLK Seems to work well.  Like the other reviewers said, you could probably pay 150 more and get the same thing.  solid construction.  getting used to the attachment.  It will never stand in the position like in the photo.  There's no resistance on that joint so it flops down.  Just place it upside down.  Record using a headset or you'll get too much feedback.  Just ordered a shorter stand.  Hope that it works with that joint that makes it stand head down."
B000CZ0RLK No complaints at all. I use this for vocals and recording acoustic through a Pod Studio UX2. Have had tons of compliments on the sound. People can't belive its a 50 dollar mic when I tell them. Such a fantastic price on this, can't beat it."
B000CZ0RLK I'm just getting into miking and recording music, mainly to get my son off to a good start. I'm kind of feeling my way. When I wasn't getting a good result from a dynamic mic, a friend suggested a pre-amp and/or a condenser mike. I ended up getting both (the AMP tube pre-amp) and running this through the AMP into my Tascam DP-008. WOW! I have to work on getting the levels matched properly, but this thing is just SO much cleaner than the dynamic mics when used on an acoustic guitar. Our music sessions have slowed down a bit (he just turned 16, so hanging with the Old Man is the LAST thing on his mind, LOL), but this is a quality piece of equipment that seems durable. Includes a nice hard plastic carry-case, too. For this kind of money, you can't really go wrong."
B000CZ0RLK For the money, this mic performs very well. It is very sensitive, I can hear my computer fans in the background with this mic. If you are going to use it for recording make sure you have a quiet room. I also put a pop filter on it. I've only had it a day, so I'll see how it does in the long run."
B000CZ0RLK this is my first real recording microphone. I really like it.  I use it to record vocal with my home studio setup and it does a good job"
B000CZ0RLK After reading all of the reviews here and around the Internet, I took a chance since this is my first professional-level microphone. I'm glad I did because it's really great.One thing you will need, though, is a phantom power unit. I wish I could remember which one I got here on Amazon (I think it was about $25-$35) but it worked great. Excellent sound quality, much better than any other mic I've used."
B000CZ0RLK [Later: The mic is indeed the Behringer C-1, but Amazon has provided it with the description belonging to the C-1U.  Unlike Amazon's description, this is not a mic that comes with USB plug, phantom power, and computer connectivity. And, of course, none of the advertised \"included\" computer software programs is included.  It's a conventional studio mic that requires connection to a regular amp / P.A. with an XLR jack and phantom power. It will NOT connect to the USB port of a computer without an expensive adapter and a preamp with phantom power.  Moreover, Amazon's form thus far is denying a refund and offering only replacement--presumably for another mic just like this one! If you want the described mic, Amazon is showing it from a different vendor--at about 30 more plus S&H.;]The Behringer C-1 mic is the best condenser mic I've used for the money, its large diaphragm capable of reproducing some of the rich and deep sonorities of the costly, high-end mics at the radio station (NPR) where I occasionally work.  However, Behringer makes a distinction between the C-1 and the C-1U.  The description on Amazon fits the C-1U, not the C-1.  So one way or another, 50% of the purchasers of this product are likely to be surprised and disappointed.Indeed, the C-1U is a phantom-powered mic that doesn't require phantom power, which it derives from the USB port of a computer.  Moreover, the mic not only saves its owner the bother of a pre-amp with phantom power but it also makes unnecessary a costly (and time-consuming) XLR to USB adapter.  It's ready to go--just plug it into your laptop and start recording.  (I use Sound Studio, but the included free software--Audacity--works practically as well.)On the other hand, if the mic is a C-1 as advertised, be prepared to receive a conventional condenser mic, with an XLR connector and a phantom power requirement (found on numerous recording devices and P.A. amps or available on a neat little pre-amp sold by Amazon, the A.R.T.).Having just returned a keyboard--the M-Audio Pro88sx--for which Amazon mistakenly provided the wrong description (for the M-Audio Pro88, not the Pro88sx), I'd be hesitant to place any bets on which mic the buyer will receive--the C-1 as advertised, or the C-1U as described.  At least if you're purchasing directly from Amazon instead of a sub-vendor, you can be assured of a hassle-free return.  And if the mistake is due to Amazon's description, returns are generally postage-free."
B000CZ0RLK This microphone deserves the positive reviews it has received. It is very well made equipment, which is readily apparent to a total sound equipment novice like myself. The item as pictured looks different from what I received; it is not the all lighter gray plastic looking body base, it's more of champagne color and is metal and the screw on adapter on the bottom is black (heavy duty plastic). Not sure why the picture is showing that is, because the actual microphone I received is much more impressive looking.I was initially looking to spend ~$125 on a simple home recording setup using my iMac. I ultimately spent about $135 because I moved to a Behringer mixer board that can convey the appropriate power to a condenser mic like this one.For those who are starting out with recording, I recommend this microphone and a quality XLR cord and you will not be disappointed with your results."
B000CZ0RLU Do not expect a studio quality out put from this unit. That said, for the price it is an excellent product. Obviously, if you are looking for a studio quality mic you would not be here. This product does what it supposed to do and exceeds your expectations. For a normal use this is quite good. Feels little tiny but excellent gain. I would buy it again if required."
B000CZ0RLU I can't believe I'm giving a 5 star review to a Behringer product, but they got these right... I replaced a way-more expensive Audix condenser mic with these, and they actually sound pretty darned good. If I crunch one or if one breaks, I'll just get more at this price. I have other Behringer mics laying around, and they all kinda suck. These are totally fine."
B000CZ0RLU These come with a stereo holding bar and adapter for mic stand.  They do need 48 V phanom power from your board or a mic amp.  I'm using a mic amp and these are the input to a paging system which I will review in more detail later.  The 48VDC comes from the mic processor then cancels feedback and sends the paging audio to my amplifier which I will review as a set.If you do stereo recording, you can't go wrong with these - their self noise level is so low it is below that of a human ear.  It sounds great, and setup outside with 140 dB of gain it really performs well hearing birds chirp from far away, rain drops comming down, and sounds you never would hear.Note:  NEVER get these wet - you must have a cover over them for outdoor use in the rain.You will need 2 XLR cables for full stereo recording with the transfer bar, but you already know that."
B000CZ0RLU I use this pair of mics mostly to record a piano in XY configurationPros:-Price point-Sturdy, good construction-Included accessories (carrying case, clips, stereo bar)Cons:-Have to adjust the gain just right on a mixer preamp to avoid noise"
B000CZ0RLU These are condenser mics so you will need phantom power to make them work. I'm using them in our drum room, one is on hi-hat and one is on a small cymbal. They have a smooth un-hyped sound.The mics also come with a nice little plastic mounting bar so you can mount them in a stereo pair right out of the box. I have used them in an X-Y overhead position and they sounded quite good and very natural.Some of the other microphones in my kit cost upwards of $1200 each so I am aware of what &#34;expensive&#34; microphones sound like, these perform &#34;up there&#34; with the expensive mice while being bargain priced.Good music to all."
B000E0PPG0 2 15&#34; speakers each with a horn built into the cabinet. These hold up great year round. I will more than likely take the speakers down to make sure they don't fall onto my baby grand..."
B000E0PPG0 no problem...it came today like the computer said it would... the box was mint...to my surprise there wasn't even any tape on it... I opened it ... pulled it from its plastic sleeve and set it up on about a minute it was holding a speaker cab...thanks again Amazon....and why would I shop any where else?"
B000E0PPG0 It is lighter than most, fast and easy to set up and not bulky while strong and sturdy enough to support heavy 15&#34; speakers.The material and paint quality is not the greatest but the price is good and it will last long enough to worth the money especially for me gigging 4-6 times a week."
B000E0PPG0 I only needed one, I haven't use it, but I'm sure it's going to work well. This is going to be use for a piano amp which will help with the sound of the amp when put on top.ffsalsa"
B000E0PPG0 Okay here we go again what can be said about this roduct except that it works and does what it us supposed to"
B000E0PPG0 It's a cheap speaker stand. Heavier, in terms of weight, than I thought it would be. Cheaply made, the safety pin is kind of a joke. Overall though, it'll do the job. I would not use this at the highest height setting, but one or two notches lower, else it starts leaning."
B000E0PPG0 the knobs seem very easy to over tighten, I haven't done it yet but I'm planning on treating this stand with the utmost care so as not to have any surprises when I put my expensive PA speaker on it"
B000E0PPG0 If you have really large or heavy speakers, you might want to consider professional grade stands, but these will work fine for any speakers under 35 lbs. or so (maybe more, if you keep them lower down).  They look nice, and are easily worth their selling price.They do not include any additional hardware for mounting the speakers, so you'll have to figure out what you need, and buy those things separately."
B000E0PPG0 I own a mobile DJ company and have 4 ultimate TS-90 stands and i'm really not happy with them.  This product is simple does the job and is well priced.  They are a little heavy at 9 lbs per stand but i like the look and operation of them.  I've been happy with them so far."
B000EE8YPK theres the snark for clipons, the blackout or boss tu-2 for pedals, or a rack option. my pre-amp unit has a tuner but i love these for tuning off stage or something. got at least 3 of these around, i can use this for bass or guitar (i tune to low drop f and it even picks it up on bass)"
B000EE8YPK The tuner is great  -  seems very accurate and senses all the notes with ease. my only complaint is the little kickstand on the back, doesn't hold it at an angle that i find very usable.  otherwise? a fine product that i expect to last for years. korg makes great tuners. i also have a pitchblack and a pitchblack plus. if any of the three of them were to ever be lost or stolen, i'd replace them in a heartbeat with exactly the same models."
B000EE8YPK I don't use the other features, but as a tuner, this product is spot on.  Filters out noise well when using the mic.  Only two things to gripe with - 1.  The leg that you can use to prop this up isn't very usable. and 2. It's not great for gig use as the screen isn't that readable.As a home tuner or for a brightly-lit gig - excellent!"
B000EE8YPK Works well.  It can detect tones from the electric input or acoustically.  I find myself using it a lot.  Even as I learn the notes on the guitar fret-board.  If I guess incorrectly it reminds me of the note.  I also use it to intonate my guitar.  It has some other advanced features, but I haven't need them.  Display is nice and large even though I still need my reading glasses to see the note."
B000EE8YPK It is always a delight nowadays when any electronic device is still functional after such a long time.  From 2006 when I bought it, till 2013 when I write this, still going strong, very happy with my purchase.  Alas, my experience says newer devices being sold are rarely as good as when they first come out, but you never know, it may still be as good as ever now.For what it's worth, I am a professional musician with perfect pitch."
B000EE8YPK I have had this tuner for about half a year and frankly, I have had enough.The main problem with this tuner is the usability.The tuner has a poor display, is extremely finicky and it does not display the octave of the key.Tuning with it can be condensed into one word - frustrating.The needle is very finicky and jumps all over when ever I pick the strings, especially so when the guitar is much out of tune.The poor display is dark, with no build-in light, and has poor visibility at angles too. Combine all that you have a terrible, accurate tuner.Yes, it is accurate but only as accurate as what the graph can display, which is +/-2 cents.Enough said, I bought a new tuner, the Seiko SAT800, for a bit more money that this.The main differences between SAT800 and the CA-40:SAT800 has a build-in light, CA-40 does not.CA-40 has a build-in stand at the back to prop it up to a 45deg angle, SAT800 does not.SAT800 has a auto and manual mode, CA-40 has auto.SAT800 displays the octave of the note, e.g. 1E, 2E, etc, CA-40 displays only displays the alphabet, E for all oactaves.SAT800 has a numerical display for the cents off, CA-40 does not.The needle graph on the Seiko is much more stable and it is just way more usab
B000EE8YPK used for my guitars also great for adjusting intonation on a guitar...used on open tunings and bass as well as my Mandilin... ..."
B000EE8YPK What happened to all the Korg tuners that had LED lights on it? Don't get me wrong this tuner works great and makes tuning to E flat much easier than on a non Chromatic tuner but that's ALL I use it for. I prefer my older tuners that light up, This screen is really dim and there's not a back light. My guitar room isn't super bright and it's very difficult to read.Guess that's why the price is so cheap."
B000EE8YPK I sent this to my grown daughter for her birthday and she has been very pleased with the product. I have three tuners myself and I find the Korg to be portable, easy to use and easy to read. Battery life appears to be adequate. Oh, and not to forget...accurate. Shipping was faster than advertised. A \"thumbs up for this one\". Amazon comes through again on price and product."
B000EE8YPK My only criticism is that for the size of the screen the readout is reallysmall and a bit hard for an old blind man like myself to see."
B000EE8YPK I've owned several inexpensive Korg lcd tuners over the years. Like all of the others, this one is excellent, reliable and durable. I keep this one on my bass guitar gig bag to tune up before and during gigs."
B000EE8YPK This tuner works fine for the flute and clarinet however for things that use the input jack it doesn't really work. As soon as I insert any cord into the jack it automaticly goes to a very low B flat and stays there... Even if the guitar and bass are not on the other end. At first I thought it was my cord however after four cords doing this, I also tried other tuners with the same cords and they worked fine. So again works good on the sound input but poorly with cord input."
B000EEEYCW I've been very disappointed with this tuner. When I've used it the needle keeps jumping all the way to the right(sharp) then back to the left(flat). I have two(2) other tuners I bought from Wal-Mart and I always get accurate tunings from them.  I bought this KORG because it's a brand name and the Company has an outstanding reputation. Even though my tow(2) Wal-Mart tuners are older, they both still work better than this KORG."
B000EEEYCW I have tried several different brands/types of tuners in my 13 years of playing. I have found that this model fits my needs perfectly. It quickly detects the tune, dynamically changes as you turn the tuning pegs, and is extremely accurate. It also has options to tune flat, sharp, guitar, bass, etc.It is also small and portable. I have one in EACH of my 12 guitar cases and it fits into the accessory pockets/pouches perfectly. I cant recommend this tuner enough.As always, please indicate if this review was helpful and keep on rockin'"
B000EEEYCW The quality and feel of this tuner is very good. Tuning the guitar is really easy, just put the batteries in (it comes with 2 AAA batteries) and press the red button to turn it on, then pluck the strings! This is my first tuner and its great already! It's very portable."
B000EEEYCW This thing works well and is a little easier to see and less jumpy than my old tuner.  The LEDs are a little cheesy compared to the old one though.  But maybe that saves on battery life.  I don't know.  It gets five stars for just doing its job quietly and for a fair price and not breaking.I'm also glad I bought the one specifically for guitar/bass and not the chromatic one."
B000EEEYCW This was the easiest tuner I had.  I am sorry I gave it away now when I upgraded.  LOL"
B000EEEYCW Wonderful to use - as soon as I put the batteries in and started even without reading the directions - easy"
B000EEEYCW There are better tuners out there. Far better. This could be good, but it seems to me that all Korg products seem to think of Standard tuning as the only tuning out there, and they don't even tune it well to Standard (especially when tuning the G string)! I personally play exclusively in Standard for my electric playing, but sometimes I want to fiddle around with open-tunings on an acoustic. This piece-of-junk makes it incredibly difficult to tune to any tuning using \"F\" or \"C\" notes. I have no clue as to why that is, pretty stupid if you ask me, especially once you consider that majority of this generations guitarists are metal heads playing in drop c tuning or acoustic d-bags (I say that with love) that play in open tunings. Trust me, your money is best spent elsewhere."
B000EEEYCW Bought to tune my bass. Works fine and at the this price it cant be beat. Highly recommend for budget tuner."
B000EEEYCW It works beautifully. Arrived on time as promised as expected it is durable and it is easy and accurate as well, is as described."
B000EEEYCW Had to return the first one.  Second is holding it's own.  Just using it on an electric not sure about acoustic.  Spot on when used correctly inline with cables."
B000EEEYCW All tuners like this are going to be a little \"jumpy\", none of them are perfect.  This does the job perfectly once you get the hang of it.The Korg Pitchblack was a little out of my price range, so the GA40 is working perfect for now.  Overall this is a fair priced tuner from a reputable brand... five stars."
B000EEEYCW I AM SELF TAUGHT GUITAR FOR ABOUT 15 MONTHS.  WITHOUT THIS I WOULD BE LOST.  I WORK WITH A GUY WHO HAS PLAYED GUITAR FOR 30 YEARS.  HE TUNES IT TO ITSELF .  WHEN I HAD HIM TRY MY TUNER HE FOUND THAT HIS GUITAR WAS TUNED TO ITSELF YET SO FAR  OFF.  FOR $15 YOU CANT BEAT THIS.  DON'T BE SO CHEAP. BUY THIS AND ENJOY IT!"
B000EEGAJW I always buy the gross pick package and this is a damn good deal.  Never had such colorful ones though :)  If you need picks do the math.  It pays. ships fast as always."
B000EEGAJW Fender Heavies, what more needs to be said?  Great price for the quantity.  Just buy it so you don't have to worry about losing a pick or storing extras around various places."
B000EEGAJW I love these picks. I buy tons of them all the time. If you are like me and prefer to just strum tunes on your acoustic then these are the picks for you. I prefer thin picks for basic strumming as I am a beginner guitarist and they are more forgiving."
B000EEGAJW i bought these because i couldn't see spending $4.50 a dozen at the local music store. I figure 12 dozen will last me for years. Get them for yourself if you use and lose picks like I can easily do."
B000EEGAJW These are the best celluloid shell-colored thin picks around.  Tried all the off brands but came back to Fender picks in the end."
B000EEGAJW I have used Fender Thin 351 picks for 40 years but always in either solid black or swirl brown. These picks are great because when you drop them on stage or in a dark club you can find them easily."
B000EEGAJW I started using the confetti picks years ago, when I used to occasionally drop my pick.  No matter what color the floor/carpet/stage is, you can find your pick easily.  No lost picks.I like the extra heavy picks.  They suit my playing style well.  I don't have to wait for it to snap back, It doesn't bend. They don't break, either, although they do wear down over time.KMC Music Inc shipped fast and I got free shipping.  When I buy a gross, I only need to buy picks about once every 7 years.I would recommend these picks to anyone who likes a heavy pick!  Thank you KMC Music Inc for fast shipping!"
B000EEGAJW These are the only picks I use.  They're Fender thins and the quality is one thing that Fender has kept consistent.  They arrived on time and I will order them again."
B000EEGAJW These picks break way too easy.  I only play a few times a week but they dont seem to last long when playing for more than a few hours at the time."
B000EEGAJW Great heavy picks, amazingly cheap price.  You really can't go wrong.  I lose my picks continually (Bermuda Triangle in my Laundry?), and this has been great to have an endless supply..."
B000EEHCUS very pleased"
B000EEHCUS I don't know if they are the best (haven't tried them all), but from what I've tried, none are better. D'Addarios are top quality, and very reasonably priced. My choice for 12 string or 6 string acoustics."
B000EEHCUS Nice bright and full sound. Good life, they sound good for a couple of months. Inexpensive. Fast delivery. I am happy with this product."
B000EEHCUS Guitar tone is more subjective than almost any other topic.  And I'm sure that brand loyalty has as much to do with our perception of that tone as any other ingredient.  Even so, D'Addario has provided a consistent product for more years than I'll readily admit to knowing. I've used may other brands, but I seem to always return to D'Addario for all my steel stringed acoustic guitars."
B000EEHCUS These strings have soothed my poor sore fingertips...They are very light to play and make my practising easier whille Iconcentrate on building callouses  ; )"
B000EEHD4I even though i ordered large...still not fitting...will do a little homework to try to get this reemed out a little more to fit...i do not have giant hands so large should fit...but not this...very well made...heavy if thats what your looking for...arrived on time..but...good luck"
B000EEHD4I This is a very high quality Slide and really serves the purpose very well. Try one...............I think that you will love it, if that's what you're looking for."
B000EEHD4I After experiencing some frustration with the tone differences and the difference in the amount of noise between a Stevens steel bar (for lap playing) and a Dunlop 210 glass over-the-finger slide (for \"Spanish style\" playing), I decided to try the Dunlop Harris tapered brass slide.  It's probably a personal issue, but I much prefer the weight of the brass slide.  The taper seems to cover the stings of my resonator guitar more consistently than the straight glass slide.  The sustain is better and the string noise is easier to control.  This slide also seems to be well made and has a nice shine to it.  The material and the fact that it fits better than the glass slide are significant pluses.  Another practical plus for the brass slide is that I don't have to worry about what would happen if I drop it.  In short:  it's a winner."
B000EEHD4I I never use slide to play my guitar, this is the first I ever have, look like good quality, I just have to learn how to play ;-)"
B000EEHD4I When they say small, they mean small.  I had to order the large to get it comfortably on my ring finger, and my hands are not large by anyone's standards.Find the same slide in Large, and I wrote a complimentary review there."
B000EEHDIE Got them today and put them on a Wasburn X series.  Nice sound. I would recommend these to anyone. An inexpensive but nice set."
B000EEHDIE Sounds and feels nice. I have an entry level guitar, a Peavey Rockmaster. It came with entry level strings. These strings make it sound like an upgraded instrument.Be advised, the low E string is thick. When I try to depress the 12th fret, I can't get it to register as a hit with Rocksmith 2014 unless I press HARD with my middle or index finger. Well, sometimes the pinky is needed to do that. Plan on a weaker score if you learn guitar using this game."
B000EEHDIE I have used the EXL115W set for years.  Nice to have the whole set again.  Sometimes have to buy the EXL115 without the wound third, and then have to find the wound third in a single string.  Not fun.  I like the sound of the wound third.  I play a thin hollow-body electric and love how the strings sound and are easy on the fingers.  No more thick calouses on the fingers.  Playing weekinds and practicing, they last a long time with the same sound quality."
B000EEHDIE They have a nice thick sound, bright enough to be clear, good mids, nice bass notes, clear trebles. I like em."
B000EEHDIE I got these about five months ago and they still have not broken on me. That is a record. The tones are warm and welcoming, not as sharp as with other strings. It is the sound that I like though."
B000EEHDIE D'addario has been at the forefront of quality and long lasting strings for as long as I can remember.  This guage is perfect for all my arch top guitars."
B000EEHJS8 It is very easy to apply, great results and very little effort. I'm surprised by the results. Never got this shine in my guitar with any other product."
B000EEHJS8 this is great stuff....only problem...no order...i guess im used to lemon pledge on furniture...this works fine...smooth slick finish...yes...guitar slips a little off my knee...but very happy just wish had sometype of order...yes..nice order..tks"
B000EEHJS8 First wax I have bought. I usually don't wax. I tend to use cleaning sprays. I am going to be waxing now on. Gerlitz makes this wax easy, not greasy. This tin should last a lifetime. It comes with an applicator designed for contours of guitars. I would use just the minimal amount and still get a mirrorglaze. Leaves no ffingerprints or smudges. My classical guitar sounds better after a dose of the GERLITZ GNO NO 1 CARNUBA GUITAR WAX!!!!!"
B000EEHJS8 I purchased this wax for a brand new guitar to help minimize scratches on the back though I make every effort to avoid them, and to protect the side where I rest my arm when playing to keep from wearing through the finish over time.I've used Carnuba car wax many years ago, and this is a much higher grade, easier to apply, easy to remove.There were some really tiny cracks in the polyurethane finish that I did not notice at first and I was actually able to fill them using a couple of coats of this product so they now look like tiny indentations with a smooth surface. They were very minor and did not affect the wood, but this will seal them. Not a sufficient defect to return the instrument.Another reviewer mentioned a problem applying to metal. I have open tuning machines, and before applying Tri-Flow with a pinpoint applicator, I used this wax, let it dry then buffed it out with a pure cotton towel. The chrome is gleaming. They're really beautiful. Did a great job on the headstock as well with MOP and abalone inlay when the strings were removed. Also got the tuning pegs. This is a 000 - OM acoustic. Only way I can imagine harming metal is you slightly dampen the sponge, (I used distilled water) so if someone left too much water - possibly a problem, but all worked fine for me."
B000EEHJS8 I bought this wax and compared it to Meguiars I've been using for years and it surpasses Meguiars by miles. I have a few guitars and they really shine with this wax, you can really see the depth of the paint with this wax and it works great on headstocks also. I like the applicator and the fact that this is a paste wax which is effortless to apply.Along with a few high end guitars, I also have a few beaters. I used this wax on an old Squier that is thoroughly used and it looks fantastic. fine scratches and blems are gone and the guitar looks great.I use old t shirts to buff the wax off the guitars and found that it comes off chrome easilly, I overdid it with an older Les Paul guitar and was surprised to see the wax come off with ease. I will buy this stuff again and again, my local guitar shop sells this for the same price."
B000EEHJS8 This stuff works amazingly. If your interested in buying the product, don't listen to the people who say it is too dry. I thought it worked good, and mine was a bit dry. This stuff isn't supposed to be really waxy, its a hard wax so I would think it was supposed to be cracked. Mine wasn't that cracked, and it worked great! I love this product and would definitely recommend it and say this is a must-have."
B000EEHKVY I really feel like this thing is my personal slave, just standing off to the side, waiting to grab my guitar when I hand it off. It is reliable and rock solid. The tripod base has been very steady so far. It really is a great product.The other thing I have to say about this stand is that it has the non-scuff padding on the all the RIGHT places. I bought another stand from another company that claimed to have similar material. And it did, but not at all the guitar contact points.I do have to laugh at the folks here and on Musician's Friend who have given this a bad rating because of the following:1. \"It ejected my guitar when it got tilted forward.\" - The basic idea is their guitar was on-stage, someone pushed the stand forward, the patented guitar retaining mechanism disengaged when the base of the guitar touch the floor on the way to the ground, releasing the guitar and dumping on the floor. REALITY: Let's say the stand held onto the guitar. It still would have hit face first and messed up the guitar. Sometimes accidents happen. Don't blame the stand. Blame the moron who knocked over your guitar.2. \"The guitar touches the floor.\" - It's not supposed to! Try elevating the next, or make sure you bought the model appropriate for your kind of guitar.This stand is worth the extra money over those $15 disasters. Spend an extra $10 and save yourself the headache."
B000EEHKVY The absolute best guitar stand made. Strong, and durable. I bought one about 4 months ago, and just ordered a second. Hercules is by far the best quality for musical instrument stands."
B000EEHKVY I've been eyeing these stands for a while - ~$40-50 always seemed like such a lot of money for something to just hold a guitar upright. I'd spent a little money (usually $5-10) here and there on cheapy little stands with the spinning base. Now that I finally have one of these, I'm throwing those pieces of junk out and buying a few more of these Hercules stands.It hold acoustic and electric guitars very well. With the extendable neck, it can also handle a bass guitar. The angle this leans back makes it very stable, and when a guitar is hanging on it, the center of gravity is such that it takes quite a bit of force to tip the stand over. It holds both electric and acoustics. I haven't done any full drop tests, but regardless of which guitar I put on it, the stand didn't once feel like it was going to tip over easily or drop the guitar.Piece of mind is key with an instrument that costs several thousand dollars, and this stand lives up to expectations, and does exactly what it's meant to do."
B000EEHKVY The stand is very well constructed and very stable.  The other stands that I have used were all bottom holders.  I was a little concern using a stand with a neck holder, but then again..all guitar stores display their guitars with them...so I thought ... lets have a go,  I'm glad I did.  My stand doesn't tip over like the others.  You just have to lift up before you take your instrument out.  The fingers in front hold the instrument in... lifting up slightly will disengage the fingers so you can remove your instrument."
B000EEHKVY I use this music stand for my acoustic bass and electric bass these instruments are quite large and it secures the very well and they are very easily accessed  . I also use it for my acoustic tenor guitar which is on the other end of the scale in size and it works beautifully for it, Breaks down to a reasonable size for transport."
B000EEHKVY My only complaint is that it doesn't fold up smaller, but otherwise this is an excellent stand. I have to concede I'm a bit spoiled by the super light weight and much more compact folded dimensions of myK & M Memphis Pro Guitar Stand. However that light weight comes at the cost of a slightly more fragile build. The extra heft of the Hercules has the advantage of slightly better stability when you remove the instrument from the stand (the K&M; tends to want to bounce backward as the weight is removed if used on a padded carpeted floor). Despite not folding up quite as small, the Hercules is simpler to unfold and adjust (one action for legs, one action for height, whereas the K&M; has three separate legs and two vertical sections / clamps). I do realize that I bought the one without the folding yoke and am not considering that aspect when comparing it to the K&M.; Length and girth folded would still be quite a bit larger than the K&M; (large enough that I won't try carrying it in my gig bag pocket as I do the K&M;).I'm also not convinced Hercules' trade mark pivoting finger yoke is all that necessary on this type of stand. The back angle and the fact that a good portion of the instrument rests against the padded legs means it would take so much force to knock an instrument off of it that it's knock the whole stand over. No big deal, just more parts (and weight). I think I prefer K&M;'s yoke, as it automatically adjusts inward to the width of the neck as weight is applied. The Hercules has a fixed width yoke with pivoting \"gates\". Both work perfectly well with my Fender and similar bass head stocks.I've had two of the K&M;'s and the second was a bit of a disaster. It was defective in more than two areas. Defects happen, but one highlighted a weakness which concerns me a bit, and lead me to try the Hercules(I won't go into all of that here, see my review on that product). Aside from the potential weak spot of the yoke, the Hercules should prove to be far more durable and tolerant of my occasional clumsiness. I'm glad I purchased this one and I think I'll get plenty of use from it. But I should mention, it did allow me to better understand and appreciate the strengths of the K&M;, mainly its awesome portability (despite its slightly more fragile nature).In the interest of further comparison, I've got anUltimate  GS100 Support Genesis 100 Guitar Standon order, and will review it against this and the K&M; as well. I opted for the GS-100 without an automatic closing mechanism over the GS-1000 which has one for the reasons I stated above- I don't believe it is strictly necessary. The reviews of the GS100 are also more favorable, and the GS100 is cheaper (which suits my cheapness."
B000EEHKVY I've been playing the guitar since the 1960's, so I've gone through plenty of guitar stands.  Always found the hanging-type to be the safest & most secure.  For a long time I was using the Hamilton chrome hanging stand.  When I first saw these being used by all the guitar players at the church I attend (Christ Community Church, St Charles, IL), I decided to give them a look.  The build quality is very good and all the sections that come in contact with the guitar (Electric or Acoustic) are padded with a foam material to prevent scratching/ denting.  It offers a very solid support and I feel safe putting my guitar on it.  This is the only type of stand I prefer to use.  I do wish it wasn't made in China, too much of our money goes to that country (just my opinion).  The bottom line is that I am very happy with this stand and would recommend it to any guitar player who wants a sturdy, well built stand that keeps the guitar safe and should last for ever."
B000EEHKVY I heard alot about these stands and finally decided to buy one after my cheapo one fell over with my bass still on it.This is a nice looking, well designed stand and feels like it can withstand the rigors of constant use. However, the 5th time I took this to a show, I expanded it and one of the screws and nuts attaching the back leg to the support bar fell off and I never did fine the missing screw...wound up wrapping electrical tape around it to support my bass for the night. I ended up buying some screws and fixing it (which was also a pain as the nut needs to be inserted about 6 inches down the pipe and secured so you can thread the screw into it....not an easy task. I really expected better quality for $35.00 after such light use....still love it, but not to a 5 star level."
B000EEHKVY I bought this stand primarily to hold my Epiphone Les Paul. I have owned the other cheaper stands which are not built as well as the Hercules. The stand holds the guitar in place by the neck and the bottom of the guitar rests on the padding of the stand legs. There is no room for movement of the guitar like you fins with other stands. I can also move the guitar in the stand from room to room without issues. I plan on buying another one to hold a rather large acoustic guitar. I like how the stand is completely adjustable and locks into place.I strongly suggest this stand for heavier guitars rather than the cheaper stands out there, the extra cost is well worth the investment. I bought this at my local guitar shop for $40 after looking into it, the manager of the guitar shop recommended it to a few people while I was there.UPDATE 11/5/12- A few weeks ago, I bought myself a second one seeing the amazon price was lower than the local retailers. I usually buy locally, but the deal here was great. The stand is worth the price and more."
B000EEHKVY This is hands down the best guitar stand on the market. It will last a lifetime and never drop your axe. I have two of these plus a wall mount hanger for my basses and I love them all!"
B000EEHKVY I had been leery about leaving my Fender 5 string Custom Jazz bass on guitar stands until I met the Hercules GS414B.  The stand is \"built like a tank\" with sturdy legs and a strong upper support that fits the neck and headstock of my bass perfectly.  My bass weighs about 9.5 pounds with the strap and with its long neck, fits perfectly in the Hercules, with the body of the bass resting  well-balanced against the padded legs.The design and reclining angle of the stand makes it extremely stable and I experimented with trying to tip the bass over. It will take more than  an \"accident\" to tip the bass off its stand.  The self-closing mechanism works very well and requires no effort to lock or to unlock.The lock is engaged by simply placing the bass in the locking mechanism.  The lock releases by lifting the bass from the stand.My only dislike is the bright yellow paint on the leg hinge mechanism. I would have preferred  the stand being a more conservative all black."
B000EEHMXA I love these strings they are a little more mellow than most mando strings so they sit in the mix and let the guitars cut though a little more. I'm hoping they last a while!"
B000EEHMXA I bought a cheap Rogue A100 mandolin, and after setting it up I of course replaced the cheap factory strings.  I put these on, and what a difference.  These aren't too heavy, not too light.  They ring nicely.  I find that coating bronze strings with a good string cleaner, like Dunlop 65 Ultraglide, can help you avoid the dirty fingers and get much more life from the strings."
B000EEHMXA The J74's are sort of the default string that mandolin dealers put on their instruments.  They are bright and brassy when new, and give a decent punch to the sound.  However because they are bronze, they can discolor your fingers and they tarnish pretty quickly, especially in the summer when your fingers are sweatier.  Also, since they are round-wound, they are harder to fret than a flat-wound string and harder to shift up and down.  But the people who like them change them often, like once in 30 days or so, or whenever they play a gig, to get that nice bright brassy punch for when they are new.  This is because they get to a point where you have to work harder just to get the same volume, being less elastic, and less lively.  One thing is sure, that the J74's are loud and zingy, and that's why dealers put them on their mandolins.  Some folks move to the heavier J75's to get even louder and fatter woof on their chops.  The J74's are brighter and more aggressive than flatwound strings and cut through when you're in ensemble work.  Just make sure to change them often to get the best performance."
B000EEHMXA D'Addario strings have become the favorite for all my guitars, and now my two mandolins. Consistent quality and good tone and volume have made me loyal to the brand."
B000EEHMXA What more can I say? These strings sound GREAT! They play wonderfully, work well together, have a nice brilliant (but not tinny) sound, and are excellently made. These are not going to unwind on you or break easily.Excellent. That's all there is to say about it."
B000EEHMXA I am using these strings on an inexpensive A-Style Beginner's Mandolin; these strings made a significant difference in the quality and tone of the instrument; I strongly recommend these strings."
B000EEHMXA I've never bought strings before so it is kind of hard for me to rate these.  So far so good!"
B000EEHMXA Quality strings at a very affordable price.  They are made from quality materials and care is given with quality control to ensure the buyer of a good product."
B000EEHN9S I am learning to play the guitar. I needed a place to place my lesson book that was a little more ergonomically sound. I debated between this one and the other popular/slightly more expensive one. I cannot speak to that one's assembly process, but I found this one to be reasonably simple.I also like how you can just pull or push the stand in order to raise/lower it. The same goes for tilting. It is a superb stand with ample table space for book, iPad, capo, some picks and if you are creative, headphones. I love it and I am using it almost every single day. Very solid construction and the stand with the most height I could find.Go ahead and compare specs of each of the stands offered. As of today, this is the one that wins in the height, shelf and space categories."
B000EEHN9S I think someone else wrote that this is like the music stand they used in high school band class.  Yup, it is.  I would buy again.  My use is to hold my books while I try to teach myself how to play guitar.  This stand could easily hold a phone book as the lip is about 2+&#34; high.  Very happy with it.Just a warning to those that are picky.  Because of the way the tube locks together, the part that holds the music can shimmy a little if you knock or brush it.  Not an issue for me, but also did not want someone to think this is like a brick and won't move.It would be hard to tip over because the quality and thickness make this puppy heavy.  Buy it, you'll like it.  It will survive a nuclear blast."
B000EEHN9S This is the stand you remember from the band room. Effective, and built like a tank. You will need a wrench to assemble (a very simple task). One note - the metal feet would scratch some types of flooring, invest in the optional foot covers if you're concerned."
B000EEHN9S this stand is VERY GOOD ! nice and strong , i recommend if you can only afford a low price one to get this , it is worth a lot more then 29 dollars, this will last a life time, and its not real heavy you can pick it up and move it easily,,i was looking at the cheep fold up ones and read some of the reviews and then remembered seeing them in different yards out by the trash cans to be picked up with the trash,, so i looked for something better and ,i am so happy to have found this , at this price.i didn't want to pay more then 15 dollars for a stand ,but i really wanted something to last and if i bought one for 9 or 15 dollars and in 6 months its in the trash ,i would be buying another one , so really ,this is the BEST DEAL , i am SO HAPPY I BOUGHT THIS STAND you can't go wrong with this one,,,REALY !! get it !  it will hold a few books and stand should not tip over,its heavy enough not to, it slides up and down nicely, and the book shelf  tilts easly and stays and you can turn it as well, .,bolts are NOT plastic,witch is nice,,and very easy to put together and fast,,i got it together in one minute,i only used regular pliers to put it together..  the stand goes low enough for sitting or high enough for standing up while playing instrument,i truly recommend this for anyone  ! (i did get the foot guards for $1.95 to protect floor, on carpet you will not need them ,)and it comes with a 10 year warranty ,and with the free shipping you can't beet it,"
B000EEHN9S I read the reviews with low stars, the major complaints are squeaking sound when you twist the head. We use it to hold the musics and don't need to turn the head. The heads of music stands on stage are fixed too, if they turned, they could not fit into the music stand rack. This one work great for us.We have several music stands,  we didn't like them not because the heads can't be turned but they are unstable and can't hold thick book."
B000EEJ8IM Good cheap basic metal slide, sounds like it should. Only problem is I prefer to wear it on my ring finger but I have big hands (viz XL and XXL gloves) and the slide is too small to fit except on my little finger. A bit annoying but not the slide's fault I guess!"
B000EEJ8IM For the price, i'm really happy. It's my first one i get and it's perfect, i'm learning how to use it and it's not as easy as you guys think."
B000EEJ8IM I lost my trusty slide and really miss it. The Dunlop 220 feels heavier and looser on my little finger than my old timer but, it does sound sweet. If it was just a bit smaller diameter, that would do the trick. My old timer had enough corrosion inside to keep it secure so, a brand-new, sleek fit isn't a plus in my case. The Dunlop is well made, as expected. It's just not the Antiques Roadshow model I had in mind. Hmmm, might be a new product idea - rough up the inner surface and come up with a catchy name."
B000EEJ8IM I am a basic player and just starting to explore the possibilities of using a slide.  this one works fine so far.  it is rather heavy and I like that.  I also like that because it is metal, if you drop it on the floor, it is not going to break like my glass one did.  Be sure to get your correct finger size before ordering however.  otherwise it may come too big or small for your chosen slide finger."
B000EEJ8IM Sweet \"twangy\" sound that is a flash from the past of steel lap guitars.  I have a ceramic and this steel slide.  Each has a unique sound.  The steel as expected has more of brighter twang.  When I change my strings, I know that I'll get some differences in tonal quality, but hey, experimenting for that sound that reaches us is what keeps all of us buying new toys."
B000EEJ8IM Make sure you order the right size! I don't use this product very often but it provides great sustained and does not kill strings."
B000EEJ8IM very good slide smooth sound and reasonably priced  I use it with my 12 stringer in open g tuning  would buy other products from this company"
B000EEJ8IM Fast delivery, and exactly as advertised.  Put it to work making music within minutes.  The steel gives a clearer sound than the glass  bottle slides,  but you need both.  Good product."
B000EEJ8IM I did purchase 3 diferent slides this one is mark as a medium but is diferent size from the other one's what I ordered. Perhaps is good for some one with small wrong size . This is why I give only 3 stars because is to small for me."
B000EEJ8IM Well i got this after hearing seasick steve its cool i havent figured it out just yet but its a very good product"
B000EEJ8IM Great sounding slider for my electric AND it won't shatter when you drop it on the floor like the more expensive glass ones do. Plus the medium weight of it is perfect for my smaller hands to control the slide action. It has a great sound for the modern electric guitars, but is not really meant for lighter acoustic performances. I recommend."
B000EEJ8IM I have several different slides (glass, brass, steel, short, long, etc.)And this has become my go to for every slide guitar session I play on!I wear it on my ring finger, It fits great, the tone is amazing on acoustic, electric and banjo!Works great for blues, rock, a little stoner country, and even some metal! (the main genres I play in)Harmonics and sustain to spare!I keep it in my pocket at all times now, it goes with me everywhere, And has never failed to lay down some mojo when I bring it out!"
B000EEJ8IM This would have been a nice slide if I could get it on my finger.  I'm borderline skinny and it still won't fit.  Save your money unless your under 10 years old."
B000EEJAFS I love these picks, especially in this gauge. They are a bit thinner than the jazz 3s, so if you master em, you can in theory, play faster ;) They have a good grip, and a nice texture. The tone it gives isn't bad either."
B000EEJAFS Black Tortex picks with silver lettering.The Jazz picks are about 25% smaller than standard Tortex picks and have a more pronounced point."
B000EEJAFS I've been using Dunlap's Tortex picks now for going on 10 years, and recently just switched over to heavy Jazz picks (smaller - sharper tip). These picks work great. They provide enough surface area that they won't slip easily from between your fingers. They allow for a high level of sensory feedback from your fingertips once you get used to them. Any jazz or soloist guitar player would likely find these extremely comfortable to use. I also prefer the high thickness so there's no flex in the pick while playing which makes it easy to judge the pressure you're putting on the strings."
B000EEJAFS Nice picks, much brighter sounding than the jazz 3 nylon picks. I prefer the jazz 3s since thr jazz 3s are warmer sounding and wear resistant. but these pitch blacks are not bad. They do wear down quickly but a dozen should last a good amount of time.  This pick does what jazz picks are suppose to do and in my university's jazz ensemble the three tips are useful and makes playing difficult jazz chord  easy. It will feel awkward at first if you never used jazz picks but once you get the hang of it you'll never go back to standard picks."
B000EEJAFS If you like Jazz Guitar picks and if you like Tortex picks this is the perfect marriage.  These are the best.  Enjoy."
B000EEJAFS I've been a Jazz III fan since 1997 starting with the red (too buttery and rounded sounding) and then moving to the black (durable but a bit tubby sounding). Eventually I tried a 1.0mm Tortex of this pick which had good attack but was somewhat mushy sounding through amp sims.But then I tried this .60mm and holy cow the sound change was like getting new pick ups. More mids, more attack, faster attack, scratchier attack, and less lows. Now you'd think this would make your guitar sound thin, and indeed it sounds thinner but also clearer by a factor of two.Thus when recording through amp sims, you get a clearer more dynamic more attack-ish sound. When using the 1.0mm the fundamental was a bit too strong which made for a mushy amp sim sound, but this .60mm did the trick. It just sounds heavier, tighter, and more articulate. While it does wear faster, for recording purposes it's my current ultimate pick of choice.So if your guitar doesn't sound clear, articulate, or aggressive enough first give this pack of picks a shot. But you don't have to take my word for it... da-nehh-nan!"
B000EEJAWQ I like them but I love the Schaller locks more. They don't feel as secure as the Schaller locks. Sorry"
B000EEJAWQ i really like these...use with thick walker williams straps and evernthough they are thick straps they are soft enough to get these on..  the washer that goes on the strap is extremely thick and you have to fight it...but once you got it its a fine product..enjoy"
B000EEJAWQ These are definitely my favorite strap locks there are plenty out there but these ones are mine I've always been a huge fan of Jim Dunlop products and will continue using them for years to come"
B000EEJAWQ This system does not fail. Install it and you never have to worry about it again. Although it's a good idea to lube up bearings every once in a while. I put these on all of my guitars!"
B000EEJAWQ I use these on all my guitars.  Love them.  Easy to assemble and use.  If you have trouble putting it on your strap google for some videos showing you how to use a pliers to push the clip on.  Once installed they are fantastic."
B000EEJAWQ Here's what strap locks are supposed to do: securely attach your strap to your guitar. These do that much better than Schallers and the Fender rip-offs of Schaller.I used the Schallers many years ago. They look great, but the problem is they screw onto the strap with a nut. I am very good with maintenance, check for loose parts, etc., but at one gig with my super heavy American deluxe 5 string jazz bass, the nut worked its way off the strap, and I dropped it. It was with a heavy leather strap, and I did tighten it down with pliers upon installation and I'm sure I kept it maintained. Absolutely ridiculous and inexcusable. Never again. Unless you want to inspect and retighten your strap locks at every single rehearsal and gig, forget about Schallers. They're a good company and they make great tuners, I don't fault the materials, it's simply that threaded things can work their way loose, a fatal design flaw for this type of device. Come on, its only purpose is to not allow something to come off of something else.The Dunlop strap locks fit on with a locking ring. It is impossible to remove these from the strap by accident. If you're having trouble getting the lockrings on, I have a YouTube video posted to my channel, NickWeissMusic, just search for Dunlop strap lock installation. It's kind of tough at first but with experience, it's very easy. The package instructions are correct but not very helpful.I have these on more than 10 instruments, and have never had even close to a failure in well over a decade. The package recommends periodically lubricating the mechanism inside the lock, but I have never done so, in my experience lubricants usually gunk things up more than they help for things like this. I've never had so much as a grind or squeak from the button or ball bearings in these strap locks, if I did, I'd probably just replace it. I do give the locks a little tug when I put them on to make sure they're engaged, other than that, you can forget about them, which is the way it should be.The only possible downside is that these strap locks keep the strap a little further from the instrument then using no strap locks or the Schallers do, to which I say, who cares. Well, I guess a lot of people care about that, since I see it in a lot of reviews. If using no strap lock or a poorly designed one is worth it to you, just so you can have your strap a quarter inch closer to your guitar, so be it. I have seen Ernie Ball strap locks that seem to be a little lower profile, I think they use lock rings too. Maybe try those, but I'm sticking with the flawless track record of the Dunlops."
B000EEJAWQ A bit invasive and awkward.  I like another brand more because they feel a little more solid..  These feel a bit weak."
B000EEJAWQ I buy Dunlop locks pedals straps they all are top quality and I love them all. you need a strap strap locks or pedals buy dunlop"
B000EEJE4K I just got these in and I have to say, very disappointed.  It's as if I went into a boy's shop and bought a large shirt and expected it to fit a man.  What do they call medium or small?  This \"large pick\"  barely goes over my thumbnail area. I can hold it, sort of, so we'll see how well it works with my hybrid plectrum project.  (BTW, I'm an average grown man, 5'7\", 165)  More to come...Here we go, a few months later:  I just had a chat with a music store guy and found out that a \"large\" thumb pick refers to the thickness of the pick!  Bottom line, if you want a thumb pick that fits, go to a store and try before you buy!  Good luck to all."
B000EEJE4K Iv'e tried a lot of thumb picks( i use them for bass) you no what that doe's to them,these are the one's i'm staying with these thumb's."
B000EEJE4K I've been using National medium thumb picks for the last year until my last one broke.  Decided to try the Dunlop.  Overall - I'm very pleased with this pick.Previous reviews have indicated that these picks are smaller than the National mediums.  This is true, but isn't a complete description.  Basically, the National picks are much more elongated - so while the nail to thumb-pad distance is about the same on both, the across nail distance is much greater on the National picks.  I actually find the Dunlop pick to fit much better, and I don't get extra overhang as with the National (which tends to catch the string)."
B000EEJE4K I wear a large sized glove, so assuming that would translate, I got these.  While I can force it over my thumb, it is very tight and uncomfortable (i.e., pinches).  My thumbs don't have a particularly excessive diameter either.  I'm gonna try to heat these so I can stretch them a bit.  I know they need to be snug so the pick doesn't rotate when being used, but this is ridiculous.  Three stars because if they fit you, it is a nice pick (it would be 5 if they were described correctly for sizing)."
B000EEJE4K These items, though well made, and strong, are sized rather differently to National picks - With the National, I need a Large, so I ordered Large in this item - it is, however very tight, smaller in fact than a National Medium thumb pick.Essentially a waste of money."
B000EEJF4O I have a gibson les paul that I bought used. When it arrived the fretboard was in good shape, but very dry. I first tried lemon oil and it would work, but in about a week the fretboard would feel dry and have an ashy color to it (its rosewood). So I started looking for another solution and found the Gerlitz Guitar honey.I ordered it and applied it.  A few hours later I restrung my guitar and started playing and didn't care for the way the fretboard felt. I think it is because the guitar honey is a little thicker than lemon oil and it felt a little slimy because it wasn't completely dry. I decided to give it another 24 hours.The next day the guitar neck looked and played great. It is a darker color than any of my untreated rosewood fretboards and plays like a champ. Bends and slides are smoother than ever.Great product and one that I will continue to use. If you need a quick treatment before a gig or something, I would recommend lemon oil because it dries quickly. But I would use this in every other regular maintenance situation."
B000EEJF4O This treatment, after I let it soak in for 24 hours, made my fingerboard look great and play fast. A little goes a long way!"
B000EEJF4O As I mentioned in my review about guitar polish (already forgot what kind), I'm not really a guitar polish connoisseur, but this makes my fingerboards feel real good.  It got rid of that scratchy feeling when I bent strings, dissolved the crud, and makes the fretboard look just lovely.  It probably works as a fine hand conditioner too, but who can say.  Again, because I'm rather slack on the guitar maintenance thing, this bottle will also last me years."
B000EEJF4O I used this on the fretboards of my electrics and acoustics. It was easy to clean and left the wood feeling soft and polished without that slick feeling that other oils do. Highly recommended"
B000EEJF4O Works as advertised.  Makes the fretboard look and feel nice! I imagine this stuff will last for quite a long time as well since you only really use this when you're changing your strings."
B000EEJF4O I use this on the fretboard of my new Hohner wc03 Parlor and two Epiphone AJ220sce Acoustics. They had mimimal oil/stain from the factory.  Keeps the wood smooth and beautiful for much longer than a few weeks.  I use it every other time I restring my guitars, It is a really good product, I use it on all of my guitars, except my Strat that has a maple neck.."
B000EEJF4O I bought this to use on an older acoustic guitar neck which was a bit faded and after 2 uses, the wood looks great again. I used the honey twice in 2 days and brought back the maple wood to like new condition.This honey works fast and well and will make playing the fingerboard alot easier. I saw this in my local shop for the same price minus shipping after I bought this, but I do not use it much so it should last a long time."
B000EEJF4O I bought a guitar that had been sitting in a guys closet for the longest time, and the fret board was so dry and colorless. I used this, and the color became rich and less dry. If your fret board is pretty dry, DO NOT remove the oil. Let it sit overnight and then remove it with a towel. Leave it longer depending on how dry the fret board is. I love this because it doesn't leave an oily residue and it doesn't have a smell that stands out. I didn't even notice a smell. I definitely would say this is a must-have."
B000EEJF4O I requested this for Christmas in 2011 and was pleased to get it. I've used it on at least 7 guitars and it works great. First I used it to treat clean fingerboards that were in good shape and it worked well. It can even make a big improvement to the dry, porous surface of a cheap fretboard, and good rosewood fingerboards love the stuff.Later on I got some used guitars and used cleaned the gunky fingerboards with Guitar Honey (apply it, scrub with toothbrush, wipe with paper towel, repeat) and it did a lot better than I expected at removing the yucky buildup next to the frets.I like to apply it fairly heavily and lay the guitar down with the fingerboard level and facing up, and give it time to soak in. You will notice that some areas soak it more than others. I move it around on the fretboard so it soaks in evenly. Then wipe off the excess with a paper towel and you're ready to go.When I wipe down the strings after playing the first time or two after treating with Guitar Honey, the rag shows dark lines where the Guitar Honey cleaned the strings. I like making my strings last longer!Get some. I don't think you'll regret it."
B000EEJF4O I have a lot of high end instruments, and I live in New England so proper fretboard care is a must - especially with ebony and other woods that are prone to cracking and drying.This stuff is fantastic - MUCH better than lemon oil, dries a lot cleaner and doesn't leave any oily residue on the board at all. An hour after it's applied it sets up and doesn't get on your hands. I apply it on occasion with the strings on (I use Elixirs) and have never once had a problem.The best few bucks you'll spend on guitar care. 5 Stars."
B000EEJF4O This stuff is great. Leaves board clean and fast. No residue, no sticky and no oil film. Price is right. If you use any fingerboard treatment, try this one..."
B000EEJJ5Y Just bought this to see if it would inspire any new sounds for me.  WOW I love it.  The capo works great with no buzzing and holds the strings down well.  I am using it with a Seagull Entourage mini jumbo.  It sounds divine.  It makes chords nice and open and it is a blast to play with on the folk sound of the seagull, a nice mellow relaxed open sound.  Inspires my ears to make music.  Buy it."
B000EEJJ5Y This capo is great for adding another level to your guitar playing without retuning your instrument!Highly recommended! Just a nice sound it brings to your playing and has a bunch of great new chord combinations to mess around with!"
B000EEJJ5Y I play in different tunings and just slapping this on a standard tuned guitar makes for a lot of fun.  That's all I can say.  It makes me creative and I have easily thrown together a dozen instrumental fingerstyle tunes using this.  It's just fun."
B000EEJJ5Y This partial capo from Kyser has the same design, construction, and ease of use as Kyser's top-ranked and bestselling 6-string cano. It is definitely recommended. If you choose to go down he partial capo path, though, it's best that you either jam with friends who are familiar with partial capos or buy Randall Wolliams' manual on the partial capo, since its use is not intuitively obvious."
B000EEJJ5Y this capo helps make aesome music, thankful for it, i like using it for all kinds of palying, like at the beach"
B000EEJJI6 I've been using this for roughly a year now, and it works fine.  It feels a bit cheap, but then it IS cheap.  It's not as easy to move as a spring-loaded capo, but it's also much lower profile.  Overall, I like it and it's certainly worth the (minimal) price."
B000EEJJI6 This is a pretty good deal if you look at the price of other capos, and you get free shipping.Yeah, it's not as quick to use as the spring loaded ones, but still not bad; better than an elastic strap type.It is also great for creating your own short cut and drop D capos.  With a sharp razor you could do all sorts of crazy stuff.Do not overtighten the screw because the bottom arm is thin. You can add a pad of some sort, or just take care to not to over-tighten it.I'm the type of person that would glue in a small piece of material if it broke through.  So, far it doesn't look like it will though."
B000EEJJI6 This works with equal ease across all six strings, or only the bottom three.  Haven't run across a need to try it on the top three by themselves yet. But judging by its performance on the bottom three, and its fierce grip, it'll do just fine."
B000EEJJI6 It'll do for setup work, and the price is right. I wouldn't recommend it for live use or for anyone who changes keys every song, its too fiddly to adjust and get firmly set. I also wouldn't recommend it for anyone just starting out. A spring clamp type capo would serve better. This one is probably best for somebody who rarely needs to use it, and just wants one one hand or to keep in the case as a back up."
B000EEJJI6 works like it is suppose to, good quality.I am able to produce my music with the proper sound needed for the song.Thank You Kyser Capos"
B000EEJJI6 I bought the capo for the guys at a correctional facility that I work for. It gets abused, so I don't look for it to last long. Would not buy it for my own guitar."
B000EEJJI6 Works great, but it is a little annoying to have to tighten and loosen the screw to use every time.Some responses to comments I've seen in the reviews:--I've had mine for 5 years, used moderately, and the wear on the metal from the bottom of the screw is negligible. Haven't put a pad there or anything.--The manual screw functionality does, I feel, give an added level of control...you can make it very tight to ensure no buzz.--However, range of motion is on the wide side. To get it to properly capo the first fret on my acoustic, I have to put it right on the edge of the 1st string, and screw it down all the way, and it does sometimes leave some buzz.The price is nice though, so I would recommend it as a perfectly fine capo."
B000EEJJI6 I prefer my spring loaded capo, but this one works ok on my guitars. I'm surprised I haven't broken it yet."
B000EEK4VM I got it today in the mail, and i already tried it. It's really cheap product but it works really well. I'm really happy with it and it made me save several minutes to change my strings."
B000EEK4VM This string winder is adequate but not really solid. It gives me good use but seems like the materials are to soft. I had to glue the contacts on this thing since it gives way at times. This is just adequate for my use."
B000EEK4VM I hate winding strings. I got this to help with that. It does it job very well. You can string your guitar in a fraction of the time. It could be a little tougher but as long you don't give it hell it will be fine. Great and cheap product!"
B000EEK4VM Pretty simple tool, did exactly what I needed it to for a decent price. I'd order again if I needed another one!"
B000EEK4VM Nice to use and easy and smooth in putting the guitar strings on place on the guitar - very easy"
B000EEK4VM It is a nice smaller version of the 114SI Road Pro.It would be great if it had a steel shaft.The plastic shaft feels like it will break.But it is cheeep!"
B000EEK4VM this makes winding strings MUCH faster, but it does feel flimsy, and the end piece doesn't fit over my tuing pegs correctly, so it's a bit of a haslle getting started. Other than that it's great for the price, but not a must have"
B000EEK4VM And that's all I've got to say about it. It hasn't stuck, broken, or slipped in any of the string-changes I've used it for. Costs a little extra, but well worth that price. You'll need a new one about every ten years or so."
B000EEK4VM I bought this cause i needed something to easily change the strings on my guitars. This thing works great. For the price you can't beat it. Maybe one day I might get the powered one but until then this thing will do. Fits in your pocket, gig bag, etc. So you can have this thing on the go. Works great and you can't beat the price."
B000EEK4VM Lets face it, in general string winders are pretty much all the same right? WRONG! I went with this one because I trusted the Dunlop name. What a let down. on the second guitar I used it on the handle and the head separated, sure you can press it back together, but after separating several times on every string, it gets a little old....quick. Already ordered a different one to replace it. One thing I cant stand is inferior tools."
B000EEK4VM Jim Dunlop has produced these for more years than I'd like to admit to personal knowledge.  As long as I can remember, I've had one in my case and one on the workbench.  There are dozens of wannabe models, but none are as genuinely authentic as good ol' Jim Dunlop's.  I gotta remember not to get the black ones, though.  I seem to lose them to easily - or maybe they are really that good, and they just get 'borrowed'."
B000EEK4VM A simple device, yet so useful.  I hate changing strings without one, anymore.  Dunlop provided an inexpensive winder that's durable."
B000EEK4VM Ok its cheap. You knew that when you bought it. I really thought it was going to be more then one since it said assorted and showed a few in the picture. It was only one and it was red. Broke with first use."
B000EEL50Q Unique product offering new kind of protection from fingerprints, dust, oxidation, squeaks, or &#34;gummy areas&#34;. 2 or 3 drops on a cotton ball and treat several guitars. This is a thin viscosity lube that shines your woodgrain better than new. I don't like greasy feeling products on my guitars so Dr. Duck 2080 Ax Wax is designed for my needs. I threw  out my Gibson spray. Too oily. Dr.Ducks Wax is worth the extra $3. This bottle will last a lifetime. You could use it on your Johnson if you wack off the finish."
B000EEL50Q Dr. Duck's Ax Wax works great on all of my guitars, including my Nitro finished ones.  Can be hard to remove if you use too much, so apply only a few drops at a time."
B000EEL50Q This was recommended by a guitar repair shop, and I have found it is a well rounded product that all guitar players should keep on hand.  It will polish, and lube things like Floyd Roses.  Do your strings get funky from the acid in your skin oil?  Wipe them down with a little DR. Duck's Ax wax before you place your guitar back in the case.  The secret is always use the least you can get away with.  Too much for polishing and you will be rubbing it off forever."
B000EEL50Q Use very little of this. Rub it on and it then dries like wax then buff it off. It also lubes your strings. Good all around product."
B000EEL50Q Does it all.  Perfect for cleaning and waxing guitar; don't need a bunch of different items; this does it all."
B000EEL6J6 I dunno, cause I'm stingy with stars.  These have a nice sound.  I had an old guitar I bought for cheap at a garage sale for my son (8 at the time) to play on, but never really cared for it.  I finally got it out and started to tune it, but the steel strings broke.  SO I replaced with these.  It's a classic guitar, it shouldn't have had steel strings to begin with."
B000EEL6J6 great sounding strings. you can hear the difference once it is used. i will try to buy another one after i have proven its performance."
B000EEL6J6 These are really cheap strings but how they sound!! really good!! obviously not for serious live performing but for playing with friends or just rehearse, these are the ones!"
B000EEL6J6 D'Addario strings have never failed me. These are so much better than the other nylon strings I used to buy where the ball end always broke. These strings sound nice and you can't go wrong with the price tag either."
B000EEL6J6 I have a Don Pablo Cuban guitar, made in 1969,, for a few months,,, never change the strings,, and sounds great,,, I put this strings,, and wao,,know sounds wonderful,, few guitarist fellows could not believe the sound of the guitar after the string change,, try,, this are the best"
B000EEL6J6 Restrung my guitar with no problems. These were my first set of new strings so I dont really know what to fuss about hen comparing strings but these seem to work fine and have a great tone. I can really hear the difference between new and old strings. The strings are nice and smooth, and springy, very easy to press on."
B000EEL6J6 These take a while to break in but the tone is smooth and warm. They made my Cordoba C5 sound like a more expensive guitar. Not overly bright, just a richer tone"
B000EEL6J6 I bought a cheap 3/4 guitar that sounded really bad.  I replaced the stock strings with the D'Addario strings and it made it sound much better."
B000EEL6J6 Great prce"
B000EEL6J6 in the old days, we used tobe able to buyall 6 NYLON clear strings....now tis almost impossible....with these strings on even a cheap or semi decentclassic geeetar....one will prefer playing on the hi 3 treble strings...very nice, resonant, and clean...not shrillbutwhat is that garbage metallica with the other 3 supposed to bebass strings i dont know...Again, like someone else NOTED the OBVIOUS>>>>>sound transition from the nylon to the wire wound nylon is GIGANTIC.This makes the move from the D to the G string too noticableCANT THEY EVEN MAKE  6 strings that sound similar for the same one guitar even ?makes it sound like 2 different geeetars totally...sucks bad now.oohthanks man"
B000EEL6J6 I can't really say anything negative about this set of nylon strings.It sounds really good on my classical guitar. Will buy it again in the future."
B000EEL6J6 I've played guitar for some 35 years and have found D'Addario strings to be of consistently good quality.  They are one of maybe three companies I trust to manufacture a good set of strings no matter what classification of instrument.  Whether classical (nylon), acoustic (brass) or electric (nickel)... their strings produce excellent sound and are durable.Like any string, one needs to match size and construct to personal playing style.  That comes through reading reviews and quite often, simply testing.  But I've never played a set of this brand that I didn't like.  They always provide vibrant tonal quality.And no I don't work for D'Addario; just a long-time fan. : )"
B000EEL8US I love these picks and the .88mm seems to be the perfect balance of stiffness and suppleness for my playing."
B000EEL8US I am a LONG time user of the big Fender triangular picks.  I play rhythm guitar in a bluegrass here in Columbus, Ga.  I play mainly a Martin HD-28, but also have a Blueridge BR-180 and a Seagull S6 Coastal Spruce.  I bought a set of these to try them out.While I have nothing negative to say about these picks, I still prefer my big Finder's.  I guess I'm just too used to the big pick.  While I was playing Katy Daley with one of these Tortex picks, I found that my index finger was hitting the strings, on occassion.If you haven't been tainted for the big Fender picks, then try out a set of these.  I guess I could get used to them, but will stick with the big Fenders for now."
B000EEL8US These are my favorite picks to play with.  The Dunlop Tortex Picks have such a nice warm sound on acoustic."
B000EEL8US These are excellent guitar picks.  They don't slip in my fingers like the Eddie Van Halen guitar picks I purchased a while back."
B000EEL8US Tortex picks are the best.  Pitch black is so cool.  1.0 mm is the perfect thickness.  Don't buy those other picks, buy these because Tortex ... Black .... 1.0 mm is the perfect combination."
B000EEL8US If you have not used Tortex picks before, I highly recommend giving them a try.  They are NOT flimsy plastic that cracks and splits like most of the tortoise shell picks you see.  These are much more flexible so they last forever.  The only reason I've ever needed to get a new one out of the package is because I lost the one I was using...Just be aware that 0.50mm is really light for most players.  They do sell these in many different thickenesses and colors, so give order a few different ones to see what you like.  My favorite is the 0.70mm...  it has the perfect balance of flex and strength."
B000EELB8W I sprayed on all my guitars.  No problem with any chemical reactions.  It polished the body of the glossy guitars up like new.  Now i can see how guitar stores keep them looking so nice.  It must be from a product like this.  They seriously look brand new.  Makes nicks and scratches less noticeable.  If you want a nice looking guitar for the stage or display, this stuff works."
B000EELB8W Used this on my mandolin and it brought back the new instrument sheen it had lost months ago. I sprayed it on a bit of cheesecloth, used that to rub the instrument down, then wiped with a soft Chamois, worked like a charm."
B000EELB8W I love the Dunlop Formula 65 polish and cleaner. It works really well, and I like the easy to use pump spray mechanism. I've used other brands in the past, and they had poor spray nozzles. This one works almost like a mist. It does a good job of removing smudges and fingerprints. I spray it directly on the surface of the guitar, and then wipe it off with a flannel cloth. After I'm done the shine looks glassy and great!"
B000EELB8W It has a pleasant smell to it, not harsh at all. A little goes a long way. My guitar polishes up really nice after wiping it down with the dunlop 65. nothing to complain about."
B000EELB8W I can't say I'm a polish connoisseur, but this stuff seems to work very well.  It shined up all my instruments and got rid of all those nasty fingerprints and smudge marks.  I'm not very diligent in my guitar maintenance, so this bottle should last me for years."
B000EELB8W Dunlop 65 cleans the smudges and fingerprints off, but I dont know how well it actually polished. I like it well enough, just make sure you have a microfiber cloth to keep from scratching the lacquered surfaces."
B000EELB8W I get a lot of grease on my guitar from lotion, sweat, fingerprints, dust, what have you; I take some of this, spray it on a cloth, give it some elbow grease, and my guitars are shiny as the day it was made. I use it on my acoustic and electric guitars. The bottle lasts pretty long cause the mist is pretty fine. I use two sprays on the cloth for the front side of the guitar and then repeat for the back. It has a fresh lemon scent. I recommend this to everyone, a lot of product for an affordable price."
B000EELB8W Very nice polish! I have thirteen guitars and I would like to keep them all looking as great as they were new! Gets very shiny and smooth almost like its new from the guitar shop! Use it on everything!"
B000EELB8W Friend of mine has been playing/cleaning/modifying guitars for some 30+ years and this is what he recommended I use on my guitar to clean it.  Who am I to argue with him, he's used them all and said this was the best.  Easy to use - a little goes a long way, works very well and shines up nice.  He was right - great product!"
B000EELB8W The standard for mild, non-oily instrument cleaners. Leaves no residue, easy on old guitars' finishes. I have used it for years."
B000EELB8W Item arrived on time and as described.  My son loves this polish/cleaner.  He likes to keep his guitars clean and shiny.  They glisten when he uses this to polish them.  Great product!"
B000EELB8W I was looking for a cleaner and a polisher to get the grease and grime off my guitars. I decided to trythe Dunlop Formula 65 Polish & Cleaner. I thought, why not try a 2 in 1 formulation? After all, thereare shampoo and conditioners in one bottle, and that works well for me. So why not this? Possiblyfaulty logic but I went with it at the time.Well I have to say that it did well. I used a soft cotton cloth, placed some Formula 65 on the cloth(Not the guitar) and slowly worked on the more oily looking areas of my Gibson ES-339. This guitarmodel has a high gloss black lacquer finish. The Dunlop Polisher & Cleaner did a very good job on thefinish and did not leave any streaks behind.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------It was after using the substance all over the guitar that I realized that one must not get Formula 65in any cracks or chips. I am thankful that I did not have any of said cracks or chips. I am usually oneto read directions thoroughly; but not this time. No harm done but I will make it a point to inspect myguitars for cracking or chipping prior to using Formula 65 again.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This stuff works well. It was able to lift off, with some effort, greasy build-up over the last year. I amnot a messy person but oily hands can and often leave smudges that mar the surface of the finish. Notonly does it clean up the oils from my hands and gosh knows what else, it also left a nice shine as well.The finish looks very good. This 4oz bottle will go a long way. It doesn't take much to work.I tried using an untreated micro-fiber polish cloth and that only pushed the oily mess around. That iswhen I decided to get the Dunlop Polisher & Cleaner. It definitely worked a lot easier than the un-treated micro-fiber cloth. I am now using the micro-fiber cloth to rub off any new smudges as theyoccur. I plan to re-apply the cleaner/polisher when I oil my fret board a couple times a year.I gave the Formula 65 Cleaner & Polisher 4-1/2 stars due to the fact you can potentially do damage toyour guitar. Chips and cracks do occur throughout the course of a guitar's life and can be expectedalbeit not wanted. So 4-1/2 stars because it does what it says it will do but you've got to be carefulusing it. So...be careful out there people....NOTE: There is a \"California Propositon 65 Warning\" on the web page under 'Product Details'. Amazonhas placed it there as a public service. It reads: \"WARNING: This product contains chemicals knownto the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm.\" Just thoughtyou ought to know."
B000EELB8W Up until a few years ago I had been using the same old brand I'd been buying for 20 years.  Then, I tried this recipe... Dunlop 65.  It is wonderful.  It does everything the product description tells you about.  Excellent cleaner on both wood (painted and natural) and metal.  I use it to clean not only the body, but the tuning heads and bridge on my bass guitar.  No nasty residue build up over time.  It cleans and polishes just like it was designed to do, without streaking and so on.  You'll like this stuff better than anything you've used to date....or at least I think so.  I sure do."
B000EELB8W Spray on a fairly minimal amount across the body of the guitar and rub down with a lint free cloth.  Shines nice and doesn't leave it feeling oily/sticky.  Smells nice and makes your guitar looking new!"
B000EELB8W This polish works well for what I need it for. I am not a clean freak but I take good care of my instruments and this works well not only to remove the crud and fingerprints from a gig, but puts a nice shine on the guitar without having to work to hard with the polish to get there."
B000EELB8W I like this cleaner - it's gentle on my guitar finish and it doesn't smell bad either."
B000EELB8W My buddy used this for a long time so I thought I'd give it a try. Shines up guitars very nice. I use it every time I change my strings for a little zaz. It does It's job in fantastic fashion, but doesn't last the longest. The shine will fade soon enough, but looks great while it lasts."
B000EELB8W This is the best guitar cleaner and polish I have ever used. It cleans the grime and greasy fingerprints off very easilly and leaves a brilliant shine without a waxy/greasy feeling that cream polishes leave. This is a must for black guitars. Great product. Only wish was that is was bigger than 4oz. It's quite expensive for 4oz. But 2 or 3 sprays does the whole guitar including the neck."
B000EELB8W Took away my fingerprints and dust off my guitar and polished it to a shine that you couldn't see a reflection in yourself!"
B000EELB8W provides a great finish with a nice glossy shine.  Does not leave streaks if used properly.  This dries quickly every time."
B000EELB8W Have used it on a couple of ukuleles.  On my old dirty beginner uke that had been sitting in a closet unused for years it really made it look like new again.  I'm satisfied."
B000EELB8W This has got to be one of the best polish ive ever used on a guitar?Going to also last for a long time, cause just a small amount goes a long ways."
B000EELB8W I have many acoustic guitars and I use this on all of them to keep them looking good. Easy to use, wipe on and wipe off."
B000EELB8W It really makes your guitar shine! Also I use it on my guitar neck and fretboard and keeps it smooth and shiny. 5 stars. Also the price is right."
B000EELB8W This is just an excellent product. I have been using this product on my guitars for over a year now and as long as they keep making it, I will keep using it. You only need a very little bit to polish the entire guitar and you don't need to use it for every polish. Once you put it on initially, you can simply buff your guitar with a dry cloth for the next two or three cleanings and the shine comes right back. There is enough in one bottle to last a very long time.I highly recommend this product and would like to also refer you to the Dunlop 65 lemon oil for cleaning your fretboards. The lemon oil very quickly removes any residue and shines the fretboard up extremely well. When it dries, your fretboard is beautiful and very smooth for all your bending and sliding tricks. 50 stars."
B000EELB8W Puts on a good shine for your instrument.  I like the spray bottle applicator.  You can even apply a shine to the fingerboard area underneath the strings."
B000EELB8W I love this product! It is very cheap and the spray bottle makes it very efficient for distributing an even ammout of product on your guitar.  You end up using just the right ammount.  Would definately recommend it!"
B000EELB8W If there are still people out there who don't believe in magic, just try this. It has truly elevated my playing a few notches. I'd probably have bought another bottle already, but this one seems to be lasting forever! I've had it a few months now, I use it pretty much a few times everyday, and it still seems full.If after using this your playing doesn't improve, then maybe you should give up guitar."
B000EELB8W Nice Polish/cleaner  Really works very well on the finishes I have (cheap glossy chinese electrics, and a matte finish acoustic).  handy to have when your changing strings (to clean that nasty fretboard- wow do those things get dirty!) Pleasant scent (lemon oil), and no residue.  Lasts a long time (2 or 3 squirts will do an entire guitar."
B000EELB8W Love this stuff, I have been using it for years and it always does the job well. Cleans polishes and has a pleasant citrus scent. Cleans off grease, fingerprints, old beer and restores that sweet shine."
B000EELB8W I've relied on this stuff for years, and it has yet to let me down.  I play my guitars quite frequently, and they tend to collect a fair amount of sweat, etc., during a show. A couple sprays of this product and a quick wipe down with a guitar chamois return my axe to its shiny self, with zero degradation to the finish. I've even used this on matte or light finishes with good results.Tip: a little goes a long way. I play every week, I use this stuff every time I put away a guitar, and it still takes me at least a year or so to finish a bottle.  I figure this stuff costs me about 25 cents per month.  :)"
B000EELB8W It's cleaned and polished pretty my Taylor guitar pretty well.  I would recommend this.  If not this one, at least buy some kind of cleaner/polish.  Protect your investment."
B000EELB8W You can use a standard eye-glass cleaning cloth (about 2 quid) with this instead of buying a micro-fibre cloth (at 5 quid) they both do the same, imo. You could also use eye-glass cleaning solution instead (which I have in the past) but this special solution works better on the wood and laminate surface of guitars - but not on eye-glasses (smiles). This really does shine up your wood quite well. I recommend."
B000EELBQ4 I am just learning how to play the mandolin, one of the problems I was having was supporting the mandolin and fretting the notes, since I got this strap adjusted I no longer have to hold the neck so I can concentrate on the notes, I like the fact that you can unclip the strap at either end without touching the adjustments so I can put it into my case without having the strap laying across the neck, yet pick it up and with one click it is ready to play."
B000EELBQ4 There aren't enough uke straps out there for a good price.  This one is great.  I take away one star because the padded part could be a bit smaller, lighter."
B000EELBQ4 I had purchased a different strap for my F-style mandolin and it was adequate but when I learned of this Neotech strap and how adjustable it was I ordered it and tossed my earlier strap.  This should be configurable for any mandolin body size and shape and for most human body sizes and shapes as well.  My only complaint is that the button hole doesn't stay on the end pin of my Epiphone mandolin.  I solved that issue though by taking a large triangular pick I wasn't happy with, drilling a hole in the middle and cutting a notch from the edge to the hole and then sliding this over the end-pin of the mandolin and the strap hasn't fallen off since (over 2 months of daily playing!)"
B000EELBQ4 This strap is uncomfortable and too flimsy to feel good, also doesn't fit an instrument where there's no place to hook it .  I returned mine, as it just didn't fit well for my uke or mandolin."
B000EELBQ4 This is a good quality product as advertised, fits well and enhances my efforts to play this instrument! I am satisfied."
B000EELBQ4 Recently acquired an Ovation mandolin, which itself is hardly &#34;standard&#34; in appearance, materials, etc., so I thought it would bea good opportunity to try a &#34;non-standard&#34; strap. I'm impressed! I'm thinking of picking up another for a more classical mandolin..."
B000EELBQ4 It's definitely high-tech, but since I don't own a classic-looking or vintage mandolin, I don't really care about looks. My primary concerns are comfort and function, and this product gets five stars on both counts. I really like the fact that you can attach the contact points, and using the click-locks, remove the strap from the instrument while leaving the contact points in place. Also, if you get the strap twisted up while installing it, just undo the click-locks, take out the twist, and reattach it. Pure function! This strap was very well designed and thought-out before going to manufacture. Five stars!"
B000EELBQ4 As others have said, the stretchiness of this strap makes the instrument seem much lighter and I am less likely to get an achy shoulder when playing for long periods of time.  It may take a few tries with different configurations of the attachable/detachable extensions to get it just right for you and your instrument, but don't give up, it's worth the effort."
B000EELFI8 This is a good looking strap. Much lighter and thinner then any strap that I have had. It has to be half the weight of others but that makes it very comfortable.Looks great on my blond Tele.The price is right as well.I like it"
B000EELFI8 not your fender quality strap.  this is a cheap, extremely low quality strap.  I've had it for a few months and my guitar has not fallen yet, but I can see the wear on the end it's almost at breaking point.  I would not recommend it. It's ok as an emergency strap or to get you out of a jam, nothing else."
B000EELFI8 I decided to get this tweed strap for my 50s Telecaster Classic, but when it arrived, I was a bit let down. The tweed finish is cool enough, but the strap is very thin, and the strap ends are pretty poor quality. If they truly are made of leather, I feel sorry for the hide they came from. The leather is so hard, you almost need fingers of steel to get the eyelets spread far enough apart to get them around the guitar strap locks.This is decent for the time being, but I am definitely going to keep my eye out for something more suitable to my guitar. Feels like wearing a $10 Casio with a $1300 suit..."
B000EELFI8 The tweed really grips on your shirt, the quality is perfection and they even give you a little string, if your using it for acoustic which I thought was sweet! Love fender."
B000EELFI8 Not a flashy strap but great in the studio or on stage when you need to change guitars fast.Light weight allows you to remove quickly.It is pretty comfortable to wear also."
B000EELFI8 I have three of these straps more my Strats. Very comfortable and durable. I really like the metal link as opposed to the plastic link which hold the strap itself to the the leather button hole. Great product!"
B000EELFI8 For the price this is a pretty nice strap.  It's thin but does the job well. The simulated leather end pieces are noticeably &#34;cheap&#34; but its a guitar strap and has not failed me yet :)"
B000EELFI8 I used to buy leather straps but not any more. This strap is very nice and comfortable. It's also the cheapest one I ever bought. Can't go wrong."
B000EELFI8 Not much to say...I wanted  Fended tweed guitar strap and this is the exact item in my sights. Thanks, it does what it's meant to do!"
B000EELFI8 For the price this is a wonderful strap. It can get twisted and wear out, but keep it straight and it will last you a long time. It has a vintage look, very soft and comfortable. It also has that vintage Fender coolness factor. I have 30+ year old leather straps that will be around years after I'm gone but I paid a lot for them and they're not as comfortable as this. I've even used these on Gibson's (oh, the shame) but of course they look best on Fender's, I guess. The truth is they will work on anything. The strap ends are great, but they're not really secure. Gaskets can take care of that. I own quite a few of these are they're great quality, look cool (in a vintage kinda way) and feel soft on my shoulder."
B000EELFI8 I chose this for its good looks, but was pleased by its construction as well. A very well-made strap with great looks and a super price. My only complaint, which is very minor, is that I think the webbing could be thicker and have a more sturdy feel. It just feels lighter than I like, but that's a personal thing. I have no complaints about the construction, the looks or the price. I use mine on an Irish bouzouki, and it really looks great and works great. I don't like straps that have smooth liners that allow the strap to slide around. This cloth doesn't slide around, and that's a good thing."
B000EELFI8 Sorry Fender...this one is just a waste of money.  Get something better that doesn't twist up an ravel into knots."
B000EELFI8 Beatiful, amazing strap. Very soft, very confortable, sits perfetcly on fender strap lock, and looks like my G & L Custom Fender Select Case. What else, so?"
B000EELFI8 I have gotten comments on how cool it looks, I'm finding that I prefer a thicker strap, but this strap works perfectly"
B000EELFTW Unlike some other reviewers I have found no quality issues with mine, it came symmetrically bent with a plastic pad that doesn't smell like anything, it holds my harp exactly where it needs to be and is easy enough to remove, all I need to do is loosen the bottom wingnut, rotate the harp away from my mouth, and lift the frame over my head.To change out harps bite down on your harp, use your hands to depress the tabs on either side and then pull your head back sliding the harp out as you do, to insert a new one place your harp in your mouth, depress tabs and use your mouth to center the harp in between the plates, when it is in position release tabs making sure not to get your lips caught between the harmonica and the plates as they pinch shut."
B000EELFTW The harmonica barely fits the holder, and there is no adjustment for distance from the mouth to the harmonica. I can't get the harmonica adjusted close enough to play it, unless I modify it."
B000EELFTW its cheap//it worx// what more to say?welp...only other thing to say is ashame that itdoesnt have like a thin brass slip washer with oneof those finned lock washers on the adjustment wingnutsand it'd be perfect!!! (nope...i still havent found those lilbrass washers that size in my stash so im on the hunt :Dblow-on bruthas n sistas!Doc P."
B000EELFTW I wish there was a fine pivot/angle adjustment to orient harp to mouth. I feel I have to angle my head awkwardly to use harmonica no matter how I set it up. I have a big neck and a prominent jaw so the armature does not extend as far as I think I need it to - causing the position of harmonica angle to be awkward for me. for the angle to be right it would be in my mouth ( LOL ).This is the least expensive holder I could find Nov 2013. Since it was inexpensive comparatively I will use a vice and bend it to suit me if my grand nephews don't want it.Also not sure why they don't make these wider to accommodate a larger variety of Harmonicas as it has a very strong spring action holding harmonica in place, could easily hold a much larger and longer harmonica if designed to do so. a 5 star mechanism 4 star armature design."
B000EELFTW I ordered both this one and the Lee Oskar.  I couldn't find a usable position with either and was about ready to return them both then noticed that the shoulder piece on the Hohner had &#34;raised&#34; ends.  I reversed this piece where the ends angle down instead of up and it works ok.  The quality appears good.  The springs that hold the harp in are STRONG but by holding the harp in my mouth and using both hands I can change harps without removing the rack.This was my first shoulder rack and I didn't know what to expect.  I have to have it adjusted exactly right to be able to go from harp to singing and it's challenging but I can get it done."
B000EELFTW This holder, and just about every holder I've ever bought, doesn't hold a harmonica at the right angle for me.  They all need one more joint to adjust the angle. I've had Hohner racks before so I was prepared.  I use harmonica holders for kazoos.  This one has a decent spring and may not require the use of duct tape or wire to hold the kazoo in place.  I may add the wire or tape just for the kazoo aesthetic.  The angle for kazoo use is fine.Obviously not everyone's head and neck are the same as mine.  This holder may work well for harmonica for some people.  If you can, you should try on holders before you buy."
B000EELFTW I prefer this design that is fitted to hold the exact size of a diatonic compared to the style that is made to fit any size. Great quality, lasts forever. You won't be dissapointed."
B000EELFTW Great harmonica rack, for smaller harps.  Very strong in the set when worn.  A must have for any folk player."
