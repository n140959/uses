B0013OX9NC Lutein is found in many dark green leafy vegetables such as kale, spinach, turnip greens, and collard greens, etc., and is good for maintaining good vision and prevent macular degeneration.  The macula is a small area of the retina responsible for central vision.  Lutein accumulates more in the peripheral areas of the retina while zeaxanthin accumulates more in the macula region.  Both lutein and zeaxanthin are believed to have anti-oxidative properties and protect the retina/macula from harmful blue light.  My family and I try to maintain a well balanced nutrition but it's helpful to supplement regular leafy green vegetable intake with Lutein supplements.What's good about Jarrow Formulas (JF) Lutein:>Each softgel contains 20mg of lutein (esters) and 1mg of zeaxanthin.>My family's eyes tend to be less strained and our annual eye exams indicate no vision health problems.What's questionable about Lutein supplements in general:>20mg of lutein esters usually yields approx. 10mg of free lutein.  The amount of free lutein absorbed by the retina/macula is unknown.>We've taken the JF brand of 20mg lutein supplements since 2010 and there are no noticeable differences compared to other brands' 20mg geltabs.>There's no DV or Daily (recommended) Value for lutein or zeaxanthin.  Possible side effects of excessive lutein intake.>Each geltab contains mostly soybean oil and the softgel ingredients of gelatin, glycerin, and water.Overall:Taking lutein geltab supplements is helpful but it's more important to maintain a balanced, healthy diet with plenty of leafy green vegetables, wear blue light blocking sunglasses, and don't overstrain one's eyes, etc., to maintain good vision and retinal/macular health.
B0013OX9NC I have been using Lutein for years as macular degeneration runs in my family. When I saw the Jarrow formula I was thrilled as I know that Jarrow makes good products. I was not disappointed. The gel was small and easy to swallow, and these pills will be replacing my previous Luteins in my daily vitamin routine.
B0013OX9NC It is common to avoid taking care of your eyes. Since taking Lutein, my eyes feel younger. I can feel the difference.
B0013OX9NC My eye doctor recommended that I use Lutein and I started using these about two weeks ago. I don't see a lot of vision improvement, but am using it more as a preventative for macular degeneration. So far after two years use, no macular degeneration!I really like these particular softgels. They go down easy, don't upset my stomach and seem to be more organic than the last brand that I purchased. I will continue to use these.
B0013OX9NC I've always had exceptional eyesight (20/10), but as I've grown older I've been noticing a decline in my vision. After doing some research I decided to start taking a Lutein supplement. I wanted a supplement that contained at least 20mg of Lutein at a reasonable price. This Jarrow Formulas product fit the bill, so I ordered a bottle. I've got about a week's worth left and I can definitely say my vision has improved. I can't say it's solely from the Lutein because I also quit drinking soda/pop after finding out that Aspartame is bad for eyes. Additionally, I started taking a Bilberry supplement around the same time I began taking this Lutein. Regardless, I know my vision is improving so I will continue to take Lutein and Bilberry supplements. Thanks for reading.
B0013OX9NC My DH has terrible trouble with his eyes getting inflamed, his sight floating so his new glasses don't work that well, and just eye strain in general. He's been to any number of opthamologists and regular doctors, none of whom have been able to tell him what is wrong. All they can recommend is eye drops to keep his eyes from being too dry. I do know his father had macular degeneration, so we're going to try this formula to see if it will help him. The lutein, as I understand it, concentrates in the macula of the eye and helps with focus. The pills themselves are soft and not too large, kind of like a roundish Vitamin E capsule but a little larger, so I hope he'll take them.
B0013OX9NC I figure these would at best help with an ongoing macular issue and at worst do nothing. The seem to have done nothing whatsoever in 2 weeks. The softgels are easy to swallow - not as large as a typical vitamin and that's a good thing. They did not cause any digestive upset or issues - some supplements can have unforseen & unfortunate stomach consequences. However, there was no change any sort noted with regard to actual eye care. Oh well... at least they did no harm.
B0013OX9NC An important thing to know about Lutein is that It is best absorbed with a high fat meal.  If you are taking this and are on a low fat diet, perhaps take this with your Omegas or with some type of healthy fat. Otherwise, you are losing effectiveness of the supplement .  For those not seeing benefits, please try taking them with a high fat meal and see if it makes a difference.My diet is already pretty high in Lutein.  One bottle lasted me for two months.  During the two months that I took the supplement, I did notice an improvement in my vision.  So, although I had an adequate intake of Lutein, the extra oomph did make a difference.I would recommend giving this a try if vision health is a concern.  I learned that I could add a cup of cooked spinach to my diet each day and get the same amount of lutein.  I do think the supplements have value and Jarrow is a company that I trust. I would recommend them.
B0013OX9NC Easy on the digestive tract and if they help postpone cataract surgery then they are worth it as I am not looking forward to that.
B0013OX9NC The label tells me what it DOESN'T have ie gluten, wheat etc but fails to tell me that the SOYBEAN OIL is GMO! Over 86% of the CORN and SOY in the USA IS a GMO ingredient.  I will no longer buy this product and will search for a NON GMO product.
B0013OX9NC I'll be staying on this product for 1 year.  In the last 4 years I have developed 'floaters' in my eyes and luckily no macular degeneration.  I also had cateracts removed in 2011.I can't say I have noticed any change in vision in the last 2 months but the proof will be when I see my eye doctor in 10 months and she can tell me if my eyes have changed for the worse. If not, I will stay on the product. $60 a year for a chance to safeguard good eye health is worth it.
B0013OX9NC Lutein seems to be one of those supplements that actually has a solid backing of research to back it up.Basically it helps your eyes, and can help some conditions that effect the eyes, such as macular degeneration, cataracts, among others.The 'pill' (gel pack) is quite small, easy to swallow.  If you have eye conditions (or don't want to), this may be an easy decision.
B0013OX9NC Jarrow Formulas' \"Lutein\" is a dietary suppliment for support of visual function and protection of the macula. The bottle contains 60 softgels which while big can be easily swallowed. There is 20 mg of Lutein and 1 mg of Zeaxanthin in each softgel.Since there is history of eye deterioration I thought this would be a product to try. I have been taking 1 softgel per day as directed on the package for a little over a week now, but it is difficult to almostimpossible to determine the effectiveness of the product. Some doctors prescribe lutein for their senior patients, others say that it will not harm or help your eyes. I have taken other brands of lutein in the past without any side effects. I have found that even with taking this \"Lutein\" with food as directed on the package that about an hour or 2 hours after taking the softgel I experience some stomach and/or lower G.I pain which last several hours. It is not severe pain but is discomforting. Perhaps it is a coincidental that I take the softgel and then experience pain but it has been 9 days in a row. I don't think I have ever had zeaxanthin in the other lutein I have taken and wonder if that may be the cause of the discomfort.
B0013OX9NC Love all the Jarrow vitamin supplements. Jarrow has done it again with the amazing Lutein formula for increased eye support. My 80+ father in law who had macular degeneration swears by this.
B0013OX9NC I just turned 48 years young a few days ago and I have enjoyed many years of good vision.  However, I just started using reading glasses prescribed by my doctor with just the faintest magnification.  I have only been taking these a month, but many studies (and my doctor) recommend adding this supplement to your daily routine.  The Jarrow brand is one that I trust and these are easy to take.  I will be continuing to order these from Amazon.
B0013OX9NC Jarrow Formulas Lutein 20mg, 60 softgels is an excellent product.They are very easy to swallow and if you are over fifty I think you should try them,They really help aging eyes. My husband had an eye problem a few months ago when he saw the eye doctor he said it could be the start of a detached retina. Taking lutein has really improved his condition. I take it as a preventative. A bottle lasts us a month. I will not stop taking it. I would recommend you try it.
B0013OX9NC Don't let anybody tell you that they can see just as well at 70 as they did at 30. It's a smoke screen. Everybody's sight begins to diminish with age. If I can get something into my system to assist in staving off the detrimental effects of age, I'm going for it. Jarrow Lutein is specially formulated to aid vision and comes in easy-to-swallow softgels. It gives me a feeling of insurance against macular degeneration, and I'm sure it helps. Anything you can do for your eyes is a good thing.
B0013OX9NC For those with a Lutein deficiency, this is a pricey, but useful product. I wouldn't buy it unless you're convinced that you need this supplement. Eat lots of veggies instead. :)
B0013OX9NC I've been taking Lutein supplements for a couple of decades with the hope it would prevent or delay cataracts - but it appears that strategy didn't work. I am in the mid phase of cataracts anyway - age 69. According to one web site, researchers found that Lutein and Zeaxanthin reduce the probability of cataracts by about 19% for men and 22% for women, which I agree is statistically significant.  However, 19% certainly isn't anywhere close to 100%. It appears I am in the 81% category. Maybe it would have been worse or occurred earlier if I had not taken Lutein all these years. The minimum amount of Lutein necessary for good results is cited to be 6 to 10 mg per day. So 20 mg in this product should be more than minimally sufficient.
B0013OX9NC There's 20 mg of Lutein per capsule, which is more than most of the eye-oriented multivitamins on the market. Doing some research on Lutein, it is naturally found in many greens such as kale, collard, and spinach. There's no conclusive data that indicates a lutein supplement/diet would help reduce macular degeneration or prevent it, and there's no data that indicates the supplement would actually improve your vision. Preventing blue light from damaging the eye is definitely important, and that is why we have sunglasses and special optics that filter out harmful UV A/B/C radiation.I haven't noticed any side effects from taking the Jarrow lutein supplement, but I also haven't noticed any significant improvement in my vision. I did note that it contains twice the dosage per capsule of Lutein versus the Bausch and Lomb Ocuvite brand supplement.Overall: 5/5 stars
B0013OX9NC There haven't been a huge number of authoritative studies on lutein supplementation, so it's hard to know whether the benefits outweigh the risks. A quick internet search turned up one study showing that by the end of 12 months, people suffering from age-related macular degeneration who were given lutein showed vision improvement, while the placebo group did not.The Harvard School of Public Health also published a study on the benefits of dietary lutein and zeaxanthin on cataracts for men and women ages 45 to 75. They found that people who had the largest dietary intake of foods containing these carotenoids have about a 20% lower risk of developing cataracts than the people who had the lowest dietary intake.However, though these carotenoids are probably beneficial for the eyes, they are not without risks. In a study conducted by the National Eye Institute over a six-year period, researchers found that beta-carotene, another carotenoid, increased the risk of lung cancer in smokers. This raises enough of a concern  about carotenoids in general that I personally would avoid taking lutein in supplement format unless I had a very specific reason to do so, and was testing my vision to check to see whether or not I had reached those benchmarks.Now, about these pills specifically: when you open the bottle, it smells really disgusting. To me personally, it smells like old shrimp, but my partner thought it smelled like old cleaning supplies stored in a cabinet in the garage. In any case, poor reviews all around on the smell. Unfortunately, when I broke open the pills, they taste exactly like they smell. I'd recommend taking the pills prior to a meal, so that you don't burp up any of that odor.When I broke the pills open, I found that it was a clear gelcap housing a thick, pasty orange oil which stained my hands yellow. If you want to take lutein in and oil form, this is a good bet. The primary ingredient is marigold petals, which you may not know is used to color the egg yolks of commercially raised chickens so that consumers are fooled into thinking the chickens have a healthier diet than they do. The gel caps themselves are smaller than the average vitamin pill.
B0013OX9NC This formula of Lutein is exactly what my opthamologist recommended I take for vision support - one a day is plenty, too, which makes this a two month supply if taken daily, but I was told three days a week, or every other day was enough, so I do the every other day.
B0013OX9NC It's hard to evaluate supplements, but at least I can say I have not experienced any ill effects :)I'll report back after a couple more weeks. The pills are easy to take.
B0013OX9NC Safe and effective luctein supplement for those who need it.  The pill is small and easy to swallow as well.  There is a lot of research to suggest these have a lot of benefits for eye health especially.  Jarrow always puts out quality products.  Never once had any issue with their supplements.
B0013OX9NC I am taking Lutein to prevent macular degeneration as it has hit members of my family. So since I am taking it in a preventative capacity, it is hard to tell if it works. But this is cheaper than the Lutein than the grocery store brand. I have really liked Jarrow's products and would not hesitate to recommend them. These pills are easy to swallow and don't have any after taste. They did not upset my stomach.Lutein is important to preserve and protect vision and this is a high quality low cost way to get it.
B0013OX9NC I take a series of supplements as part of my diet and I've recently started to take this lutein for my eyesight. The pill is not too large and easy to swallow. You may not be able to stop macular degeneration from hitting you, but these supplements suppossedly help eye health and I'm willing to try them out. These softgels contain nearly the same ingredients that other eye health supplements have. I have felt no side effects since starting to take these and hopefully they are protecting my eyes!
B0013OX9NC I know many people swear by Lutein, but it has done nothing for my vision that I actually notice. Everyone's different I guess.
B0013OX9NC I started taking Lutein after doing some research into some intermittent eye problems I was having. I noticed an improvement within several weeks, continuing through to a few months.  I have also recommended this to a family member who has macular degeneration.  I'm not sure how well this works on simply \"aging eyes\" but there is growing positive research on the effects on degenerative conditions.  I would even say that my night vision has improved.  As for the basics, I found these capsules easy to swallow, with no gastric upset or noticeable ill effects. I also have a good opinion about Jarrow in general, so I was happy to find this product at a relatively good price and with the subscribe and save option and additional discount.
B0013OX9NC Lutein is something of a wonder product for your eyes and believed to help decelerate horrific age-related disorders such as macular degeneration. I've always had a bad eyesight and after a health scare a couple of years ago I've been very careful about what I eat. There are a range of studies showing the benefits of lutein and although you can find it in dark leafy vegetables, eating spinach and kale every day can get tedious. These tablets are a reasonable alternative and although you won't notice any benefits immediately, I've noticed that when combined with diet there is a gradual but noticeable difference. The soft gels are easy to swallow and incorporate into any morning routine.As an aside, if you want to look after your eyes, you can't go wrong with a daily dose of kale, spinach, carrots and broccoli - the combination seems to eliminate floaters and improve general eye health. Although my experience is only anecdotal, I'd highly recommend increasing your lutein intake if you're having any sorts of eye health issues.
B0013OX9NC I have taken other Jarrow vitamins, and I find them to actually contain the amount they say they contain (unlike some other brands), so I am confident that these Jarrow Lutein softgels have the Lutein they claim to have. If you are looking for a lutein supplement, the Jarrow brand is a brand you can trust at an affordable price.
B0013OX9NC I will definitely be ordering Jarrow Formulas Lutein again. As a woman of \"a certain age,\" I have been becoming aware of subtle changes of my vision. I decided to take lutein because of stories I've read in the news, and this product more than filled the bill. My eyes have become dry and irritated. Of course, there are multiple reasons for this to begin, however, noticing a decline in that irritation coincides with my beginning to take this product. Of course, I have no scientific evidence to offer, however, I know what I feel -- and I do feel better. Recommended!
B0013OX9NC Lutein is vitamin good for the eyes, this Jarrow vitaimin is extracted from marigold pedals, laong w/ soybean oil, beeswax and  mixed tocopherols.The softgel consists of  gelatin, glycerinm, nad waterThe recommended dosage is one soft gel per day.
B0013OX9NC My spouse has a degenerative eye disease and was prescribed supplements to help slow down the formation of secondary cataracts as well as assist in general eye health. Of course, like many physicians, he has his own line of supplement products for sale that tend to cost a fortune.However, unlike many physicians pushing supplements, he also provides the full follow-up testing to show whether or not it was actually working...and it was as evidence by the amount of plaque build-up and impact on the lens. So far so good. Of course, the cost still left a lot to be desired.When this came up for review, we opted to give it a try as it contains many of the same active ingredients in roughly the same doses. The Lutein combined with other eye enhancing supplements all in one formula for about 1/4 the cost of what was being prescribed in-house. Now, the physician formula contained other vitamins etc but many were of an inferior quality; for example, B12 in the form of cyanocobalmin rather than the better absorbed and higher quality methylcobalmin. Given the need for B12 in the eye, this was a serious consideration for us; why spend money on something that is inferior. So, we've opted to duplicate the primary substances in the physician formula with better quality supplements available online. This provide a critical piece of the puzzle and have noticed NO difference whatsoever in outcome.It does require taking a few more pills but 
B0013OX9NC I have been a fan of Jarrow Formulas Lutein for the past month. I'm in my late 30s and very near sighted.  I discovered that my eyes were not focusing correctly on objects or books at close distance.  Imagine my horror and surprise!  Of course, I knew these focussing issues were a sign of getting older, and I didn't want to just give into that truth so quickly. That is, I thought I may as well try to help my eyes out.  So I ordered Jarrow's Lutein, 20mg.  In addition, I also started a course of Bilberry supplements. I take one pill of each at dinner time.  So it's been about a month since my freak out moment of aging and my start on Lutein.  Honestly, my issues with focussing on close objects have lessened. I will continue taking Lutein, since I do think it's helping. And with the Bilberry supplement, I think I might be able to stave off bifocal lenses for a few more years.  Of course, all of my good results could just be the placebo effect, but I value my eyesight, and so I'll take it if it is. I think for the price you are paying for Jarrow Lutein, it's quite a value. Always be sure to talk to your PCP about your supplements regimen.
B0013OX9NC I'm approaching seventy years old, which is about the age that both my mom and her brother began to go blind from macular degeneration. Also, extreme nearsightedness runs in both of my parents' families, which explains why my eyesight has never been better than 20/450. I'm also diabetic (type 2, controlled), and to top it off, I'm only a year or so away from needing cataract surgery. So I take care of my eyes and see my ophthalmologist every year. Since I don't eat very much green, leafy vegetables or eggs - two natural sources of lutein and zeaxanthin - I asked my ophthalmologist about taking supplemental lutein/zeaxanthin at my most recent eye exam. He was fairly noncommittal, but he didn't reject the idea either, so I started taking an older men's multivitamin. The vitamin has only 250mcg of lutein, however, so I started looking for more potent sources. I've read a good bit on the subject, and the Jarrow formula with 20mg dosage is in line with recommendations that I've seen. The instructions on the bottle recommend taking one softgel per day with food, and that's the amount that I'm taking. I've also read that the only known side effect of excess lutein consumption is a harmless bronzing of the skin known as carotenaemia.I haven't taken the Jarrow lutein long enough to notice any obvious benefits, but I've used other Jarrow products enough to trust the brand. Being at great risk of macular degeneration and eventual blindness is a big motivator, and I feel more confident now that I'm taking the lutein/zeaxanthin supplement.
B0013OX9NC Lutein and Zeaxanthin are carotenoid antioxidants that are known to help protect the eyes against oxidative stress, thus helping prevent macular degeneration and other vision problems. These compounds are found to concentrate in the eyes as well as skin, breast, and cervical tissues. These compounds are normally obtained in the diet through green leafy vegetables, which most people don't consume much of. For supplements, marigold petal extract is used to get the concentrated doses of these antioxidants. Jarrow's softgels include soybean oil, beeswax, and mixed tocopherols inside the capsule of gelatin, glycerin, and water. The drawback here is that this isn't suitable for those seeking to avoid soy and the gelatin capsule makes it unsuitable for strict vegetarians. A vegetable-based capsule would make this vegan friendly, and I don't see why Jarrow doesn't implement that since they do have a good number of supplements that are suitable for vegans. I find this supplement to be a valuable one and the softgels are easy to consume, though I prefer to break it open to ingest what is inside without swallowing the gelatin. I'm next going to try Jarrow's Vision Optimizer formula and see if that is better - that one uses regular capsules with a variety of antioxidants and herbal compounds (Lutein and Zeanxathin plus much more) without any soybean oil.
B0013OX9NC Supplements are tricky. They are not regulated like traditional drugs and can make all sorts of claims. Take Lutein for example. It is supposed to be important for eye health and result in improved vision. But is this truly the case? And then there is the matter of psychosomatics. You think that the supplement has improved things when, in reality, it may be just your perception that things have improved. Sometimes it is our imagination that, in itself, caused the improvement. Please keep this in mind as you read my review of Jarrow Formulas Lutein.Having offered my disclosure, I can now say that I noticed an immediate improvement in my eyesight after taking Jarrow Formulas Lutein 20 mg. Not eventually, not over time, not after-a-while. Immediately.Things were fuzzy in the morning for me. I had trouble reading small fonts when I first awoke. It took my eyes several minutes, perhaps a half hour, before the haze passed out of my eyes. That was before taking Jarrow Formulas Lutein. Now I see clearly as soon as I awake.This is a truly amazing result from taking any supplement. Is it real or is it Memorex? I can't say. The improvement was rather dramatic and rather fast. I will leave it up to you to decide if this is a figment of my imagination or a real improvement due to taking Jarrow Formulas Lutein. All I can say is that the improvement was noticeable and real to me. Of course, your results may vary.
B0013OX9NC Lutein and Zeaxanthin are tiny but powerful anti-oxidants derived from the petals of marigold flowers. We have taken supplements containing these anti-oxidants over the years - my vision is sharper and more in focus today than it was in my youth.  Jarrow Formulas provides a good quality product in an easy to swallow pill in an economical formula - that's a winner in my book.Serving Size: 1 softgel daily, with food.Lutein 20mgZeaxanthin 1mgOther Ingredients: soybean oil, beeswax, mixed tocopherols (natural preservative)Softgel consists of gelatin, glycerin, water.No wheat, no gluten, no dairy, no egg, no fish/shellfish, no peanuts/tree nuts.
B0013OX9NC Do you appreciate your eyes?  Do you want to keep them healthy and maintain good vision for life?What are your options?Eat Kale every day.  Try it, you'll like it. eheheh.  It only takes about 3 hours to steam a big pot until its tender enough to eat.  Add 3 oz. of olive oil and some Season All and it's not all that bad.Take Ocuvite.  It's an expensive supplement for eye health made by Bausch & Lomb.  Check out the vitamin formulation of mainly Lutein & Zeaxanthin.I like spending less time and money and achieving the same results.Most health conscious folks take multi-vitamins and consume foods and supplements rich in Omega 3, antioxidants and perhaps A, C, E and Zinc along with soluble B vitamins.If you are so inclined, all that's necessary is to add a Lutein supplement.  Many companies sell Lutein supplements.I am not a scientist with a complete lab so I have to find a brand at a reasonable price that I trust and hope that it is not made in China and filled with lead paint.For now, I trust Jarrow Formulas, at least until I discover a reason not to.
B0013OX9NC I've taken other lutein supplements, but Jarrow Formulas is more reasonably priced than most.  The pills go down easy and contain 20mg of lutein each vs. 10-40mg for other supplements.  I honestly can't say how well it works, but supposedly it's effective in maintaining healthy eyes.  Leafy greens like kale and spinach are high in lutein.  I think you'd have to eat about half a pound of spinach to get 20mg of lutein though.
B0013OX9NC I've never taken supplements before except for occasional multi-vitamins and am not a fan of them in general, preferring instead to simply eat a healthy diet.  But as a voracious reader, I had lately noticed my eyes feeling tired and decided to give this product a try.Lutein is a chemical which is concentrated in the area of the retina which is responsible for our vision.  Some studies have shown that lutein supplementation increases the pigmentation in the macula, and may help decrease the risk of age-related eye diseases such as macular degeneration and cataracts.  Most research studies have been associated with the elderly and not supplementation among the general population, but there also do not seem to be any harmful side effects to taking it.  (The only side effect I could find to taking too much was possible bronzing of the skin, but that's probably something I could use after a long winter and with an upcoming vacation at the beach!)Lutein is found naturally in leafy green vegetables such as spinach and kale as well as the yolks of eggs, and although we generally eat pretty healthy at our house I'd have to admit it could be a little better sometimes.  The Jarrow softgels, which are just over half an inch long, get their lutein from an extract from marigold petals (one of my favorite flowers) and contain 20mg.  Other ingredients are \"soybean oil, beeswax and mixed tocopherols.\"  The recommendation is for one a day and they seemed to go better when taken with a meal.  I hesitate to mention it but it did seem my eyes felt a little less tired when I started taking these, although I honestly may have only imagined it.
B0013OX9NC I started taking \"eye vitamins\" when my mother's sight began fading due to age-related macular degeneration (abbreviated AREDS).  The key ingredient I look for is lutein.  Unfortunately, the typical eye vitamin is sized like a horse pill, and I have trouble swallowing big pills.  These are not only sized smaller, they are softgels, which means they go down easy!  I am glad I found these.
B0013OX9NC I intend to enjoy active health and my physical senses well into my later years. So I take a lot of supplements (with my doctor's okay), in recommended dosages. Lutein is one for the eyeballs. It is purported to protect vision in the macula and lens.Recommended daily amount is one softgel per day with food. The source for this pill is marigold petals, and there is 20 mg of lutein per serving. There is also Vitamin E as an oil-based carrier, which is nice.
B0013OX9NC Each serving Jarrow Lutein combines 20 mg. lutein with 1 mg. zeacanthin. In a 2007 article in JAMA (Journal of the American Medical Associatoin) Opthamology, Dr. John Paul SanGiovanni of the National Eye Institute, Maryland and colleagues discuss a six-year study that led to the conclusion that \"Study participants reporting the highest dietary intake of lutein/zeaxanthin were statistically less likely to have advanced AMD\" (Age-related Macular Degeneration, which basically means age-related blindness). In a Q&A; on AMD, Dr. Burt Dubow of Insight Eye Care in St. Cloud. MN says, \"There are eye supplements available that contain the essential elements found in dark green leafy vegetables -- primarily lutein and zeaxanthin. Taking these supplements as directed may help forestall the effects of macular degeneration.\"This is one of a number of supplements I take in hopes it will do me some good without expecting undeniable immediate effects (like when I take melatonin or valerian, for example). I get a tiny amount of lutein but no zeaxanthin in the daily \"adults 50+\" vitamin I take, so I think/hope I do well for my eyes by taking Jarrow Lutein.Jarrow Formulas is held in high regard in the natural food industry. Jarrow has won many awards from a number of journals and magazines geared toward natural food, nutrition and vitamin industry insiders. Based on my experience in the industry (I operated natural food co-ops and for-profit stores from the mid-70's into the early 90's) and my familiarity with Jarrow brand supplements (I've used and continue to use quite a few), I rank Jarrow highly among supplement brands in terms of quality and fair pricing.
B0013OX9NC Marketed to promoted eye health , Lutein softgels claim to promote macula health. My mother suffers from degradation of the macula , and this product was recommende by her eye doctor.The effects and impact won't be known for a while , but hopefully this product will stave off the deteriorization for a while.
B0013OX9NC How important is ones eyesight?  About as important as it can be!  I want my eyes to be as healthy as I can make them. Lutein helps to keep the eye healthy.  I was happy that the Amazon Vine Program had  Lutein as an option.  I will continue to buy Jarrow Lutein to help keep my eyes healthy.
B0013OX9NC On the advice of my ophthalmologist I have been using 20 mg of Lutein daily for about four years now.  This product is recommended for macula and lens health.  The bottle contains a 60 day supply of the softgel, easy to swallow capsules.  The ingredient list is:  Lutein (as esters) 20 mg, Zeaxanthin (as esters) 1 mg, soybean oil, beeswax and mixed tocopherols.  Softgel consists of gelatin, glycerin and water.  The label also notes there is no:  wheat, gluten, dairy, eggs, fish/shellfish, peanuts/tree nuts.  Notice that this product does contain soy.The only reason for the rating of four stars over five is because the product I've been using for many years does not include the soy.  Other than that the two brands appear identical.  On the other hand, the price for this product is quite a bit less than the one I'm using now.  When this 60 day supply is about to run out I will have to decide which factor will carry the most weight for re-ordering.
B0013OX9NC Many multivitamins have lutein, but I'd like to be sure I'm getting enough of this nutrient, which is believed to contribute to eye health. We have all kinds of eye issues in our family, and I'd love to avoid getting them. I have one minor issue, and will update the review after using this supplement after a while, after my next eye exam. Meanwhile, this is an easy-to-swallow softgel caplet with 20mgs of lutein per cap.
B0013OX9NC These Lutein pills literally smell like horse manure. The size of the pill is small but I have not been able to get past the smell to regularly take it. I am not a great pill taker and easily gag. Per other reviews they do seem to work.
B0013OX9NC Well, I've reached the age at which a quarter of people show signs of macular degeneration and that average certainly doesn't improve the older one gets.  Since a daily glass of red wine to prevent this eye condition has been debunked (at least for now), I'm happy to have this lutein/zeaxanthin supplement, which, although not as pleasant to ingest as the wine, is certainly better than 3 cups of collard greens. So I'm happy to have the opportunity to try this brand of the supplement.  It seems to be quite satisfactory but there's really no way for me to know if it works, except by having my eyes checked annually.  So far I've had a clean bill of eye health.
B0013OX9NC One a night for two weeks and my vision has not improved. Maybe I should have bought the combo with Billberry or whatever it's called.
B0013OX9NC I think it is impossible for me to say whether this is helping my eyes or not.  All I can say is that it has caused no problems.  I was taking one each day, but then read on WebMD that \"Even high dietary lutein intake of 6.9-11.7 mg/day appears to be safe. Lutein supplements 10 mg/day for a year have also been safely used.\" and switched to 1 every 2 days as the 20 mg in each softgel pill may be more than I need.I don't take a lot of supplements and only ordered these because WebMD said they are POSSIBLY helpful with:Age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Consuming lutein as part of the diet might help to prevent AMD, but it's not known whether taking lutein supplements works as well. There is also some information that taking lutein supplements (10 mg per day for 12 months) might help decrease symptoms of AMD, but more research is needed. Lutein supplements don't seem to keep AMD from getting worse.Reducing the risk of developing eye cataracts, when high amounts of lutein are obtained from the diet. It is not known if lutein supplements offer the same benefit.Given the low risk and possible benefit, I am glad to be taking these.
B0013OX9NC Ordered this because my doctor said I need to take it for my eyes.  I guess it works.  But I got a better deal at my local drug store.
B0013OX9NC I have nothing bad to say about Jarrow Lutein. I've found that it seems to work just as well as I would have expected, and there is no bad taste/aftertaste from the pill going down. It's easy to swallow, and the Jarrow brand seems reasonably priced (not the cheapest, but right about in the middle of the pack). As far as effectiveness, I've only been using it a few weeks now and I'm not going to say I've seen a drastic improvement in my eye health or vision, but I have no complaints and certainly haven't experienced anything bad from using it. Overall I can recommend this product as a seemingly solid Lutein supplement.
B0013OX9NC My ophthalmologist recommended that I take lutein for my eyesight. As I grow older my eyesight gets progressively worse. Lutein is meant to support good cell growth and slow the effects of aging on the eyes.  I hope it works but just using it for a short time so far it's impossible to tell. I can say that the pill is small and easy to swallow and I've had no side effects.
B0013OX9NC Eyes need lutein, an antioxidant compound found in tomatoes and other vegetables.  So enjoy tomatoes in your salads -- except that tomatoes grown in poor soil and under less than optimal conditions may not have enough lutein to do the job.  That's when a supplement such as this by Jarrow can help.  The fact that a small amount of zeaxanthin is also included is a bonus to protect your eyes.I've been using Jarrow supplements for about a year, and have found them to be helpful and have also found that their lists of ingredients appear to be accurate representations of what's actually in their capsules. I recommend considering products from Jarrow before going to those of other companies.
B0013OX9NC Macular Degeneration runs in my family so my doctor recommended that I take Lutein supplements to try to avoid the same issues.  These are very easy to take with no bad odors or unpleasant aftertaste.  They are not too big to swallow and do not cause any side effects.  I have found Jarrow to be a reputable manufacturer of supplements and their prices are usually quite fair.  Quality is consistent and superior to many higher cost brands.
B0013OX9NC I'll say right off the bat: I don't notice much, if any, difference by taking these. But I do trust the research, which says that lutein is very good for your eyes. So I take them regularly. I haven't noticed any adverse effects, and perhaps over time they will have a positive effect on my eyes.
B0013OX9NC I've used the Jarrow Vision Optimizer that boasts more ingredients:- Vitamin C, E, niacinamide, B1, B2, B6, Selenium, Taurine, Quercetin, Blackcurrant Extract, Alpha Lipoic Acid, Gamma Tocopherol, Grape Seed Extract, Eyebright, Ginkgo Biloba, Lutein, Zeaxanthin.It might appear that the Vision Optimizer is better than this one (the Lutein and Zeaxanthin), but oh, there's something to consider before letting judgement fall.  The Vision Optimizer capsules are big and harder to swallow, and the serving size is 3 of the capsules per day!Also, the Vision Optimizer has only 10mg of Lutein and 2 mg of Zeaxanthin.This Jarrow Formula, has 20mg of Lutein and 1mg of Zeaxanthin and the capsules are much easier to swallow and the service size is only one.So, if you need more Lutein, this is the one. If you don't like large capsules, this is the one.If you want a more comprehensive protocol, the vision optimizer has a wider range of ingredients that are believed to help the eyes in many ways.
B0013OX9NC This Lutein supplement is a great addition to a healthy diet: taken once a day with water, this is helpful for improvements in skin, eyes, and other tissues...decent price, good product, would recommend!
B0013OX9NC When I take this Jarrow Formulas Lutein.  I can see better and my vision got clear.  When I forgot to take it one day or two...my vision get blurry....Then I took it and got clear in few hours.  I guess Lutein is very essential for our retina.
B0013OX9NC These  are easy to take with no unpleasant taste or aftertaste.  I believe that Lutein helps eye health - the evidence is pretty overhwelming.After 2 weeks, I haven't personally experience any improvement in my eyestrain/blurriness.  I was hoping for some improvement to the blurriness that sets in after I've been staring at a computer screen for too long.So maybe 3 stars for Lutein, but 5 stars for this supplement if you already know that Lutein does work for you.I will continue to take these because I believe the medical literature that it's good for my eyes, even if not for the specific blurriness issue.
B0013OX9NC It is a small palatable pill and rather easy to take.  As for whether it is useful for my eyes, I could assume Lutein is good and hope that this is working.  I doubt that the effect could be felt in a short period of time. I will give this a try and see if I can see better.
B0013OX9NC My eye guy recommended that I take Lutein, and use a supplement that has at lease 10 mg of Lutein. This has twice that, plus you get 60 softgels. Plus it's under $10, so it's less expensive and has twice the active ingredient than other brands. It's also a small softgel, so is easy to swallow.
B0013OX9NC From time to time, I have taken supplements to help my vision.  I want to try to prevent my eyesight from getting any worse so I am open to trying what the FDA doesn't want you to know it works.  A few months ago my eyes would get tried after the long work days so I was thinking of getting something for my eyes again as I do not want to get a new pair of glasses yet.  I tried these and my vision is doing well, even after a long day.  While I cannot say these helped for certain, I am glad my eyes are doing a little better.
B0013OX9NC My relatives have serious vision issues as they age including glaucoma & macular degeneration. My own eye exams include the higher $ retinal imaging record as a preventative detection measure. Since lutein has been in my regimen for yours, the retinal images have been unchanged for the good or diagnosed as better.Improved absorption of lutein through more current technology is all good.
B0013OX9NC I'm in my 40's and I work on the computer for hours and hours.Recently, my eyes started getting terribly tired in the evening.  It was hard to focus and my night vision while driving seemed to be compromised.  I had an eye exam and my doctor said my eyes were in great shape.  He said some of his other patients were taking Lutien and why not give it a try...Well, I've been taking Lutein for several weeks and it HAS helped!  My focusing is better and things are so much less blurry towards the end of the day.  At night, my eyes are much less tired.  I am surprised and happy to have such a great response.  Placebo?  Maybe.  But, I'm not stopping these to test it out.  They have really made a big difference for me and I'm very pleased to be able to see more clearly and with less strain.
B0013OX9NC I did my homework when I decided on adding a Lutein supplement. I've been taking Jarrow's Lutein formula for over a year now. And I can tell that it helps my eyes because they get worse when I forget to take it! I trust this brand for purity - something you have to check out with vitamin companies.Important: The softgel has a great shape that goes down easy with no aftertaste.Take it and be healthy!
B0013OX9NC I tried these because they worked for my Dad. He swears they help with his near sightedness. So far I have not seen a change in my own vision or eye health though. Fortunately, I have not experienced any side effects from these either. Since they are easy to swallow and cause no ill effects, I'm going to try them for another month or two to determine if this is the type of supplement that must be taken for awhile before having an effect. Also, my ophthalmologist recommends this supplement.
B0013OX9NC i take lutein for eye health- jarrow is a good brand that i trust.  this lutein was at a good price and i believe it is a quality product.
B0013OX9NC Population studies link low levels of lutein and Zeaxanthin to higher incidence of macular degeneration. But the proof of lutein and Zeaxanthin supplements preventing macular degeneration is weak. Since you have only one life, and there are no other means with solid evidence to prevent macular degeneration, I would take these supplements if there is a family history of macular degeneration.Supplement industry, with its powerful lobbying, has managed to prevent its regulation by FDA and so I am always leary of taking supplements and when I do, I only stick to well known brands like Meijer, Costco, Walmart, etc trusting that they have interest in the quality control of what they put on their shelves.Jarrow makes lot of supplements and there is no way for me to personally determine the quality and purity of their supplements. Meijer brand of Lutein has 25 mg lutein and 5 mg of Zeaxanthin compared to 20 mg and 1 mg respectively in Jarrow brand, which as of the date of this review, is half the price per softgel compared with Meijer brand. Jarrow has 60 softgels per bottle (15 cents/softgel) compared to Meijer's 30 per bottle.So if cost is a priority, then this is a good deal. But quality is unknown. On Jarrow web site, I saw no proof of their quality control.
B0013OX9NC Lutein has numerous benefits for your vision. These softgels are the best around in price per mg and a way better bargain that what you will find in Wal-Mart or drug stores. If you're in the market for lutein this is a good option.
B0013OX9NC If you read the information on the bottle this supplement comes in, it tells you that it is not designed to cure, treat, or prevent any disease, though it does talk about how its active ingredient supports tissue in the eye, uterus and other areas. When you decide to start taking any supplement, it's important to know that you are essentially gambling your money on a potential benefit rather than receiving a guarantee. Chances are you can never know if taking such a supplement will assist in health maintenance. My feeling is that, if you are at substantial risk of diseases associated with the tissues such supplements are supposed to support, it may not be a bad gamble to take them. This is why I obtained this supplement.My family has a history of uterine and cervical cancer as well as cataracts. Though I do eat a well-balanced diet which includes food rich in Lutein (broccoli, spinach, eggs with yolks), I figure that with my family's history, a little extra can't hurt and might help. At a price of $9 for nearly a two month supply, this is a pretty economical supplement and it is easy to take. The gel caps are moderate in size and can be taken with food.No one can promise that any supplement is going to perform in a particular way for you, but if you have a family history of any of the problems Lutein might assist the prevention of (macular degeneration, cataracts, etc.) and especially if your diet is lacking, this may be a good option as a supplement for you.
B0013OX9NC I have to admit, I prefer Jarrow products over other brands. They're of excellent quality at a reasonable price, making them one of the best values in nutritional supplements around. The 20mg Lutein softgels are easy to swallow and don't have any odd odors or lingering flavors. They're easy to take and don't upset my somewhat sensitive stomach, even if taken on an empty stomach. If you're looking for a Lutein supplement to help keep your eyes healthy, Jarrow Formulas comes highly recommended.
B0013OX9NC I like the convenience and price of having these Lutein auto-shipped every other month. I take one daily for eye health but found remembering to get them and finding a reasonably price 20mg formula a hassle. Very happy with having them automatically show up every sixty days and getting a discounted price is great.
B0013OX9NC This spring I have been suffering with seasonal allergies that have been worse than usual, especially with my eyes being watery. After a bout this year with a horrible sinus infection brought on by allergies, that even after antibiotics hasn't completely went away, I've been taking vitamins more. Since my own personal diet lacks in the area of not enough dark, green and leafy vegetables and I have a job that keeps me indoors over 12 hours a day, vitamin therapy has been helping.After just one week of taking this Lutein once a day, I can tell the difference in my eyesight and the noticeably reduction in eye watering and eye fatigue.These vitamins are not hard to take for me, and usually I have trouble swallowing pills. They have almost like a softcoat on them which makes them easier to take.Overall, I'd highly recommend these to maintain the health of your eyes, especially if your diet lacks in green, leafy vegetables.
B0013OX9NC If age-related macular degeneration (AMD) runs in your family, especially late onset AMD, please consider this supplement.I first heard about it in various AMD publications years ago, that I poured over when a dear friend became legally blind due to it.Studies have shown that it to be beneficial, so many studies that there was a study to study the studies!!! If memory serves, it was the University of Beijing, but I could be wrong. In any case, the data from a number of studies was examined, along with carefully analyzing if the study has valid data, and it determined that there was a significant benefit for AMD.A minimum of 6-10 mg per day of lutein is suggested, I've been dropping a Jarrow softgel 20mg in a Vitamix smoothie that I share with my spouse.If you don't like kale, which has one of the highest concentrations per serving of Luiein and zeaxanthin, please consider a supplement.
B0013OX9NC I really like this brand, the bonus is also that the pill is small to take and easy to swallow. After taking these for 2 weeks, I have not noticed a difference. Not sure if I need to take the whole bottle? It can't be harmful so I will keep taking, and possibly order another hoping to see improvement.
B0013OX9NC The product is excellent for eye health. Lutein and Zexanthin is great for promoting eye health. So, this is a good source for those two important vitamins.But, I wished I had read the ingredients list closer, because this product DOES contain soy. If you have a sensitivity to soy, like I do, then you'll want to avoid this product.
B0013OX9NC There is no improved vision here, but after a few days, eyes are significantly less tired after lots of computer time, so it is enough benefit for me. Will keep buying for sure.
B0013OX9NC My Dad has emasculate degeneration (hope I spelled that right) and so I am concerned about inheriting that gene.  Figured after seeing this on Dr. Oz to give it a try and after two weeks noticed a big improvement in the clarity of my vision.  I'd definitely recommend this produce.
B0013OX9NC I have no complaints about this product. The capsules are easy to swallow, and I've had no adverse effects from taking them. But neither have I noticed any positive effects attributable to taking the supplement.When I try a new supplement, I like to have a specific goal in mind. Dry eyes have become a serious problem for me, and I'd heard that lutein supplements could help alleviate the problem. I've been taking this product for about a month now, and so far, no luck with relieving dry eyes. I'll keep taking it till the bottle is gone, but I'm not likely to purchase more.With nutritional supplements that promise to prevent future problems, you just have to take it on faith that you're reaping the benefits. There seems to be a lot of well-documented literature about the benefits of lutein and zeaxanthin to promote eye health and prevent macular degeneration. All I know for sure is that it doesn't help with dry eyes.If you've studied the claims and you believe lutein will help you, this product is likely to be satisfactory for you. The only exception would be if you're averse to using a product with soybean oil that is not specified as non-GMO.
B0013OX9NC I am doubtful of a lot of supplements that state they do this or that, especially when the company can't back up their claims with scientific proof.  Lutein supplements are the real deal.  Twelve years ago I got Lasik eye surgery; my eyesight was 20/200 in one eye; 20/400 in the other.  Lasik perfected my vision to 20/20.  I've been taking Lutein ever since and my eyesight has remained perfect, at age 62.  Of course, I can't claim Lutein was solely responsible, but I think it had a lot to do with this.  I like this particular brand because you only have to take one softgel that's easy to swallow once a day.  I received this product courtesy of Amazon Vine.
B0013OX9NC After having a bad experience with the new age fad of sungazing, I found lutein to be effective in getting my vision back to normal. Beforehand, I was starting to have trouble reading bookprint of whatever size for any length of time. Thanks to lutein, my vision has improved so it is not blurry anymore. Jarrow makes a quality form of lutein.
B0013OX9NC We use a zeaxathin product from Life ExtensionLife Extension Super Zeaxanthin with Lutein and Meso Zeaxanthin Plus Astaxanthin and C3g, 60 Softgel,as a part of a health program for vision support, so I thought I'd give the Jarrow Brand a try since it was available to us to try as a part of the Amazon Vine program.I like Jarrow Formulas, as I tend to do well with this brand because of the purity. This product has:No wheat, no gluten, no dairy, no egg, no fish/shellfish, no peanuts/tree nuts. It does contain soy.While it's a good product, after comparing the ingredients with the Life Extension Zeaxanthin, we plan to stick with the Life Extension product. It's got a greater concentration of zeaxanthin from two different sources, a greater concentration of lutein, and C3G that helps support night vision.So this one is fine, but not our first choice.
B0013OX9NC I don't think you can go wrong with Jarrow.If they offer a supplement, it works as described.I have tried many (20+) Jarrow products and I have yet to be disappointed.Give Jarrow a try.This supplement really works.Jarrow formulas are worth it.They come from top quality sources and they are and work exactly as described.
B0013OX9NC I take various supplements every day, and this is one of them. Based on research studies, which I summarize below, I added lutein to my plan. Lutein ia a naturally occurring carotenoid. It is found in green leafy vegetables such as spinach and kale, and also in eggs and animal fat. Lutein is utilized by our bodies as an antioxidant and for blue light absorption.It potentially helps protect our eyes from damage caused by unstable atoms known as free radicals, which can interact with and break down healthy tissue. Lutein may also help to protect our eyes by filtering high-energy blue light. By filtering blue light, the pigment protects underlying cell layers from potential light damage.Also, oral or topical lutein improves skin hydration, elasticity and lipid content.Other research has found lutein can inhibit the thickening of the walls of carotid arteries and LDL-induced plaque on human artery cell walls. Therefore, it is suggested that lutein has strong cardivascular properties.One of the largest case-controlled studies has shown that high intake of lutein from fruits and vegetables significantly reduces the risk of melanoma. Scientists believe these xanthophyll carotenoids prevent melanoma by protecting the skin against sun damage. Korean researchers have found that carotenoids such as lutein and can reduce colon cancer growths. It is currently being studied for breast cancer inhibition.
B0013OX9NC I am not one to believe all the hype about something, and while I wholeheartedly believe in natural foods and  proper supplements made from beneficial botanicals, I know they take time to work. This is why I am in disbelief about how quickly the Jarrow Lutein worked! I (for the last year or so) have used magnified readers when using the computer for long hours, or reading smaller fonts in books or in poorly lit situations. I resigned myself to this new, middle-aged need, begrudgingly.Was I surprised, when in less than a week of use, I did not need to put my glasses on to work. I remembered to get them out of my desk drawer (habit) and never remembered to put them on because I just started working at the computer. No strain, no headache, after hours and hours!
B0013OX9NC I've started taking eye vitamins, even though I'm not sure if they are truly beneficial or not.  I am assuming they are, and these Jarrow ones are very easy to swallow and are nicely priced.  Eye vitamins in the grocery store and drug store cost a lot more.  In fact, they are some of the most expensive vitamins out there!
B0013OX9NC At the insistence of my mother, who began taking Ocuvite about 8 yearsago and has excellent eye health in spite of a family history ofcataracts, I recently started taking eye supplements. Initially I wasput off by the cost of Ocuvite, especially since it only had 5mgLutein and 1 mg Zeaxanthin, plus contained other supplements (like VitA & C) that I was already getting. Instead, I started with a storebrand combination gel tab - Simply Right's Lutein 25mg & Zeaxanthin5mg.I'm glad that I had an opportunity to try this Jarrow brand as part ofthe Amazon Vine program, but I plan to go back to my store brand assoon as this bottle is finished. There are a few reasons:(1) PRICE. I get more for my money with the store brand. My storebrand has 120 gel tabs per bottle and costs less than 60 gel tabbottle of this Jarrow brand. Moreover, my store brand contains 25 mgLutein and 5 mg Zeaxanthin, whereas this Jarrow brand contains less ofboth - 20 mg Lutein and 1 mg Zeaxanthin.(2) GEL TABLET SIZE. My store brand's tabs are smaller. This actuallywas a surprise, since there are less active ingredients (mg's) in theJarrow brand. This leads me to suspect that the Jarrow brand containsmore filler & suspension oil. In addition, the Jarrow brand usessoybean oil, which I have been advised to avoid.(3) RATIO OF LUTEIN TO ZEAXANTHIN. My store brand has a lower ratio ofLutein to Zeaxanthin. Lutein & Zeaxanthin appear together in natureand are used in combination in eye supplements. Ocuvite and my storebrand have a 5:1 ratio, whereas this Jarrow brand has a 20:1 ratio.Although higher ratios occur in nature, many eye specialists arerecommend lower ratios in supplements.(4) AMOUNT OF LUTEIN & ZEAXANTHIN. My store brand has more Lutein andZeaxanthin per tab. Zeaxanthin is especially important for the centerof the the macula. As a result, many recommend higher levels ofZeaxanthin. For instance, the American Optometric Association recentlyreported on scientific evidence that suggests 2mg of Zeaxanthin dailyis needed for eye health. This Jarrow brand has only 1mg ofZeaxanthin, and my daily diet does contain the other 1mg.For all these reasons, the Jarrow brand of this supplement is gettinga middle rating from me, and I am going back to my store brand whenthis bottle is finished. I tried it, and I have no reason to doubtthat it's doing what it's supposed. Based on the research I've done, Icertainly don't think it's the best supplement on the market. However,I also don't think it is the worst. Not taking anything, for instance,would be worse.The American diet is deficient in Lutein and Zeaxanthin, so it isimportant to care for our eyes and to supplement our diet asnecessary. However, I'd encourage everyone to do their own research bycomparing ingredients and prices, even seeking out the advice of aphysician, before committing to a particular brand for the long-term.Moreover, shoppers also should also be aware what eye supplements areintended to do. Specifically, Lutein & Zeaxanthin will not restorelost vision, change visual acuity, or correct dry eyes. Instead,Lutein & Zeaxanthin help protect against eye disease, includingmacular degeneration and cataracts. There are excellent medicalresources available at Web MD and the American Optometric Association.Do your own research. Talk to your doctor.
B0013OX9NC My husband and I have been taking Jarrow's Lutein for the last several weeks.  These softgels contain 20 mgs of Lutein and 1 mg of Zeaxanthin.  The floaters my husbands has in his eyes seem to be getting better.  In terms of protecting the macula I assume this is a product that needs to be taken long term to prevent macular degeneration as an older adult.  The cost if used daily  (as sold by Amazon) is $.15 per pill.  Bausch and Lomb advertises a Lutein/Zexanthin/Omega-3 version of Occuvite on television though I have not yet been able to find that triple supplement combination online.  This product is easy to swallow and has no aftertaste or other ill effects at least in our family.
B0013OX9NC My husband has been taking Lutein for years now since finding out it was supposed to be good for eye health.  He is very near sighted and had a detached retina in one eye, so he does anything he can do to keep his vision from getting worse.  He normally takes 40mg a day, so this bottle of 20mg, 60 softgels will last him a couple weeks.I don't believe that this product is something that will improve vision short-term; it needs to be taken continually.  With age, lutein in the eye diminishes and need to be replenished.Jarrow Forumulas seems to be a good product and the price seems good, especially with the subscribe and save.
B0013OX9NC Lutein (and Zeaxanthin) are medically known and with much evidence shown to reduce the risk of AMD (Age-related Muscular Degeneration) and cataract.Due to this reason, I have been keeping my daily intake of vegetables (with Lutein) at about 10-20 mg per day. This has also been a recommended intake for both eye and health benefits as Lutein is a powerful anti-oxidant.However, when we travel, vegetables tend to be a neglected dish and we are glad that with the Jarrow Formulas Lutein softgels, we are able to supplement it to our diet.The pill is medium-sized, has a slight odor and is easy to swallow. One pill carries 20mg Lutein and 1mg Zeaxanthin. A good product to bring during travels or as regular intake to supplement a high protein/low veggie diet.
B0013OX9NC For the last year and a half, I've been concentrating on doing everything I can to prevent my eyesight from deteriorating further. Lutein with Zeaxanthin is one of the basic components of my plan. Although I also take other products, I alternate the rest from day to day. Lutein is the only one I take everyday and I credit the majority of my improvement to this product.The Jarrow formula has the same proportion of the two ingredients that is found in nature when everything is working right. It is a small, easy to swallow capsule, no smell, no aftertaste, and it works. It is also safe, no side effects at even more than this concentration, and no drug interactions.I am obviously doing something right. In the 18-month period, I've had three sets of eyeglasses: the ones I had before I had to start taking prednisone every day. My eyesight was noticeably affected pretty soon after starting and the eyeglass prescription that had been almost unchanged for years became almost useless. I had to get new ones made that were a much stronger prescription. After my latest checkup, those were too strong, and I am almost (not quite, but close) to my old prescription.In addition to this Lutein/Zeaxanthin product, I also take bilberry, choline (a B vitamin) and, twice a week, beta carotene and the AREDS formula. (Note: the last two I take with restraint because both vitamins A & E can have side effects in excess and I'm uncomfortable taking 500% or more of something on a daily basis).My eyesight has, not only not deteriorated further, which was what I'd hoped for, it is almost back to where it was before. I am very happy and relieved, and I am going to continue doing exactly what I've been doing.
B0013OX9NC I was diagnosed with macular degeneration several years ago. I immediately started taking lutein (from various providers) and it seems to me there's been no significant deterioration in my eyesight, which leads me to believe it is beneficial. Of course, this is all so subjective. There's absolutely no way for me to know this definitively.The Jarrow Lutein compares favorably with other brands I've taken, and the price is comparable to what I usually purchase from Sam's Club or Costco.
B0013OX9NC The softgels, to me, are easy to swallow.  This product contains 20 mg of Lutein, which is more than some of the other brands, but also less than some.  Be sure to read the labels before making your purchase to find out the desired milligrams vs. price.
B0013OX9NC Almost ten years ago, my father lost his vision to Rapid, Wet Macular Degeneration.  He did all the right things.  He went to the best Ophthalmologists in our area.  But, unfortunately, he was one of the small percentage of people whose progression can not be stopped, even with the right treatment.  I learned through his diagnosis and treatment that Macular Degeneration is highly genetic.  Even though I was only about 40-years-old at the time, I started to take a much more educated and pro-active role in my eye care.  My own Ophthalmologist recommended that I begin taking supplements which contain Lutein to support my eye health.  For the past ten years, I have been taking a well-known eye care supplement brand; but I have always been bothered by the fact it contains other supplements which I already take for other conditions.  I have always felt I was taking more of certain supplements than I could ever benefit from.  Then, I found Jarrow Formulas Lutein.  It contains only the supplement I really need for my eye care, and not other supplements which I am already taking in other forms.  This is just what I have been looking for!  Thank you, Jarrow Formulas!
B0013OX9NC We tried the Jarrow Lutein 20mg, and there it is a fine quality product. Jarrow is known for its quality ingredients. The reason we aren't giving this 5 stars is that the increased dosage doesn't seem worth it. We normally take a lower dose (and therefore less expensive) and there is no noticeable difference in taking these. So I'd be hard pressed to say: \"spend extra for the higher dose\". But if you are new to Lutein, and can find these at a good price, by all means use them.
B0013OX9NC I have used several and still use Jarrow products. I seem to have had an allergic reaction to the Jarrow Formulas Lutein. This product is made from Marigold petals. My reaction was tightness in the lungs, small hives on my neck and swollen and sore joints in my hands after taking the recommended dosage for 4 days. I am not going to be too quick to blame this product, but every indication leads me to the Lutein. It could have been coincidence, some other external cause or this product. I take several vitamins, minerals and other food supplements including some from Jarrow. I have never had a problem with them and have taken them for from 3 months to several years. All things seemed to be the same except the addition of Lutein. I stopped taking the Lutein after 4 days, and 2 days later all symptoms were gone. Since everyone has different reactions to the same foods, etc. each must judge for oneself.
B0013OX9NC After my left retina detached I learned about vitamins that promote good eye health. Lutein is perhaps the most important. We have used Jarrow before for other supplements and trust the brand. I am hoping to prevent a future detachment by taking lutein daily.
B0013OX9NC I have been reading a lot about Lutein supplementation and have been interested in trying it for a long time. My sensitive stomach issues, however, always prohibited my decision to purchase.  I have been pleasantly surprised by these softgels.  I do not experience an upset stomach or heartburn as I have with many other supplements.  This is a very big deal to me.I believe it will take quite a while to fully realize the potential benefit of taking Lutein, but I'm willing to stick with these Jarrow softgels over the long haul. (Subscribe and Save is definitely the way to go.) The company has an excellent reputation and wide range of products, though the brand has proven impossible to find in stores - at least in my area.Like all supplements, some will notice a difference and some will not. (You can say the same with a lot of prescriptive meds as well.) Overall health, lifestyle choices (activity level, nutrition, etc.), age, and compliance with suggested daily use will all play a role the outcome.
B0013OX9NC Approaching age 60, and suffering from common deteriorating eye performance, this supplement is right up my alley.  After a little over a week, I think I am already seeing some improvement in reading performance and night vision.  The long term benefit is pretty widely accepted on this stuff.The lutein in the Jarrow Formulas supplement is extracted from marigold petals, and purportedly supplements the body as an antioxidant, acting in much the same manner as spinach (an excellent vegetable choice).  Lutein specifically combats aging and degeneration of the macula (delicate light/color sensing area in the rear wall of the eye).  As a general tissue health enhancer, lutein is also believed to enhance cardio and skin health and complex tissues such as cervical and breast tissue.Each medium size and easy to swallow Jarrow's softgel contains 20mg lutein.  Recommended dosage, one per day.Contains no gluten, nuts, dairy, shellfish.  Interestingly . . . I have gotten used to always seeing a boilerplate warning on Jarrow Formulas supplements containers warning pregnant women, people under medication, etc.  However, there is no warning of any kind on this container.Jarrow has an excellent reputation.  Lutein has widely recognized benefit and this deserves to be a key item on my vitamin shelf.
B0013OX9NC In just 3 days I saw an improvement in my eyesight.  It also helped my dry eye syndrome.  Good purchase, and I have recommended it to a friend of mine for her eye problems.
B0013OX9NC Lutein is one of those supplements which can't be accurately quantified in an informal way since it's a preventive nutrient. The claims for it suggest that it maintains eye health and promotes good cell regulation.  Thus, if you don't get cancer or suffer macular or retinal issues while taking it, it might be the lutein and then again it might be that you just aren't getting any of those things. Bottom line here is that anyone with a health problem that might lead to one of the things that lutein is supposed to prevent, might want to consider taking a lutein supplement.  I take it because I'm diabetic and eye health is a real issue for us.The Jarrow formula contains about twice the recommended dosage of lutein, and while up to about 11.5 mg a day is generally thought to be safe, I'm taking a capsule every other day to be on the safe side.  More isn't always better, particularly when you're dealing with a nutrient that's not water soluble. To risk being indelicate, you'll pee out any water soluble nutrients your body doesn't use.  You'll store the fat soluble ones and they can build up, which is why being cautious with dosages of vitamins A, D, E, and K is so important.
B0013OX9NC Sometmes when I'm tired or working late my vision gets kind of blurry, taking 1 or 2 of these almost immediately clears my vision a bit. Though I dont have any profound clinical vision prolem, I can't help but think this can also be a prophylactic
B0013OX9NC I've noticed that Vitamin A has a positive impact on my skin, so I was eager to give Lutein a try because, as they say, it's like a super vitamin A.To better test the results, I temporarily cut out my usual intake of Vitamin A supplements to see if the Lutein would do even better or worse. For two weeks I took the recommended dose of 1 capsule per day (with a meal). I did not see any improvements, although I did not see any negative reaction either. The capsules swallowed easily and my body gave no upset complaints to the supplement.After the two weeks, I decided to see if taking two capsules per day would make any difference. It did not, that I could see. No noticeable skin improvements and no upset stomach or reaction.Unfortunately my eyesight is already great, so I wasn't able to monitor any potential effects it may have on the eyes (which is its main benefit, as they say).Overall, I deem it about as good as Vitamin A in regards to supplements that improve the tone and texture of skin. Although I didn't notice any miracles, having stopped taking my usual A supplement, I believe I would have noticed a negative reaction if the Lutein was less effective than A, so I believe it was doing something. Since the price is great and Jarrow is a trust-worthy company (one of my favorites), I feel these supplements deserve a positive rating.
B0013OX9NC I have tried to rotate a lot of these Jarrow products, because my kitchen drawer looks like a drugstore.  I have just begun taking these and I haven't seen a difference in my vision. My eyes are ok in the morning and I only use glasses for driving and at night when my eyes are tried and can't focus.  We will see if these pills help me as I take them.
B0013OX9NC This formula has excellent amount of Lutein, 20mg, and price is very good, about 1/2 the price for same formula of 'brand name' in CVS.  Please take with food as softgels are fat-soluble.  I already take a lot of different vitamins a day, and was glad this addition is just one small softgel.
B0013OX9NC Jarrow Formulas Lutein 20mgAmerican Optometric Association says there is no recommended daily intake for lutein and zeaxanthin, most recent studies show a health benefit for lutein supplementation at 10 mg/day and leaxanthin supplementation at 2 mg/day.Lutein (LOO-teen) and zeaxanthin are important nutrients found in green leafy vegetables as well as other foods such as eggs. Many studies have shown that lutein and zeaxanthin reduce the risk of chronic eye diseases, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and cataracts.AMD and cataract incidence are growing. Worldwide, more than 25 million people are affected by age-related macular degeneration and the formation of cataracts. AMD is the leading cause of blindness in people over age 55 in the Western world and the incidence is expected to triple by 2025.This is captured from the American Optometric Association website.  I wasn't sure how to rate something like this as how do you know that it is working unless you conduct a double blind study with statistically viable numbers over a decade.  Since I don't have a decade or population to conduct such study, I am dependent on my own research.  My ophthalmologist has recommended taking Lutein.  This product provides that at a reasonable price of $9.99 at Amazon.  The star rating is based on value for the money, it does NOT say this will work or is working since I have no way to prove that.  However considering the consequences of blindness, I will take whatever steps necessary to possibly prevent it.
B0013OX9NC After a 23andMe genetics test indicated an increased possibility of developing macular degeneration, my ophthalmologist suggested that I add a zeaxanthin supplement to my diet.Will it help?  Beats me...and one person's experience is hardly definitive.  But as long as it doesn't cause any unpleasant side effects (and I haven't had any), I don't see any downside, especially when the upside is some protection against MD.
B0013OX9NC Jarrow Formulas Lutein 20mg are an excellent source of Lutein and Zeaxanthin. As we age, our eyesight diminishes and isn't what it used to be. The combination of ingredients in this product are formulated to help improve and sustain the eyesight and eye health as we age.Knowing what I've witnessed many relatives go through all sorts of diminished vision and other eye problems as they aged, I'm determined to do what I can to avoid as many of the same problems as best as I can.I want to live as long as possible and have the eyesight to enjoy watching it all happen around me!
B0013OX9NC The \"typical\" American diet is deficient in many compounds. We don't eat enough veggies and we miss out on a lot of the good foods necessary to keep our bodies running at optimal health. Lutein is one compound sorely missed by many, unless you are a big salad eater. My eyes are already pretty bad (most likely from a childhood of eating crap) and I don't want them getting any worse. I plan to incorporate this into my busy (and sometimes veggie deficient) lifestyle.
B0013OX9NC After eye surgery I have had trouble with halos around lights. The doctor said it would probably take 6 months to have them go away, if then. I started taking this supplement and in less than a month the halos are hardly there. I will continue to take the 1 recommended capsule a day and hopefully it will continue to work.The ingredients in here are some of the same that are in green leafy vegetables which also help vision, so evidently this will add to any natural foods you are taking to improve your health.
B0013OX9NC After reading so much about Lutein and its Properties I decided to get \"Jarrow Formulas Lutein 20mg, 60 Softgels\" Lutein Supplements are use to Treat or Prevent Eye Diseases, such as Cataracts and Macular Degeneration known to be build up in the Retina and Lens of the Eye, Lutein is thought to Protect the Eye from Injury induced by Free Radicals. Even though I only been taking it for just a month I know I can see everything a little Brighter...Really! I was Amazed how Bright and Crisp Clear I can see everything, you get results within 3 Weeks, to the Point that I got Lutein Capsules for my Entire Family. I was surprised by the Size of the Softgels, they are a little Big for my Taste, but easy to Swallow. To increase your Lutein intake without the use of Lutein Supplements, include Lutein-Rich Foods like Kale, Spinach, Cabbage, Green Beans, Mangoes, and Papayas in your daily Diet. I like taking Lutein which is part of my daily routine intake Recommended!... Thank You D.D.
B0013OX9NC In today's world, bombarded as we are with UV, pollution and etc, not to mention living longer, eye health is important. Lutein has been shown to be a effective tool for vision health. Jarrow is one of the most respected brands in the business. This is also a pretty good price and easy to take, with no nasty \"vitamin burps' afterwards.\"Looks like\" you'll want to get some, then.
B0013OX9NC I had to give up wearing contacts 10 years ago (even the brands made for dry eyes). A year or so ago I started taking a more expensive brand of lutein and it made a pronounced difference in eye dryness, so I could again wear contacts on a limited basis. I've been taking the Jarrow Lutein for 6 weeks and it seems to be working just as well.
B0013OX9NC This little softgel is about the size of a navy bean and it smooth and easy to swallow. The inside ingredients contain marigold petal extracts, Lutein and Zeaxanthin. The softgel shell is made of gelatin, glycerin and water. Even though there is no wheat, gluten, dairy, egg , fish/shellfish or peanuts/tree nuts, this is not a vegan product because of the gelatin. It is said to be good for the Macula of the eye and to support visual function. I hope it works, as I had a hard time reading the micro small print on the label. Take one a day with food.
B0013OX9XW Natto is a great source of vitamin K which improves circulation and promotes healing. As someone who rock climbs and gets minor injures fairly often, I find the ability of my blood to clot a priority. whether it's a placebo effect or not, I have noticed that cuts heal faster and it's easier to stop the blood after injuries.As with all vitamins, try it out, what do you have to lose? The possibility of a benefit that's proven to work for others (such as myself) is worth your personal investigation.
B0013OX9XW In many ways Nattokinase is the roto-rooter of the circulatory system. Derived from natto, a fermented soybean dish popular in Japan, it is reputed to have clot dissolving functions.  Additionally, it is believed to support the circulatory health.My mother had a stroke and that type of condition runs in her side of the family. Although to date, I am free of those issues, I thought this might be a good preventative. The capsules are small and easy to swallow with no discernible taste or smell. I have experienced no side effects from taking the recommended one a day. Much harder to assess is whether or not I have been enjoying any benefits. Good health is usually taken for granted. But seeing the results of circulatory problems and clots in others, taking these capsules seem a small price to pay to avoid those undesirable consequences.Obviously, these should not be used it you are on any type of blood thinning medication. But this seems to be an easy and natural way for people with a predisposition to clotting and other circulatory issues to maintain health and viability.
B0013OX9XW So far from what I have experienced is Jarrow's products are consitent.Jarrow Formulas NattoMax, 100 mg, 30 CountJarrow Formulas NattoMax is a highly purified Nattokinase with vitamin K removed. Nattokinase is naturally occurring in traditional Japanese food (natto) fermented by Bacillus subtilus natto.NattoMax is concentrated without solvents. Each capsule offers 2,000 Fibrinolytic Units. Nattokinase is a fibrinolytic enzyme that supports healthy circulation by its effects on serine protease-mediated digestion of fibrin.*Its hard to tell super fast because vitamins are vitamins. These seem correct and honorable.
B0013OX9XW Natto is attributed to help reduce blot clotting.  As with any supplement, please seek the advice of your health care provider before taking anything.  Jarrow Formulas, who makes this product, advises that anyone taking blood-thinning products avoid this product.NattoMax contains 100 mg of natto extract.  Other ingredients are cellulose and magnesium stearate.  The capsule is made of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose.  The natto is extracted without the use of solvents.The product contains no wheat, gluten, dairy, soybeans, egg, fish, shellfish, peanuts or tree nuts, and is suitable for vegans.  While it doesn&#8217;t contain soybeans, natto is, in essence, a soy product, so if you are sensitive to soy, take note.  While teh label reads 'no soybean', natto is fermented soybean.The bottle contains 30 capsules, with a dosage of 1 per day unless directed otherwise by your doctor.According to studies, natto consumption can aid circulation, and deter blood clotting.  It also can help lower blood pressure, based on some studies.I began taking NattoMax a few weeks ago, after finding my blood pressure, while not high, was higher than usual.  After taking it, I have noticed my bp a little lower.  I am certainly not suggesting natto as an alternative to good diet and exercise, or medical care, but it is a good supplement to consider.
B0013OX9XW This is truly a Godsend!  Not only does this act as a blood thinner, but it is a good alternative to prescription drugs that make the same claim.  Naturally you will want to talk to your doctor before you start any supplement regimen.  That having been said, Jarrow is a trusted name in health related products.  The results you will get from this will most likely be good.  You don't tend to suffer from side effects from this supplement.  I have read accounts by others who have now started enjoying pain free lives and having blood clots busted up inside of them and become history once they started taking this.  I HEARTILY recommend it!
B0013OX9XW I have been taking this for a couple of weeks and have not felt anything noticeable. At the same time I have not experienced any bad side effects either. But this is one of those supplements where you need to take it consistently for a long time before the effects begin to kick in. And this supplement is vegetarian based with no artificial ingredients.
B0013OX9XW As you likely know, Nattokinase is an enzyme created from Natto which is derived from boiled soybeans.  Supposedly, it's a folk remedy for a variety of issues, mostly related to circulatory disorders.  In short, it's a blood thinner, although it may have other beneficial properties.Candidly, I don't &#34;feel&#34; any different, but I will assume that it's doing some good.  Supplements are quite hard to rate, but supposing that it works, it seems like a good product at a good price.  4 stars.
B0013OX9XW This is probably the best way for me to get natto - love it!  Vitamin K-free!  Goodness, I have plenty of supplements with K and don't need more.Natto is made from soybeans fermented with bacillus subtilis.  Some eat it directly on rice for breakfast and it would probably be a good test of my courage to try it that way.  I'm glad to take it exactly in the NattoMax form.
B0013OX9XW I can&#8217;t tell if this has helped or not but the Natto extract supports healthy circulation. I have diabetes with a lot of circulation problems so this supplement was definitely worth trying for me. I will continue to take it because it is just a one-a-day pill and is reasonably priced. I hope that overtime, it can make a difference.
B0013OX9XW Nattokinase is a mix of protein-digesting enzymes derived from fermented soybeans. According to some research, it exhibits a strong  fibrinolytic effect, i.e. it can break-up harmful blood clots and improve circulation.I take protein-digesting enzymes regularly as a part of my supplement regimen. This includes bromelain, papain, and pancreatin (which contains trypsin, to digest protein). Taken on an empty stomach, based on some human and animal studies, they may thin the blood, have fibrinolytic effects, reduce inflammation, lessen the severity of sports injuries, and even prevent the spread of cancer. Nattokinase is another valuable enzyme to go along with these others, except of all the enzymes listed, it may be the most powerful in dissolving blood clots.Since I am younger (35), very healthy (I run about 20 miles a week, eat well, etc), I haven't seen any improvement from taking this supplement. I have taken it along with my other enzymes on an empty stomach before running. I haven't felt anything from taking it per se. However, based on its benefits, I assume it is helping my body avoid inflammation, along with the other enzymes I take.Notice I have mentioned taking this on an empty stomach. Enzymes like Nattokinase will digest food. If taken with food, it will have that effect. The label says take with food, but that is wrong. For the positive health benefits related to circulation, take it on an empty stomach. This way, the enzyme reaches the gut and gets taken up into the bloodstream.One drawback of this product is the price. Other enzymes like bromelain and papain are cheaper. Since I don't have any circulation issues, I will likely stick with cheaper protein-digesting enzymes. However, if I needed them therapeutically to treat circulatory issues, I would definitely add Nattokinase to the mix.Overall this is a good product for a decent price (at least compared to other nattokinase products; all of them are fairly expensive as far as supplements go). I have found Jarrow supplements to be high quality for a decent price, at least when purchased at Amazon.
B0013OX9XW This is a product that has pharmacological effects.  Some folks use St Johns Wort to treat depression instead of taking prescription valium.  Nattomax affects blood clotting and some folks use it a non-prescribed substitute for Coumadin (warfarin).  A lot of people would argue against doing this self prescribing because of the potential for overdose and for unintended side-effects.  However, you cannot argue that it isn;t cheaper than going the prescription route.
B0013OX9XW Nattokinase has been shown to help with lipid profiles. Lowering LDL and Triglycerides and raising HDL.I trust Jarrow's products. I have used them often in the past. Nattokinase alone has been shown to take up to6 month's to see noticeable improvements in blood profiles but it does work. Red Yeast Rice + Nattokinase seems to work faster.Improving blood profiles as quick as 30 days. You can look at a scientific study preformed by theDepartment of Nutrition and Health Science, Chungchou Institute of Technology here [...]
B0013OX9XW Nattokinase prevents fibrinolysis (blood clots/too thick blood) and thins blood. Jarrow Formulas makes this NattoMax 2000 without the use of solvents which I like. It does use magnesium stearate as a flow agent; some people seem to think that magnesium stearate is a form of magnesium that has nutritional benefits for humans but that is not true; it is merely a flow agent used to make it easier to fill the capsules and is considered a dangerous poison by many leading medical experts. If you can not find nattokinase free of magnesium stearate, you may want to try Jarrow Formula's NattoMax.
B0013OX9XW Nattokinase is an enzyme extracted from a traditional Japanese food called natto. Many westerners don't find natto appealing since it is made from fermented soybeans and has a weird texture and taste to it. However, natto has been clinically studied to have the cardiovascular benefits of a blood thinner and clot-buster, to promote heart health and improve blood circulation.Jarrow Formulas has a great reputation for making high quality yet affordable supplemental products. NattoMax has the vitamin K removed since too much vitamin K has the potential to increase blood clots. I ordered the NattoMax to try out. I won't know the results for at least a few months. What I do know is that it's easy to take - just 1 pill a day with meal - and certainly a lot easier to take than raw natto.
B0013OX9XW Jarrow Formulas NattoMax is inferior to Jarrow Formulas Red Yeast Rice + Nattokinase, which additionally to nattokinase contains also red yeast rice beneficial for lowering cholesterol, if with monacolin K.  Nattokinase has only a potential to thin blood, but the effective dosage is unknown.  Thus, nattokinase with unknown effectiveness is inferior to plain aspirin with known blood thining effectiveness.
B0013OX9XW This product is highly recommended for reducing the risk of blood clots and strokes, and has also bee recommended for alzheimer's patients to increase circulation to the brain.I can't vouch for those results as I have only taken this a short time, but the pills are easy to swallow and the scientific studies on this product are encouraging.I would caution against taking this with aspirin as Wiki says that one patient reported a cerebral hemorrhage with taking with this and aspirin, so do use this with caution under the guidance of a physician.
B0013OX9XW I am taking this for a long term benefit.  I wanted to improve my clotting. It is a genetic issue in my family. I haven't had a major bleed while taking this. It is easy to take and I have had no uncomfortable side effects.I find Jarrows products to be high quality and reliable.
B0013OX9XW Actually I know why they removed the vitamin K.  People on Warfarin or Coumadin have their doses set to their current blood levels and cannot change the amount of leafy vegetables they eat or add Vitamin K supplements without exceeding the therapeutic window of their drug.  But hey, that is a niche market (five stars for them) and most of us use natto supplements because both the enzymes and the Vitamin K2.  Jarrow makes great products but my money goes to a nattokinase supplement with the full spectrum.Natto's vitamin K is believed to increase levels of activated osteocalcin and result in a significant reduction in fracture risk.  It also helps blood coagulate.  The stripped down NattoMax does help regulate fibrin. When fibrin accumulates in blood vessels due to age and dietary imbalances, blood begins to flow less freely which can reduce oxygen transport to heart and brain tissue, resulting in suboptimal function. Meanwhile, excess fibrin can make blood vessels less pliable and lead to elevated blood pressure. Even Vitamin-K stripped nattokinase helps to maintain proper blood viscosity, fibrin levels and healthy circulation.To sum up, if you are on blood thinners this is a five star product.  But see if you can work with your doctor to reduce the drugs and take full-spectrum nattokinase and turmeric instead.
B0013OX9XW I can report so far, so good with Jarrow Formulas NattoMax. I have had no trouble taking the 100 mg capsules and no unpleasant side effects.My wife eats natto. I won't kiss her unless she's brushed her teeth. My sons eat natto. I won't sit next to them until they have finished their meal.I can't tell you if natto is more odorous than the King of Fruits, durian, as I haven't traveled to Southeast Asia. From what I've read and seen on TV travel shows, durian and natto are popular with only a minority of the people in the countries from which these foods come.I mention all of this because my wife laughed at me when I first tried this supplement. She offered me a breakfast of rice, dried seaweed and natto instead.\"It is cheaper than taking it from a bottle.\"On that point she is correct. At a cost of more than $10 per month (there's only 30 capsules per bottle), some people might consider eating the fermented soybeans directly. I wish them luck with that as it is too smelly for my palate.I am going to finish out my bottle and add a replacement through Amazon's Subscribe and Save program, which saves me an additional 15%.Rating: Four stars (I'd like to have more capsules in each bottle for convenience.)
B0013OX9XW Nattokinase is an enzyme derived from fermented soy (natto), which is great for clearing blood clots and reducing blood pressure. It normally comes with vitamin K, another blood thinning compound, so Jarrow provides this option of getting the enzyme without vitamin K in case you are already on blood thinning medications. This supplement is safe when used as directed and it is one that is effective for what people usually use it for. Jarrow provides high quality at a reasonable cost. This is certainly an item that can help with specific health concerns.
B0013OX9XW I was very curious about Jarrow Formulas NattoMax, 100mg, but since I've been please with all the Jarrow products I've taken in the past, requested a bottle of 30.  In the test tube, red blood cells do not aggregate in the presence of nattokinase, and since natto is a product which isn't easily available to me, this option for reducing blood clots serves as a viable and more tasty option.  I have not been diagnosed with clotting, however have a genetic disposition and family history, so I'm adding this to my supplement regime.  The vegetarian caps are easy to swallow, I take one daily with a meal, and I've had no reaction or problem.  I'll be ordering the larger bottle to save some money.
B0013OX9XW Nattokinase is an extract that comes from a process of boiling soybeans that have been fermented with a particular bacteria.It is thought to be a blood thinner so it&#8217;s often used to treat issues that affect the circulatory system such as high blood pressure, heart disease, varicose veins, etc. I don&#8217;t have any of these problems, but a lot of people swear by the use of nattokinase.I take it preventatively since blood thinning could protect against blood clots and heart attacks. Obviously, however, there are risks to thinned blood. So, consult a doctor and use care when using this product.I also like the price and the company. Jarrow is a respected manufacturer and adheres to the FDAs GMP (good manufacturing practice). This is important because some supplement companies can be shady. With Jarrow you know the product is high quality and free of adulteration.Overall, this is a great, reasonably priced product that has a load of benefits. If you have circulatory issues, consult your doctor and give it a try.
B0013OX9XW Jarrow Formulas NattoMax is a supplement that is vegetarian friendly.  Natto is made from fermented soybeans and has been used for almost a thousand years.  I have been using the, for almost a month and I'm enjoying the results.  If you're looking to add some natto into your diet then I would start with Jarrow Formulas NattoMax.  Especially for vegans who are looking for a healthy supplement.
B0013OX9XW Since being diagnosed with high blood pressure, I have added an arsenal of cardiovascular-friendly supplements to my diet. The latest is Nattokinase, which clinical trials has shown effective in achieving a moderate reduction in blood pressure. So far, only a couple of days into taking it, I will say that it seems to be helping, showing a couple of points drop since before I started with it. Time will tell whether this will be sufficient, or whether I'll have to take medication.
B0013OX9XW Even though my husband has not has his blood work re-done to see if this has helped any, I still wanted to write about it.  It is a good product in that the pills are easy to swallow and you only need one a day (unless you are directed otherwise by your health professional).  Also, the price is right -I got the 90 ct here for the same price that my local Whole Foods sells the 30 ct for!  Unbelievable.
B0013OX9XW I offer that my past experience with Jarrow's brand of products has been very good. In this case...I am not saying that it has not been beneficial, but it may be just too soon to tell.
B0013OX9XW Because I can't easily find organic natto (the food) I take natto in supplement form.  I am hoping that given enough time it will help to reduce or eliminate some of my health issues such as uterine fibroids, pain during ovulation & muscle spasms.  Jarrow like most of the brands I have found so far contain way too many fillers such as magnesium stearate & hydroxypropylmethycellulose.  Jarrow seems to have the average 100mg or 2000 FU of Nattokinase as other brands as well.  The only difference I've been able to find between the Jarrow brand & others is that Jarrow claims the Vit. K has been removed.The capsules are small & easy to swallow.I'm going to continue to keep a look out in hopes of finding a brand with less fillers.  I recently came across Enzymedica brand & when I finish with this bottle, I think I will try them unless I find something I think might be even better.  With the myriad of supplements I take, I would like to reduce the amount of &#34;other&#34; ingredients as much as I possibly can.
B0013OX9XW While I can't say definitively that NattoMax has helped to lower by blood pressure, it has gone down over the month I've been taking it. It was getting a little high and rather than use prescription drugs, I thought I'd try something a bit more natural. These capsules are easy to swallow and have no detrimental side effects that I've noted. If anything, it makes me feel more mel
B0013OX9XW My husband's blood pressure was running too high and he is against Western Medical treatment.  I saw this and thought it might be worth a try, and he accepted it without any problem.  (This is a man that won't take a Tylenol!)  They are just regular size clear filled gelcaps.  They don't taste like anything to me, and they didn't smell bad.  They are no problem to take.Neither of us had any GI side effects - no burps or unpleasant side effects.After 3-4 days, my husband noted that he was sleeping better -he said I don't hear my pulse in my ears anymore when I lay down.  He reported feeling better.It's about a month's supply, but the supplement itself is definitely a keeper.  His blood pressure started coming down after a week, and is now fairly close to the normal range- it does get a bit borderline but it's MUCH better.For me, I quit taking them because I got a bruise that I couldn't explain.  I don't think I need them though.  My husband, on the other hand, had no bruising problems at all.  Mine might have not been related, but I decided to err on the safe side.The Jarrow brand is very trustworthy to me, and I've never got a product from them that wasn't fresh and of better ingredients.
B0013OX9XW Natto is fermented soybeans and is a popular food in Japan. This supplement is designed to help with circulation and the cardiovascular.The capsules have no taste and go down easy. I'm also thrilled that this is a supplement that vegetarians can take. It is reasonably priced and made by Jarrow, a company that has a proven history of reliability.This product may also help prevent strokes, and I consider it a good insurance policy to keep myself healthy.
B0013OX9XW Check with your doctor before you use natto.  Don't use it if you are on coumadin or warfarin, and be really careful and CHECK with your DOCTOR if you are on an aspirin regimen or if you are taking other medicines that can cause bleeding or if you have or have had an ulcer.Natto basically thins your blood.  It's great if, like me, you have some hyper coagulability (I do - it's one aspect of SLE for me), but it isn't something you want to take along with other blood thinners (including aspirin, gingko biloba, willow bark, and even vitamin e).If natto is something that is going to be safe for you, this is an excellent brand.  I take it when I need a break from my NSAIDs (every so often, I get bounce back headaches from daily use of aspirin, and I have to take a week off).  This keeps my labs stable while I do that.
B0013OX9XW I've been taking this for a number of years. It is an amazing product. Research it and then try it. It works.
B0013OX9XW Nattokinase is an enzyme that thins the blood.  It is supposed to be similar to what warfarin, coumadin and aspirin do, but I would not stop taking these drugs and using the NattoMax without first consulting my physician.  My husband's cholesterol has been on the high side for years and he has only recently begun taking NattoMax so it is too soon to tell if it is helping to reduce his cholesterol levels or not.  But, I feel it certainly is not doing him any harm and the price is so reasonable.  Also, he only has to take one of these pills each day with a meal - usually breakfast.  Since I am required to write a review within 30 days of receiving this product it is too soon to get another cholesterol check done, but I will update this review when he does.
B0013OX9XW Good price and as always with Jatrow, this is a quality product.  Research the product before using if not chosen on recommendation of someone reputable.
B0013OX9XW There are a lot of potential claims about this supplement - increases energy, cellular regeneration, muscle energy & recovery, etc. What you have to keep in mind - Jarrow is a company that tries to stay ahead of the trends. There may be one promising study out there, and Jarrow will rush a formula to market. That doesn't make it bad necessarily, I'm just saying that much more research (effectiveness, dosage, etc) are needed on some of these claims.However, while NattoMax may have lots of unanswered questions around it, the basic ingredient Natto has a long history of cardiovascular benefits - circulation, blood pressure, and prevention of blood clots or stroke. That's why I'm taking it, and I think I'm going to keep it permanently on my regimen. The cost is low (only $10/month), the benefits are clinically proven, there is the potential for additional benefits, and there are basically no side effects. So I'm sticking with it.Hope this helps!
B0013OX9XW Nattokinase is one of many enzymes isolated from the fermented food product known as Natt&#333; (boiled soybeans fermented specifically with the bacteria Bacillus subtilis), and it is supposed to help with circulation (blood pressure and possibly clotting disorders).  Since I don't have a clotting disorder, I can't say whether or not it helps with that.  I can, however, state categorically that this didn't help at all with my blood pressure.For those who do find this formula effective, be aware that it is recommended that you stop taking it two weeks before surgery, due to its possible clot dissolving properties.
B0013OX9XW Jarrow Formulas NattoMax contains 100 mg of natto extract derived from fermented soy in each vegetarian capsule.  It contains nattokinase, a proteolytic enzyme produced by the prokaryotic organism Bacillus subtilis during the fermentation process.The safety-sealed bottle that I received has an expiration date of 09/15, about eighteen months from receipt.All of the supplements that I have tried from Jarrow Formulas seem to be of good quality, and this one is no exception.
B0013OX9XW I read up on this before placing my order.  NattoMax contains Nattokinase  which is an enzyme that acts like a blood thinner and seems to have a positive effect on the cardiovascular system.  Nattokinase is a by-product of soybean fermentation.The Japanese eat Nattokinase all of the time and it is possible that this is the reason they live so long.  Some people with coronary artery disease with 75% blockage reported only a 25% blockage a few months later taking Nattokinase.I think more research is needed but Nattokinase has been consumed by the Japanese for centuries so it is generally considered safe.I'll put it like this: This is on my Subscribe and Save list in the 90 count.
B0013OX9XW I have been eating Natto my whole life. Natto supports both blood clotting and clot dissolving. This NattoMax has the Vitamin K2 removed and only the Nattokinase remaining. This then is suppose to help the body's own fibrin dissolving mechanisms. I like the function of this supplement and would much rather take it than a patented prescription pill.The freshness and quality of the Jarrow formula seems to be potent and active. I have come to trust Jarrow Formulas and consider them a leading manufacturer.
B0013OX9XW They weren't kidding when they said,&#34;natto is not for everyone. Some find its stickiness and strong smell unpleasant.&#34;  Not only do I wholeheartedly concur with that but traditional natto is made from soy which also is loaded with phytoestrogens, which I certainly want to avoid! * Besides it tastes just awful!They did studies that showed rats with carotid artery blockages when dosed with nattokinase regained 62% of blood flow, where others treated with plasmin only regained j15.8%.Other blood substances helpful to vascular well being were incresaed after ingesting nattokinase!Nattokinase helps keep blood vessels clear because its enzymes have been shown to greatly encourage cardiovascular health by restoring normal blood flow because this formula has the vitamin K removed from it.Again, only 4 stars as it contains magnesium stearate, something that most supplement companies add to their formulas but is counterproductive to good health, arghhhh!
B0013OX9XW The same substance can be found in a Japanese food called natto.Natto is a fermented soybean product. Now I love it. Many do not. It is pungent. Think &#34;stinky cheese&#34;.It's great on noodles with some tamari.However, it's hard to make safely. I use a large yogurt maker to keep the temperature right while the natto innoculent grows over the fresh cooked soybeans. It works most of the time, but there is a high rate of spoilage.That's where NottoMax comes in.Get the same health benefits without the hassle of making natto every week.WebMD reports that it has been used for:*Deep vein thrombosis (DVT). There is some evidence that taking a specific combination product (Flite Tabs) might decrease the chance of getting a blood clot in the legs during long plane flights. This product combines a blend of 150 mg of nattokinase plus pycnogenol. Two capsules are taken 2 hours before the flight and then again 6 hours later.*Heart disease.*Stroke.*Angina.*&#8220;Hardening of the ateries&#8221; (atherosclerosis).*Hemorrhoids.*Poor circulation.*Varicose veins.*Peripheral artery disease (PAD).*Pain.*Fibromyalgia.*Chronic fatigue syndrome.*Endometriosis.*Uterine fibroids.*Muscle spasms.*High blood pressure.*Infertility.*Cancer.*Beriberi.*Other conditions.WebMD notes that more studies need to be done to confirm effectiveness for any of those ailments.Bottom line, Jarrow makes great quality suppliments. If you want to explore nattokinase for any of those ailments, I suggest you get it from Jarrow.
B0013OX9XW I'm very happy about the results I've had since taking this.  I'm especially thankful for the gr
B0013OX9XW It is hard to &#34;rate&#34; the effectiveness of a product as the benefits might not be realized for years. This one looks promising though. Used for centuries in Japan, this seems to help the circulation system that could prevent blood clots. I would like to see more studies done, but Jarrow is a trustworthy manufacturer of supplements, so I can recommend this.
B0013OX9XW I take a variety of supplements, from vitamins to fish oil, krill oil and it seems like everything in-between. Both my parents died pretty young, so I'm doing what I can to break that trend. Part of the plan is heart health.  Reading and researching kept turning up Nattokinase , a natural result of soybean fermentation. Nattokinase is an enzyme that acts like a blood thinner, and many experts think it's good for the cardiovascular system. It's one of those natural things that's been used in the orient for centuries.  Is it doing any good? Who can say - I feel great and I'm still here :-)
B0013OX9XW This is a really interesting heart health supplement.  I could be wrong, but I think this has helped lower my blood pressure a little.  As you can imagine, I am impressed!This product also comes in a bottle with 90 capsules, which actually is much more economical per tablet (at the time of my writing, for about $5 more one can get three times more).
B0013OX9XW This will thin your blood naturally and maybe get rid of your blood clots.  .  So if you're already on a thinner you will probably want to talk to your doctor before starting on Nattomax and maybe get it tested occasionally by your doctor after taking it.  This version of Nattomax has vitamin k removed, so it doesn't affect any other thinners you might be on.  I take one in the morning and one at night.Hoping to get off the doctor prescribed blood thinners permanently.
B0013OX9XW I know the great health benefits of eating natto and have been eating it as often as my wife allows me, since she doesn&#8217;t like the smell.  Now I can get the same benefit by taking this pill without annoying my wife.
B0013OX9XW Where to begin? Well, go read the description and decide from there. This supplement seems to provide quite a number of health benefits all rolled into one convenient product. Like all Jarrow Formulas products, this one is consistent and appears to be of excellent quality. There is little odor, no unpleasant or lingering taste, and it is very easy to swallow. Unlike most Jarrow products, this one causes mild stomach upset if taken on an empty stomach, so I'd advise to always take these with some food if you have a sensitive stomach.
B0013OX9XW I've been taking these Jarrow Formulas NattoMax supplements for about 3 weeks.  Prior to being offered this product by the Amazon Vine program, I had never heard of this particular supplement.My extremities are constantly cold, even in warm weather.  I often sit at my desk at work with lightweight gloves on, and I usually sleep with heavy socks.  In the last couple of weeks, I've noticed a big improvement with both of those problems.  It's too soon to tell whether it's a coincidence, or this supplement helping.  The price of these is fairly reasonable, and I plan on ordering another bottle of them.
B0013OX9XW Jarrow is so very reliable with their supplements.  The quality and reliability is always there.  This is a very good Natto supplement.
B0013OX9XW Jarrow Formulas NattoMax is the non-nasty way to consume the health benefits of natto. I apologize if I insult anyone's taste for natto.I cannot tell the affects it has had internally, but I feel about the same. I still think it is worth taking because of the health-related claims of natto.If I could figure out one more way to use natto in a sentence...
B0013OX9XW When I was in massage therapy school, I had to take nutrition classes.  My instructor was a huge fan of nattokinase but, as far as I knew, the only way to get the benefit was by eating natto.  I am an adventurous spirit, but I could never get past the sliminess of natto.  YUCK.  So this was an interesting alternative.  I am very healthy and do not take blood thinners, but I do have issues with varicose veins.  Maybe it is a placebo effect, but I honestly feel like I have less pain when I take this.  Great supplement for anyone with blood or circulatory concerns and is definitely easier to take than the real food alternative.
B0013OX9XW The explanation of the mechanism by which this Nattokinase supplement works is a bit technical, and all I would be doing is parroting what I've read elsewhere . . . so I won't.  I do recommend looking at the write-up on the Amazon Product Description Page.  I have read that particular propaganda on this supplement and am positively influenced.As an aging male (quite common nowadays), I have the typical issues with high blood pressure  and deteriorating circulation.  I also have a family history involving clotting and circulation issues.  I try to minimize, and eliminate where possible, use of prescription drugs, and taking targeted supplements has been a real success in this quest.  After having read the benefits and studies on Nattokinase, taking this supplement is a no-brainer for me.So in addition to taking my array of supplements, which saliently include Omega 3's for circulatory vessel health, and red yeast rice for cholesterol control, I am adding this Nattomax for anti-clotting and circulation enhancement.  Presently, my blood lab numbers are great and I've never felt better.  Starting NattoMax this week, I've had no observed side effects.  So, we'll see how this works out over a period of months.As far as the vendor here, I'm a long time Jarrow Formulas user, and have found their supplements to be of consistent high quality and supported by a good foundation of available information.I'll re-open this review with any important updates, most especially to report anything negative that emerges.
B0013OX9XW I'll be honest, I'd never heard of Natto before. I read about its reported benefits as a natural blood thinner and possibly preventative to Alzheimer's Disease (which runs in the family) and decided, what the hey, why not. Nearly 30 days later and I'm still alive without any negative reactions to the supplements. I couldn't say that I'm any better, but I gather that it is more of a preventativeThe only reported benefit I can mention, and this may be a coincidence, but I am usually a very cold-natured person and since I started NattoMax I feel less inclined to walk around with a blanket everywhere or two hoodies to keep warm. I'm still cold natured, mind you, but less so. Possibly this is due to the circulation benefits of Natto...or the fact that the weather is getting warmer.In any case, the capsules are small and easy to swallow. Take one a day with a meal. I haven't noticed any upset stomach or other negative signs and maybe a few benefits. If you think this will help you, I say go for it.
B0013OX9XW This product helped the person I asked to sample this item by preventing blood clots.  It seems a more delicate solution than other medications on the market.
B0013OX9XW Jarrow Formulas NattoMax, 100 mg, is doing a great job of improving my circulation. My hands and feet have always been so cold. They feel like I should be wearing gloves and socks all the time. Except in the hottest weather I can't go without sock on or even sleep without socks on. My hands and feet feel warmer now and if I touch someone, they aren't jumping when I touch them because my hands are so cold. That definitely says that what it's doing for
B0013OXA5Y I've been taking these supplements because the anti-oxidant power of pomegranates are said to have anti-aging benefits as well as aiding skin cell regeneration. These vitamins are easy to take, have no taste and are less expensive than the juice. I believe that my skin has benefitted from taking these in addition to DHA supplements and will continue to take them everyday.
B0013OXA5Y It's nice to be able to enjoy the (cardiovacular, cellular and anti-oxidant) benefits of Pomegranates without having to worry about cutting through the leathery fruit, geting red juice all over the place (I eat pomegranates over newspapers) chomping on those bitter white seeds, or paying a bundle for the pure juice.The Recommended serving size of  Jarrow Formulas Pomguard is One capsule one or two times a day -- I take 2 or 3 at a time, just once -- I don't take this daily, and I don't believe there is an over-dosing problem with that extra amount, as I have in the past glugged a good share of those pure pomegranate juices, and enjoyed them (except for the astringent action in my stomach from too much of a good thing from those juices).My ONLY concern is the ingredient making up the  Jarrow Formulas Pomguard capsule -\"hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose\" - that is a Polymer, (also used in eyedrops) and not something natural. Aren't there capsules that are made from regular cellulose? Shouldn't that be used instead of the hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose????I guess I can email those concerns of mine to Jarrow and see what they say.
B0013OXA5Y Antioxidants are considered to be pretty good for your body, and pomegranates are a good source of antioxidants.  However, pomegranates are also pretty expensive and difficult to eat, requiring a lot of effort to get the edible seeds out of the fruit.Jarrow has created this supplement from pomegranate extract.  You get the beneficial antioxidants from the pomegranate without the expense or effort required to prepare the fruit for eating.  (And, for those of you up on your Greek myth, no annual trips to visit Hades in the underworld as a result of eating pomegranate seeds!)If you're looking to add antioxidants to your diet, this is a good way to do it.  Recommended.
B0013OXA5Y I used to drink POMWonderful juice daily. Then I realized that PomWonderful, while claiming to have a lot of antioxidants, also has an exorbitant amount of sugar (something like 28 g in one serving).The benefits of pomegranate are desirable for antioxidants as well as cardiofunction, so these vitamins come in handy. I take them as a vitamin C supplement.;, i.e., instead of taking vitamin C.The pill itself is about medium size but easy to swallow. I prefer wrapping it in food and literally taking it \"with food\" for easier swallowing and digestion.The pills are great, but as with any vitamins, try to get as much of the real thing as you can, and only tak the vitamins when the real fruit is unavailable (not in season / you are on the road).These are vegan/vegetarian safe, if you are worried about allergens.
B0013OXA5Y I gave this five stars because I love jarrow Formulas and it is one of three top brands of supplements I usually buy. I am a supplement freak and easily take at least 15 different ones a day. I can't say that I know for sure any of them do anything except for Methyl B12 which I can feel, vitamin C, fiber, and D3. This one, with pomguard, Jarrow's proprietary brand of pomegranite, is one that I just have to use on faith.I am sure you know the hype about pomegranite so I won't rehash it here except to say that it had it's day a few years back as the antioxidant du jour. I, like many others, bought and drank POM, pomegranite juice, for a while until I realized that it didn't seem to do much except add calories to my diet.These little pills go down easily, and I like knowing that just in case they really do help prevent aging and illness, I am being protected by them. Whether you feel the need to add pomegranite antioxidants to your daily regimen is up to you, but if you do, you can't beat Jarrow Formulas as a trusted brand.
B0013OXA5Y I hear a lot about pomegranates' antioxidant properties, but I do not have enough of pomegranate in my diet.  I do not buy pomegranates often because they are only tasty during the season, but then they are quite expensive. The pomegranate juice is available but is expensive and causes me to have a heartburn.  These pills seem to be a good alternative.  They are a good value for the amount of antioxidants they provide and they do not cause heartburn.  That said, after taking this supplement for some time, I do not notice any difference in how I feel, so, hopefully, it is working.
B0013OXA5Y If you're looking for a healthy antioxidant, pomegranate's a great choice.  They're high in antioxidant value (measured in ORACs-Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity) and are VERY beneficial to the cardiovascular system.  I'm using PomGuard for reducing free radical damage; I had to have multiple medically necessary CAT scans & want to limit the long-range after-effects as much as possible, so I actively look for concentrated sources of antioxidants like this.Capsules are so much easier to take than pomegranate juice and have a lot less sugar; these are reasonably priced and personally, I trust Jarrow's quality control--it's one of my favorite go-to brands.I don't know if it's a placebo effect or not, but I take mine about 30 minutes before a treadmill workout and find that it's an energy-booster, giving me more stamina (I can easily walk longer at faster speeds).  I also like this because it's a \"whole food\" antioxidant.  I think in our modern environment, we're bombarded by so many oxidators (indoor and outdoor air pollution, for example) that it's absolutely essential to take a full range of antioxidants and fight back where we can. Nature knows best; I like these!
B0013OXA5Y I love that PomGuard only has real Pomegranates in it, and not any unnatural ingredients.  Since I can only find Pomegranates during a few months of the year, I can rarely benefit from this fruit and its antioxidants.  I love PomGuard because I don't have to worry about that, and I get fruit antioxidants every day of the year.
B0013OXA5Y Many times when I use a supplement I get heartburn or end up with a bad taste in my mouth later on.  These didn't do that.  I used the entire bottle in full, and I didn't notice any visible astonishing benefits, but those aren't necessarily visible anyway.  It's to help cardiovascular function and to be an antioxidant...I can only assume that it achieved that.On another note, there are no contraindications or side effects of note (checking Web MD) and these are organic and vegetarian.  Since pomengranite seems to promise so many health benefits, I'm planning on continuing to use these.  They are pure pomengranite and much easier to consume than with fresh fruit....
B0013OXA5Y Pomegranates is by far one of the most important fruits you can eat.Here in South Florida, we're fortunate enough to have a fairly regular supply of Pomegranates in our supermarkets most of the year.  And, usually one Pomegranate is about $1.50 each.  And, I absolutely love the juice that sits on those seeds.One of my sisters is into health-related products and used to sell those Pomegranate juices for almost $10/ bottle for a 1-litre container.  She swears by its heart-healthy benefits.  I couldn't agree more.***Pomeguard is a dietary supplement and a good thing to have if you're not in an area where you can get fresh pomegranates to eat. The pills are small and easily digestible.No supplement can take the place of eating fresh fruits and vegetables, but this supplement is great to have.
B0013OXA5Y Pomegrante juice is tart and not very appealing.  It is also expensive.Fresh pomegrantes are a mess to prepare.  I usually avail myself of frozen pomegrante seeds. Not all in my family enjoy their crunchiness as I do.This antioxidant formula may be just the boost to our own personal regimen.Time will tell but for now...good product!As always, everyone should research their own medical issues before taking anything that may interfere with meds or existing conditions.
B0013OXA5Y Pomegranates have been used medicinally since ancient times.It's believed to have antioxidant effects.Pomegranate extract may help in heart failure, blood pressure, high cholesterol and for a very, very broad range of ailments.Topically, pomegranates has been noted to help inflammation of hemorrhoids and is also used to eliminate parasites.These Jarrow tablets contain 100% pomegranate extract from California and I believe they are very high quality.
B0013OXA5Y Pomegrantes have become quite the rage.  Touted for their antioxidant benefits, the fruit and their juice have become prohibitively expensive. Moreover it is challenging to extract the seeds.This supplement contains 100% pomegrante extract making it easy and affordable to enjoy the advantages without the mess and expense. The pills are easy to swallow and I noticed no side effects.  As with most supplements of this type, they are prophylactic and their benefits are hard to guage.My experience with Jarrow has been positive. Their supplments are high quality and their customer service people are responsive. If you are looking to incorporate the goodness of pomegrante into your diet, this is an easy way to do so.
B0013OXA5Y I like shifting around the sources for antioxidants in my diet. I never mind buying blackberries, raspberries, or strawberries when they are on sale...but beyond those most of the fruit sources of antioxidants get pretty pricey. This is why I like the Jarrow PomGuard product. I never take these regularly but do take them on days or during a week where I'm not have berries or a fruit juice. Despite their price tag, these are still a better buy than Pomegranate juice and provide the same benefits.With several Jarrow supplements, I have experienced what another reviewer referenced in terms of taste. I don't mind a quick bitter taste, but if you let these linger on your tongue too long before swallowing, you might need more than one glass of water to wash them down.
B0013OXA5Y Pomegranate, good.  Expensive, not good.  Extracts in pill form for POTENTIAL health benefits, cheaper...good.  Pomegranate has been consumed by many nations for thousands of years, by both men and women with no ill effects.  As a supplement, just be aware of the fact that it may raise salivary testosterone.Suggested UsageTake 1 capsule 1 or 2 times per day after meals or as directed by your qualified health care consultant.NOTE: If you have a medical condition or are taking medications, consult your health care practitioner before using this product.Other IngredientsSilcon dioxide. Capsule consists of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose.No wheat, no gluten, no soybeans, no dairy, no egg, no fish/shellfish, no peanuts/tree nuts.Suitable for vegetarians/vegans.
B0013OXA5Y A normal sized clear capsule, Pomguard is easy to swallow, doesn't smell strange, leaves no after taste and has none of the awful and sometimes dangerous side effects of pharmaceuticals.I decided to try this supplement when my last check-up showed that my cholesterol was beginning to head in the wrong direction and I didn't want to take prescription medications to lower cholesterol because of the awful side effects other family members have suffered from taking Statins.As with any supplement, until I see my Physician for blood tests, I will not be able to tell if this has had any positive effects but I will keep taking it in the hopes that it will help lower my cholesterol and with all the anti-oxidants Pomegranate is known to contain it certainly can't hurt to try.
B0013OXA5Y Deciding on a supplement involves around two major decisions. First what supplement do I want, how much of the active ingredient, supporting ingredients, fillers, etc. So what is in it.But the second one that we don't always think about is who is the company? Do you trust them? Will they put in what they see they do at the level they claim and will they keep out what they say they are keeping out? This is my second Jarrow product and I believe from my experiences and other reviews that they are a company to trust. I mostly take Andrew Lessman vitamins for the same reason. They cost more but I believe they have in them what they claim to.As for this itself. If you are considering it you have some interest in pomegranates. I seems to be a very good antioxidant. I am taking this with my Lessmans. On days I take them I feel energetic the whole day through, focused, and in a good mood. I can't separate this one out.But I can say this is a good company and that is very important when considering a supplement. And Jarrow should be on your list to consider.
B0013OXA5Y PomGuard by Jarrow Formulas is a decent supplement.  It consists of capsules containing pomegranate fruit extract from 100% California Pomegranates - NO synthetic ellagic acid.  Other IngredientsThe only other ingredient is silcon dioxide. The capsule is made from hydroxypropylmethylcellulose.As with other Jarrow Formula products, PomGuard contains no wheat, gluten, soybeans, dairy, egg, fish/shellfish, or peanuts/tree nuts.Each capsule contains 425mg of pomegranate extract and there are  60 capsules in the bottle.Pomegranate is an antioxidant, and is believed to support cardiovascular and arterial functions.  Of course, as an antioxidant, it can reduce free radical damage.Jarrow Formulas' recommended dose is 1 to 2 capsules per day.  The extract contains the whole fruit, that is peel, membrane, juice and seed.NOTE: Although the active ingredient in the capsules is pomegranate fruit extract, please keep in mind this looks and smells like pretty much any other gelatin capsule product.  If you are expecting something chewable, sweet, etc. this IS NOT it.The capsules are average size and not difficult to swallow.This is a good supplement if you like to take antioxidants and/or are a believer in some of the benefits attributed to pomegranate.
B0013OXA5Y I've taken various antioxidant type supplements over the past year or so and I switch between brands once in awhile to see which is more effective. As far as the Jarrow brand I've been using their supplements for a couple of years now.I like to work-out a lot and to prevent free-radical damage I take some type of anti-oxidant supplement right after my workouts. I've been taking this for a couple of weeks now and have not experienced any side-effects. Good supplement with high-quality ingredients.
B0013OXA5Y I'm a believer that we're best off eating a wide variety of foods when possible so that we get a variety of different helpful vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and all of that. Usually eating actual food is better, but pomegranate has a good reputation for being an exceptionally healthy choice and isn't necessarily available in fresh form all year long (around here I only see it a month or so a year) so I can see how supplementing with an extract could make sense.Unless you're trying to help a really specific condition, though, this is the kind of supplement I'd tend to mix in every few days rather than as an every day thing. Since I tend to think it's probably best to get a variety of antioxidants, I wouldn't want to fall into the habit of relying on the same pill every day to supply them. I can definitely see where there could be a fair bit of value, though, in using it as an extra source of them a few times a week.The pills are a pretty standard supplement size and just little clear capsules holding red powder. No awful smells or anything that makes them unusually hard to take. If you really wanted, I suppose there's no reason you couldn't pop the capsule open to mix the powder into something for someone who can't/won't swallow pills well.
B0013OXA5Y Pomegranates are marketed as a superfruit. Other superfruits like acai and dragonfruit are all the rage now and pomegranate seems to have taken a backseat. They are high in healthful compounds like polyphenols, which is also found in tea and coffee.One capsule supplies 425mg. Take 1 or 2 capsules a day after meals.
B0013OXA5Y Pomegranate juice is awfully expensive nowadays, and this supplement contains derivatives of pomegranate that are just as beneficial as the juice.  Pomegranate supports a healthy cholesterol level, acts as a powerful antioxidant in our bodies, maintains a healthy blood platelet level, helps with high blood pressure, stimulates collagen synthesis (great for skin!), and more.  Jarrow has done it again.  I have lots of their formulations and consider Jarrow to be my favorite brand for supplements.  Always high quality.  Highly recommended.
B0013OXA5Y Pomegranates are renowned for their anti-oxidant abilities but who enjoys eating a pomegranate?  They are tart and filled with seeds and are more trouble than they are worth.  Pomegranate juice is very expensive.  These tablets therefore are easy to swallow, lack that tart aftertaste, and still provide the benefits of the pomegranate.I take one in the morning after my coffee.  While I can not profess a long life or newborn physical abilities, I know I am taking in the benefits of the pomegranate daily.
B0013OXA5Y I have enjoyed pomegranates since the 1980's (back when they were called \"Chinese apples\"). I can usually get a decent deal on them where I live, but they can be very messy and time consuming to prep. I don't like the commercial juice, as it is way too sweet for me. These supplements are a pretty decent way to get the antioxidants and other health benefits from pomegranates. I would not suggest these over eating the actual fruit though unless pomegranates are hard to find or expensive in your area. Check with your health care provider before taking these to make sure they do not interfere with any medications you are taking. The pills are fairly small and not hard to swallow.
B0013OXA5Y I have not tried any of Jarrow's brand of multivitamins. However when I saw the pomguard tablets and read what benefits the vitamins provided I had to check them out. I really like the idea that they are all natural. I am particular about what I put in my body especially when it comes to vitamins.The tablets are easy to swallow but they do get some getting used to. What I mean is that there is some bitter taste to them. This might be because the tablets are more compact and concentrated whereas when you buy the pom juice it still has a little bitter taste but it is not as concentrated. Overall, I would say this is a good product for your money.
B0013OXA5Y These are fairly large capsules filled with 100% powdered pomegranate extract. The powder is a purple-brown and has a pleasant scent and no discernible flavor when swallowing. I am taking one of these daily along with Jarrow Formulas Quercetin. I hope both together make a potent antioxidant combination.
B0013OXA5Y I would like to buy a lot more pomegranate juice but since it's such a popular juice, it's so expensive and the jars are small! I like this supplement because it's a cheaper alternative to buying bottles and bottles of pomegranate juice and you get the antioxident powers of pomegranites in an easy to swallow supplement.Pomguard supplements a re easy to take and the pills are not too large. I've not had any indigestion or heartburn from this supplement. Pomegranites have been used in healthy diets for a long time, but eating pomegranites can be time consuming and they can be messy and even stain clothes. For many of the benefits of eating pomegranites, I now take Pomguard in a easy to swallow supplement. I make sure and take any supplements with food and not on an empty stomach because they tend to upset my stomach without food. Food also helps to deliver the nutrients throughout your body. Pom juice and fruit juices contain high quanities of sugar and that's anothe plus of taking a supplement such as Pomguard. Jarrow makes high quality, innovative supplements.
B0013OXA5Y The phenolic extracts included from pomegranates have free radical scavenging properties. This helps prevent more diseases and bad conditions than I can cite. Currently there are about a dozen separate trials registered with the National Institute of Health to determine whether the expectations of pomegranates can be validated.I believe this product deserves 5 stars because it's not just extracts from the juice. In fact, the micronutrients in pomegranate seeds, which is included in these tablets, are tremendous and have antibacterial properties.
B0013OXA5Y For those of us who see improved health with supplements, having to take three or six capsules a day, particularly in divided doses, is a real pain.  Thus I am delighted to be able to get what should be a therapeutic dosage in a single daily capsule.  Kudos to Jarrow.I am taking this supplement to lower bad cholesterol.  My doctor wants to put me on cholesterol-lowering medicine and I am resisting.  So I started taking this supplement two weeks ago with no side effects. I don't like the flavor of pomegranate juice so this is a better way for me to get it into my system.My annual physical is several months away and I will continue the supplement until then.  In the absence of a blood test, I have no way of knowing if it is useful.
B0013OXA5Y My mother says Pomegranate is good for your heart.  So...as far as I can tell it's helping me.  I guess it's better than eating beans.
B0013OXA5Y I got this product because i heard great things about it. And i was getting tired of my acai juices. So this is nice to get teh benefits with an easy to swallow pill.
B0013OXA5Y PomGuard is a pomegranate extract and the health benefits of pomegranates are wonderful. The PomGuard pill itself is a medium sized extract filled capsule. It's ok to take. I have a little trouble with the capsules going down as smooth as a regular tablet but it's not that bothersome.I didn't have any side effects or upset stomach with it.
B0013OXA5Y These are easy to swallow and have just the slightest herbal after taste.  They are good for your heart, and there doesn't seem to be any cons to taking these.  I can't say I see any instant results, as I don't have any heart issues.  However, it doesn't hurt to take these.  We could all use extra anti-oxidants in our diet.  I recommend it if you don't get enough of these nutrients daily.
B0013OXA5Y It's fairly accepted that pomegranate is a great anti-oxidant and this is a very convenient way to get that into your diet.  The active ingredient is 425mg of pomegranate fruit extract, with the only other ingredient being silicon dioxide.  It states that the pomegranates are from California.  It doesn't state the amount or percentage of ellagic acid, but it does state that there is no synthetic ellagic acid.  These are in capsule form and have a pleasant smell and a reddish brown color (I've used another brand that had an objectionable smell and taste).  I highly recommend this product.
B0013OXA5Y My husband uses this and we trust the Jarrow name. I don't like to buy brands i have never heard of just because they are cheaper.
B0013OXA5Y Jarrow FormulasPomguard 425mg, 60 TabletsI've always been a big pomegranate fan - they're one of those foods like salads or kale that just make me feel good when I eat them. In recent years many health claims have been made about the health benefits of pomegranates and their antioxidant chemicals, how they contribute to cardiovascular health and help regulate blood pressure. I don't doubt it, although I do wonder is products like this isolate the beneficial phytonutrients from specific plants can ever really replace the benefits of eating the plants themselves, but PomGuard pitches itself as a more holistic product, including all the phytonutrients (or many of them) found in the pomegranate fruit, not just a few separate chemicals thought to have health benefits.My experience with PomGuard is limited, but seems good - I've taken it for about two weeks and felt a notable uptick in what I think of as a citric/fruit feeling, the sort of healthy, energetic burst you feel after eating a grapefruit or lemon.  It wasn't as strong a feeling as if I'd eaten some real, live pomegranate, but it was good enough, and definitely better than when I drink pomegranate juice, which has always seemed a little too sugar-heavy. (I'm not big on juices in general now, after finding out about their astronomical glycemic index and how bad they are for blood sugar levels -- much better to eat the whole fruit or, in this case, a supplement version.)  This product is certainly worth trying, particularly if you have dietary restrictions such as diabetes, but still would like to receive some of the health benefits of this potent fruit.
B0013OXA5Y Pomegranates are already well established for their healthy benefits: A powerful antioxidant, heart health, nourishes skin, and is supposed to be a great inhibitor of women troubles (PMS, menopause issues, ITUs, etc.)Jarrow formulas is a very affordable and easily absorbed product as Pom-products can be rather pricey, Jarrow gets my vote for reliable products that are easily digestible and affordable.
B0013OXA5Y Well packaged, fresh, and intact pills. Good way to sup without getting the sugar found in the juice, which is also expensive. The real fruit is not bad, but is messy. So having something in extract form is nice and Jarrow is a company I trust. No side effects for this product for me. 425mg of extract per pill.
B0013OXA5Y I have been switching back and forth between blueberry and black raspberry antioxidant supplements.  It was nice to switch things up by trying PomGuard.Jarrow is one of my favorite supplement manufacturers.  I trust the products and search for their brands first when looking for a specific supplement.I not experienced any bad side effects to these supplements.  No stomach upset and that is my biggest issue.  I finished the bottle and all was well.Current price point is excellent.  If you are in the market for an anti-oxidant or a supplement for cardiovascular health, I would give Jarrow's PomGuard a try.
B0013OXA5Y Grown in California, USA - WINNER!I take it for my 67 year old cartilage and for LDL cholesterol (see below).LOVE that is is PURE extract and nothing else but capsules.Keeper!Cholesterol can't dissolve in the blood. It has to be transported to and from the cells by carriers called lipoproteins.  LDL, is known as \"bad\" cholesterol. HDL, is known as \"good\" cholesterol.When too much LDL (bad) cholesterol circulates in the blood, it can slowly build up in the inner walls of the arteries that feed the heart and brain. It can form plaque (thick, hard deposit) that narrows the arteries making them less flexible; heart attack or stroke can result.
B0013OXA5Y Jarrow makes some excellent products, and is thoughtful in creating products like this that provide all the benefits of pure ingredients, and suitable for vegetarians and those with specific allergies. According to the label it contains no wheat, no gluten, so soybeans, no egg, no dairy, no fish/shellfish and no peanuts/tree nuts. It costs a bit more than some bargain brands, but you don't have to worry about additives or ingredients (like gelatin capsules) made from animal products.
B0013OXA5Y I really like Jarrow Formula's products, and PomGuard is one of the good ones. Pomegranate has many health benefits, many of the same benefits you get from the ever-popular Acai. It is full of antioxidants, which helps eliminate free radicals from the body. It is also supposed to support cardiovascular function, which I really need right now. The capsules aren't hard to swallow, and you only have to take one once or twice a day. It never hurts to start taking something that's good for your health!
B0013OXA5Y I am a believer in the benefits of the pomegranate, but really do not have the budget to be constantly buying fruits.  I found this to be a great little supplement that gives a fair substitute (though of course not perfect) of eating the fruit--I feel about as good as I do when I am actually eating it.  The pills are quite small and easy to take.  All in all, a great way to get a nutrition boost.
B0013OXA5Y Love this great Jarrow supplement that provides antioxidents and heart healthy formula. Everyone loves the great healing properties of Pomegranate, but some may not like the taste of the juice. While some of the juices are not all pomegranate and the cost can be prohibitive too. Here is a reasonably priced solution. Pomegranate in an easy to swallow capsule.
B0013OXA5Y I'm not entirely sure how to review this product, since I'm not authorized to conduct double-blind clinical trials on human subjects to look for measurable health benefits. It has no particular taste, which is too bad, because pomegranates are delicious as well as lovely. But, since the real thing is expensive and not always in season, I suppose at least I'm getting the antioxidants from the capsules. The capsules are vegan, which is a plus if you don't consume animal products.
B0013OXA5Y I feel much better after taking this supplement. I have not check anything, so I don't know whether something is better than before, but my feeling has been improved.
B0013OXA5Y Jarrow's PomGuard is a product made solely from different parts of the pomegranate, a fruit universally championed for centuries as a healing aid. Many cultures through time have used it as a kind of all-purpose medicine cabinet, from the Greeks and Romans to any number of aboriginal cultures. It's been shown that some of those old guys knew a thing or two that conventional collegiate training didn't deduce. This is apparently the case with pomegranates and anything derived from them. PomGuard incorporates all areas of the fruit, which promotes antioxidation, healthy cholesterol, healthy platelet production, good blood pressure, and something which initially alarmed me called 'apoptosis' (programmed death) - which turns out to be the proper programming of cell death in preparation for new cell production and growth.
B0013OXA5Y I've been reading about the benefits of antioxidants a lot lately. Pretty much every book about health talks about how antioxidants counteract the free radicals floating around your system that can cause cancer. These free radicals are in foods that most Americans eat far too much of, such as polyunsaturated fatty acids, packaged foods, and fried foods.There's no denying that pomegranates are trendy right now. But are they the best antioxidant available? It's written on the bottle that pomegranates contain a wide range of polyphenolic compounds including ellagic acid, anthocyanins, and ellagitannins. I did a quick internet search for \"types of polyphenols\" to find out more about the polyphenols found in pomegranates.Ellagic acid has been shown from preliminary laboratory evidence to have anticancer properties, but there is not yet any clear evidence from clinical studies showing that for sure. It may also protect your cardiovascular system from plaque formation and stiffening of the arteries.Anthocyanins are said to be part of the reason that red wine drinkers in France and Italy have lower rates of coronary heart disease. It may also have anti-inflammatory properties.Unfortunately, I found some conflicting information about polyphenols when researching \"risks of polyphenols\". For one, certain polyphenols may have carcinogenic effects or may interfere with thyroid hormone biosynthesis. This is particularly true in the case of soy isoflavones, but may also be true for other polyphenols. In addition, the consumption of polyphenols may inhibit iron absorption. Lastly, polyphenols may interact with certain pharmaceutical drugs and enhance their effects. That would give me pause if I was taking any type of prescription drug. While none of this has been proven in clinical studies, there's enough of a concern that I would only personally take a polyphenol supplement for a specific reason, not necessarily as an everyday thing just for long-term preventative benefits.These pills from Jarrow brand are in a standard capsule shape with powder inside. When you open them up, they have a very bitter flavor such as that of concentrated cranberries. There is no discernible odor, and they are as easy to swallow as any other standard gelcap.
B0013OXA5Y My health care provider is NUTS about pomegranates and wants me to have half of one every day, but what a hassle! Pomegranate juice is so much easier, and has all the benefits, (except fiber) but WOW it's expensive - even more than the fruit! So here's the answer - PomGuard - a simple, easy to take, high potency PILL! What could be better? Recommended.
B0013OXA5Y Pomegrantes are all the rage in health news right now. They have lots of healthy antioxidants and are great for heart health and other things. I love pomegranates and wish I could eat enough of them to get the fantastic benefits.Unfortunately for me, where I live poms are very expensive. If you can find them, they are less than fresh and appealing. I have tried adding pomegranate juice but that is also expensive. So I was glad to try Jarrow's PomGaurd. It smells a little unappealing. But the pills are easy to take. I did not experience any stomach upset. This is a great less expensive way to get the benefits without trying to eat a four dollar dessicated pomegranate every day.
B0013OXA5Y The Jarrow Formulas Pomguard 425mg, 60 Tablets is a great supplement to get your daily intakes of pomegranates even when it is not available or in season in your particular location. Pomegranates, as everyone who is into fruits, is considered as one of the \"superfruits\" because of the varied and tremendous amounts of nutrients that can be derived from eating this fruit. It contains compounds which supports cardio health by lowering cholesterol, maintaining an ideal blood pressure and helps prevents or minimize arterial blockages in the heart. It also contains a good amount of antioxidants which inhibits the development of some cancers. Since this is a tropical fruit, it is mostly available here in the midwest during the summer where I take advantage of eating a lot of this fruit while it is seasonally available. With the Pomguard, a tablet a day, assures you of getting the full nutrional benefits of Pomegranates all year round. Very happy with this supplement and will be making this a part of my daily supplemental intake. Highly recommended!
B0013OXA5Y Here is a easy way to get the benefits of pomegranates, which for me are only available at certain times of the year, and I find the juice drinks to expensive.This is a capsule type with dry fill, even though website lists as a tablet. Taken once a day, I have no problems taking this one, no upset. Happy with product. 60 day supply.
B0013OXA5Y This dietary suppliment from Jarrow is a nice source of antioxidents.Each bottle contains 60 capsules.Contains 100% California Pomegranate fruit extract.
B0013OXA5Y With a family medical history that includes Alzheimer's, cancer, and heart disease, I've been taking antioxidants for several years, including pomegranate extracts, juices, and teas. I've taken other Jarrow products, so I had no problem with changing to Jarrow Pomgard capsules. Most of the other pomegranate supplements that I've tried weren't always clear on what parts of the fruit were used, but Jarrow's formula includes the whole fruit extract - juice, peel, seed, and membrane. That's the only way to know that you're getting all the benefits of the pomegranate.I've done a lot of personal research into the alleged benefits of taking pomegranate supplements, and it's an impressive list. If only a few of the claimed benefits are realized, then it's well worth taking.
B0013OXA5Y Pomegranate has so many health benefits but unfortunately I really don't like the taste of the juice. Also, a lot of fruit juices have a lot of sugar which I try to avoid. Therefore a capsule such as this one--100% pomegranate extract and nothing else--is a great thing for me. Both my husband and I take this capsule for it's antioxidant properties and to help improve cardiovascular function.This capsule isn't too big in size and doesn't have a funny taste when you swallow it. You only have to take one or two a day which isn't bad at all. I also try to take a flaxseed capsule for cardiovascular health but that capsule is so much bigger in size and is actually rather difficult to swallow. I'm not great at taking pills so i'm glad that this PomGuard capsule isn't overly large.I'm very happy with this product.
B0013OXA5Y The label indicates Pomegranates are loaded with anti-oxidants for cardiovascular health, however, one of my mentors who was raised in the Asian culture shared the wisdom of consuming pomegranates for urinary tract health. Previously I was often dealing with UTIs but since I began consuming more pomegranates and pomegranate based supplements, I've rarely experienced UTIs and now they are much easier to deal eliminate them when one begins, they no longer gain a strong foothold as before. I am impressed with the quality found in all the various Jarrow Formula supplements I have sampled. The bottle I received from Amazon had approximately 18 months remaining.Per the label:Serving Size 1 Capsule  Servings per Container  60Pomegranate Extract  425 mgOther ingredients: silicon dioxide. Capsule consists of hydroxyproylmethylcellulose.No wheat, no gluten, no soybeans, no dairy, no egg, no fish/shellfish, no peanuts/tree nuts.Suitable for vegetarians/vegans.Usage: Take 1 capsule 1 or 2 times per day, after meals, or as directed by your qualified health care consultant.  Note: If you have a medical condition or are taking medications, consult your health care practitioner before using this product.  ... derived from 100 % California Pomegranates, contains a wide range of polyphenolic compounds including ellagic acid, anthocyanins and ellagitannins.  ... NO synthetic ellagic acid.
B0013OXA5Y I usually pick up some pomegranate juice once in a while for its health benefits (and i like the taste), but it is so expensive.  These tablets contain 425mg of pomegranate extract and are easy to swallow.
B0013OXA5Y I'm a definite believer in adding antioxidants to your diet. I also like facial products with antioxidants. I drink teas with antioxidants. I try to eat a \"rainbow\" of foods, and include various forms of nutritional antioxidants daily.I know I don't eat enough fruit, and I don't have the patience to eat actual pomegranites. So this is kind of a treat for my body.On the days I know I'm going to eat poorly - as on holidays, when traveling, or if I'm just super busy - then I make sure to grab antioxidant supplements.Pomegranite is one of the top \"faddish\" antioxidants, but some research shows it's a good one, up there with blueberries, acai, red wine, green tea, and vitamins A and C.The bottle recommends taking these after - not during - a meal.The pills come in a clear cellulose form of capsule, containing a reddish chunky powder. The bottle smells vaguely of fruit when you sniff the inside.The pills are 3/4s of an inch and are easy to swallow.There are sixty pills in a bottle and the serving size is one pill. As a two- month supply, this is a pretty good deal. I can stretch this out a bit by changing around which antioxidant pills I take that day. I try to mix it up with other antioxidants supplements, and if I have a big fruit day, I leave it at that.Recommended as part of an array of antioxidant sources. Nice quality pills.
B0013OXA5Y When I operated natural food stores and pomegranates were in season, I'd drink the juice of one every day by squeezing it all around, pricking it with my produce knife (used to butt heads of lettuce, etc.), and sucking the juice out. More recently when I learned about the antioxidant properties of pomegranates, I tried some juices that contained pomegranate juice, but I was never that impressed with the flavor nor with the amount of pomegranate said on labels to be actually in each serving. Jarrow Pomguard allows one to get the benefits of pomegranate by simply taking a daily capsule.WebMD has an informative article on the uses, side effects and interactions of pomegranate. Those considering taking a pomegranate supplement such as Jarrow PomGuard who also take prescription medications may want to check out the section on interactions at WebMD (e.g., pomegranate can lower blood pressure so someone taking any kind of medication that can also decrease blood pressure should be aware of this, plus one should know that pomegranate can \"decrease how quickly the liver breaks down some medications\").Jarrow Formulas is held in high regard in the natural food industry. Jarrow has won many awards from a number of journals and magazines geared toward natural food, nutrition and vitamin industry insiders. Based on my experience in the industry (I operated natural food co-ops and for-profit stores from the mid-70's into the early 90's) and my familiarity with Jarrow brand supplements (I've used and continue to use quite a few), I rank Jarrow highly among supplement brands in terms of quality and fair pricing.
B0013OXA5Y I take several supplements recommended by doctor and nutritionist, and although Pomguard is not one on their list, from what I have read and researched, it is good for the body in many ways.  I don't drink pomegranate juice because the sugar content is too high, so I am putting my confidence in these tablets.  .  I have tried several Jarrow products from the amazon Vine Program and they appear to be a reputable company with few additions to their products.
B0013OXA5Y This amazon page says the capsule contains gelatin, but my bottle says the capsules are vegetarian and made of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose. I don't know if they could have changed the capsule, but the image of the bottle also says vegetarian, so I'm going to assume it is.I'd love to eat a pomegranate every day. Love 'em. Or drink a bunch of pomegranate juice. Love that, too. Pretty expensive and not always in season, though. The best is when this place at the farmer's market has frozen some juice from their fall crop and has it when the market opens in the spring! But I digress...These capsules seem like a good way to get the healthy benefits of pomegranates without trying to find a pomegranate every day. I stuck my nose in the bottle and it smelled faintly of pomegranate. I opened a capsule and tasted the red powder inside. It was very bitter. Probably not surprising since this is supposed to be extracted from the whole fruit, peel, seed, everything, plus the capsules also contain silicon dioxide.The label says it contains 425mg of pomegranate extract. I wish I knew what that meant or how the different parts of the pomegranate compare in terms of antioxident levels (so is it good or bad that they use the entire fruit, even the peel?) I wish I knew how much fresh or frozen pomegranate I'd have to eat to equal the same amount. These do seem like a convenient way to get some antioxidents, and if you are intent on getting some ellagic acid, anthocyanins and ellagitannins, then it's worth a shot.
B0013OXA5Y There are a variety of ways to get the benefits of pomegranate into your diet. Of course, drinking the juice or eating them is a great way to do that (but some commercial juices have very little actual pomegranate, so read the label.) This supplement is made of pure pomegranate extract and is not synthetic. It contains a mixture of ellagic acid, anthocyanins and ellagitannins.Ellagic acid is also found in blueberries and cranberries. It's not only an antioxidant (prevents damage of cells by free radicals, which are small, highly reactive molecules) but it is believed to be \"anti-proliferative\" or an inhibitor of cancer. Lots of fruits, nuts and vegetables contain these substances (dark red fruits have anthocyanins and ellagic acid is in many nuts and berries.) So if you feel you do not get enough of these into your diet, you can supplement with this extract of pomegranate juice.
B0013OXA5Y Pomegranate is one of the recent superfoods, being extolled for its polyphenol content and the anti-oxidant and radical fighting properties thereof.What I like about Jarrow's PomGuard is that the extract is from the whole fruit (skin, seed and juice) instead of just the juice. The phytonutrients are more bioavailable when the whole fruit is consumed. Also, the pomegranate extract is 100% from California pomegranates without any synthetic ingredients.An interesting ingredient I found in this product as well as some other Jarrow capsules is silicon dioxide, aka sand. It's used to prevent powders from clumping together. At first I thought it was pretty gross to ingest sand but on further research I also found that silicon is a necessary trace element for bone development and lots of natural foods contain silicone dioxide, and it decreases the risk of dementia.Back to pomegranate capsules, PomGuard is the one I like best. I've looked at a variety of them on the internet and Jarrow's product comes with the most detailed provenance, it tells you exactly what it contains and where its from, so this is the one I would recommend most.
B0013OXA5Y Lots of people fail to eat enough fruit.  I am one of those people.  So I am always looking for ways to (easily, if possible) add fruit to my diet.  This is one great way to add some of the benefits of eating more fruit.
B0013OXA5Y For about a year, I subscribed to a monthly delivery of POMx pills, made by POM Wonderful.  Since pomegranates contain polyphenols and help neutralize free radicals, the choice to consume 1g daily was really an easy decision.  Over the course of using POMx for a year, I didn't really notice any readily apparent changes although there were probably internal and less visible benefits to my cardiovascular system and function as well as a reduction in oxidative damage.Being no stranger to Jarrow Formulas supplements, I was pleasantly surprised to see them offering PomGuard, their own pomegranate pill based on 100% California Pomegranates.  One of the obvious differences between PomGuard and POMx is the potency of the pills - PomGuard pills supply 400mg of pomegranate powder consisting of a range of polyphenolic compounds.  POMx pills provide 1000mg per capsule of their proprietary blend.  POMx is an extract of the polyphenol compounds from the whole fruit.  Likewise, PomGuard is the juice, peel, seed and membrane components of the pomegranate.  I guess as long as they both end up supplying polyphenols, the benefit is the same, though POMx seems to win the potency battle.  Do you need the equivalent of 8 oz. of pomegranate juice per day?  It ends up being your personal decision.One attraction to PomGuard is the price point which is approximately 60% less cost than POMx.  I think as a maintenance dose, PomGuard would be my choice for daily consumption.  I have noticed no ill effects from PomGuard.  Reaping the same benefits at a lower cost seems like a win-win for me.
B0013OXA5Y Pomegranate juice made from the fruit and rind has a higher level of antioxidants than juice made without the rind.  Since PomGuard includes the rind, hopefully this increases it's antioxidant levels as well.  According to Jarrow, \"PomGuard is the only supplement to combine beneficial elements from the whole fruit, including the juice, seed and peel in a single capsule.\", so if you want the benefit of all the parts of the pomegranate in a pill, this appears to be the only option.  Jarrow also says that PomGuard has \"NO synthetic ellagic acid.\"Although I prefer to eat the fruit, by taking a PomGuard pill most days, I can eat other fruits as well, without overdoing the sugar that fruits contain (I'm a low-carb person). Since I don't eat the peel when I eat the fruit, PomGuard offers an advantage here too.
B0013OXA5Y My husband is the type of person to always worry about his heart so he eats a lot of things that promote heart health, including pomegranates. But they're very expensive so instead he started taking PomGuard and he's impressed. He says they don't have a funny aftertaste and they're just like eating a pomegranate every day for your heart.
B0013OXA5Y Pomegranates are so full of vitamins and so healthy for you - but dang, they're expensive to buy and hard to eat!  Jarrow Formulas Pomguard has all the benefits of eating pomegranates all packed into one little pill.  The pill is not large, easy to swallow, and delivers quite a healthy punch of vitamins and antioxidants.  While I can't give numbers on how effective they are in my system, I can say that I eat them and feel great.  Recommended.
B0013OXA5Y As I have stated in other product reviews on items from this company, I normally always like their products. This is another one that I submit is worth looking at. I am taking this product to help introduce more antioxidants, and pomegranate extract is a good source of these. This product is in a convenient form for me to do this, because this fruit is very seasonal in my area.
B0013OXA5Y It has been proven to have cardiovascular protective effects. It is good to drink the pure pomegranate juice but that gets quite expensive. These are easy to swallow capsules that have not caused me any side effects. Like all supplements you should check with your health care provider before adding anything new. You can take 1 to 2 a day after meals. I take one as I take quite a few Jarrow supplements as I trust the quality.
B0013OXA5Y I have been buying the Pomegranate juice at my local grocery for about six months ago. It costs me around $10 a week for a small shot a day.. These have more nutrients in them than the juice, Pomegranate is a supplement that has a lot of power health benefits including hearth and blood health. I have replaced juice with these, and am saving a lot of money! I take two a day between meals. No side effects at all!
B0013OXA5Y I've always heard about pomegranates being good for you due to their red color and antioxidant properties.  However, I've never bought them and really don't like the idea of dealing with all the seeds.  This supplement gives you all the health benefits of poms in a little pill.  Perfect.  I trust Jarrow for many of my vitamins and supplements, so the brand was a go for me.  I've been taking it daily, and, whereas I know I can't tell a difference, I feel like I've got some daily insurance that I'm doing something for my health and trying to offset free radical damage.  Of course, a pill like this won't give you the fiber and moisture that you get from fruits and veggies, so I eat lots of them daily.  But I will continue taking this insurance on a daily basis.
B0013OXA5Y Jarrow Pomguard is one of the many supplements that support cardiovascular health that I have.  I will try to always take supplements for that, and many, because I've had high cholesterol.  I refuse to take statins because of muscle and other damage.  Out of the 2+ shoe boxes of supplements I take daily, many of them support bone and cardiovascular health.  Jarrow makes many of them.Jarrow is mid-priced, but quality!More from Amazon:Jarrow FORMULAS PomGuard ; derived from 100% California Pomegranates; contains a wide range of polyphenolic compounds including ellagic acid; anthocyanins and ellagitannins. Contains only pomegranate fruit extract from 100% California Pomegranates - NO synthetic ellagic acid. PomGuard : Supports cardiovascular functionReduces oxidative damage by free radicalsSupports healthy cell replication and functionKeep out of the reach of children.Patented Production Technology Yields the Ultimate Pomegranate SupplementPomGuard(tm) from Jarrow Formulas represents a new standard in antioxidant supplements. PomGuard is the only supplement to combine beneficial elements from the whole fruit, including the juice, seed and peel in a single capsule. Clinical studies have linked pomegranates to cardiovascular health and uncovered several groundbreaking discoveries about the fruit's synergistic properties. This research led to PomGuard, a product which offers the complete spectrum of beneficial pomegranate phytonutrients.*Historical Uses of the PomegranateThe use of pomegranates for healing dates back to Biblical times. Healers in many aboriginal cultures still employ the bark, leaves, peel, juice and seeds to treat many health conditions. This knowledge was brought back to Europe in the Medieval and Renaissance periods. The British Medical Association and the Royal College of Physicians of London feature the pomegranate in their coats of arms. However, this fruit has been overlooked by modern Western medicine until very recently.Antioxidant ActivityPomegranate juice is higher than tea and red wine in antioxidant activity. Indeed, in Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC) testing, a standard for antioxidant capacity, fresh pomegranate fruit and juice preparations also surpassed the antioxidant activities of cranberry, blueberry and grape juices, all of which have been touted for their free radical scavenging properties. PomGuard's mixture of juice, peel and membrane plus seed also contains approximately 20% pure pomegranate seed lignins. Lignins complement phenolic antioxidants (e.g., ellagic and gallic acids), by scavenging oxygen and nitric oxide free radicals.There is a great diversity to antioxidant action, with hundreds of different compounds acting on different types of free radicals. Nature's answer is to maintain broad-spectrum protection. Thus, in plants, phenolic antioxidants typically are associated with lignins.The superiority of antioxidant mixtures to single antioxidants is well known. In a series of studies, the antioxidant power of pure antioxidants was compared to (a) the antioxidant or cardioprotective action of complex tannins like punicalagin, (b) mixtures of punicalagin and other pomegranate tannins, and (c) whole pomegranate juice. Though punicalagin was more potent than the other single compound, the tannin mixtures were more potent than any single compound, and the whole pomegranate juice was more potent than the tannin mixture.Studies and BenefitsPomegranate juice and other fractions are known to provide numerous benefits:* Supports healthy low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) oxidation status** Enhances glutathione action, the primary antioxidant and heavy metal protector inside cells** Help maintain healthy blood platelet activity** Promotes healthy levels of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), an enzyme involved in blood pressure regulation** Supports normal cell function and replication** Induces apoptosis (programmed death)** Stimulates collagen synthesis and supports healthy cartilage life*Clinical trials with pomegranate juice at several institutions have shown significant favorable results in support of prostate, blood sugar, blood pressure, heart and arterial health and function.*
B0013OXA5Y I enjoy pomegranate juice, but it's expensive. I'm a big fan of most Jarrow products, and I'm glad they have this product because I can get a large dose of pomegranate in my diet.This is excellent if you're looking for anti-aging products. It's also good for coronary health.
B0013OXA5Y Of course I would prefer to consume the actual food rather than taking a supplement of any sort.  Real food is better when its possible, but there are certain foods that although beneficial, can be difficult to enjoy on a regular basis.I love pomegranates but only seem to have them occasionally at a salad bar or perhaps a glass of juice.  I once tried to buy and de-seed one and only succeeded in making quite a mess.  They are very good for you because they are high in antioxidants and are full of vitamin C and potassium.This supplement is easy to swallow, but it is a bit larger than an average capsule.  I have tried many products by Jarrow and have been pleased with their quality.I have been taking one per day so this bottle is a two month supply for me.  The directions indicate taking 1-2 daily.  This supplement combined with a healthy diet, exercise and my usual vitamin/mineral regime works fine for me.
B0013OXA5Y Most people know about Jarrow and how apparently good they are.  This prouct really seems to do a lot of things.Included is:Help maintain healthy blood platelet activity.  This is so important.  I have never known a vitamin or herb to do this and when my Pop was in the hospital with critically low levels of platelets this might have helped him.Supports normal cell function and replication.  In my opinion this is important to prevent cancer, because cancer is  cell replication that has gone haywire.Stimulates collagen synthesis and supports healthy cartilage life.  This is great for older joints and also athletes.It is have shown significant favorable results in support of prostate, blood sugar, blood pressure, heart and arterial health and function.  Well the jury is out but if you can take one pill a day to help in all those areas, I'm in!
B0013OXA5Y These tablets are reasonable size and go down easy. Loaded with the concentrate of the most healthy fruit on the planet. Pom is great tasting fruit but is not avaialble all year round, hence I low PomGuard as I have it available all year round for good health and prevention.
B0013OXA5Y I really love to eat pomegranates, but can't always find them in the store, or deal with the mess.  I prefer the real deal over supplements any day, but these are nice to have when eating a live pomegranate is not an option.  I know pomegranates contain a high amount of anti-oxidants and other valuable compounds, and I try to eat at least one every other day.  When I can't I take one or two of these supplements.They are easy to swallow and hopefully work almost as well as a real pomegranate.  Don't forget all the fiber you get when you eat a pomegranate so don't just take these supplements to the total exclusion of eating the real things.
B0013OXA5Y I've happily found that Jarrow supplements tend to both work well and be well tolerated by my body.  I do feel a mild boost in immunity when taking pomegranate.  (Although, I'd rather just skip these pills and eat the yummy fruit or drink the yummy juice.)These are NOT marketed or intended as contraceptives (and I am in no way qualified to recommend them as such!), however it is said that in ancient times pomegranate seeds were used as contraceptives and abortofacients.  Two very good reasons to avoid these during pregnancy.  If you are pregnant, please take extra care in speaking with your doctor about any supplements you are considering.As always when reviewing a supplement, I wish to state that I am not a medical professional and remind you to seek input (and approval) from your medical provider before taking this or any supplement.
B0013OXA5Y For years I've been reading about all the benefits of pomegranates, and I love the taste of both raw pomegranate and pom juice.However, I don't eat/drink pomegranate because of a low glycemic diet...and not to mention the expense. The supplements are a great way to get all the benefits without having to eat the actual fruit.As you may know, the more antioxidants in your diet the better. Antioxidants help ward off free radicals, which cause many diseases including most cancers, cause skin problems & premature aging, etc etc. And, pomegranates are about the most potent form of antioxidants on the planet.And I just learned recently that pomegranates also enhance glutathione action, which is how your body flushes a wide variety of toxins including heavy metals from your system (mercury from fish, lead from the environment, etc).So I love these supplements, and the price is about average, nothing bad to say about them at all. However, for things like this I prefer to buy powder (sold by the ounce, or by the kilo) and add it directly to shakes, smoothies, other drinks like lemonade, or even baking.We often drink protein shakes in the morning, and it's easy just to pre-mix the raw pomegranate powder along with the shake mix, so I don't have to remember to add it. The cost of powder vs. capsules is much cheaper, and it's one less pill I have to remember to take. You can actually do this for just about anything, including 1-a-day vitamins. I'm still experimenting with different brands (obviously one bag lasts a *looong* time) so I don't have a recommendation.I haven't decided yet which company is best quality and price, but if you're interested in this method it's easy to find powder suppliers on google, the auction sites, direct from manufacturers, and even on Amazon. I can say that Navitas sells supplements in powder form on Amazon, and it's convenient and good quality, but they are also the most expensive powder I've seen (at about $2.25 per ounce). Though that's still cheaper than capsule form (this whole bottle of Jarrow 60 capsules is 25.5 grams, which works out to about $14 per ounce!).Food for thought - hope this helps!
B0013OXA5Y While this won't get rid of an active prostate infection, it works very well at keeping my husband's prostate issues at bay after the infection is gone.
B0013OXA5Y I love pomegranates and eat them almost everyday when they are in season (I see them in stores only October through January). They are expensive but delicious and very healthy. Now I can have a benefits of this superfruit for the whole year and way cheaper. Of only the pill would taste the same;)
B0013OXA5Y Supports Cardiovascular Function- I have always been a fan of Jarrow and this product hasn't changed my mind. Jarrow Formulas Pomguard 425mg, 60 Tablets does everything that they claim to do for me. I have used this particular product for about three months. I have blood work regularly done for my high cholesterol, among other problems. I haven't noticed any magical changes, but have noticed a slight dip in my try's and cholesterol. This is great, because my Try's and Cholesterol has continued to increase over the past twenty years and I have used every pharmaceutical medication offered since 1990, as well as watching my diet. To no avail, nothing has helped lower these or prevent the increase until using Pomguard 425 mg pills. I do have heart disease and while continuing my use of mentioned meds, I use Jarrow as a supplement because I'm allergic to niacin, the most common supplement.Provides Antioxidant Protection- I am aware that pomegranates has long been known as an method of antioxidants. I have researched the use of pomegranates and good health for a while. My 94 year old grandmother had pomegranates trees long before the research proved it is an antioxidant. The older southern people relied on home remedies to help with good health and better living.  What I am saying is I truly believe in natural supplements, much like my southern ancestors, that had a long, good life even before they knew of cancer. I highly suggest that anyone of any age use such products.
B0013OXA5Y Potential health benefits per WiKi:In preliminary laboratory research and clinical trials, juice of the pomegranate may be effective in reducing heart disease risk factors, including LDL oxidation, macrophage oxidative status, and foam cell formation. In mice, \"oxidation of LDL by peritoneal macrophages was reduced by up to 90% after pomegranate juice consumption...\".In a limited study of hypertensive patients, consumption of pomegranate juice for two weeks was shown to reduce systolic blood pressure by inhibiting serum angiotensin-converting enzyme. Juice consumption may also inhibit viral infections[54] while pomegranate extracts have antibacterial effects against dental plaque.Despite limited research data, manufacturers and marketers of pomegranate juice have liberally used evolving research results for product promotion, especially for putative antioxidant health benefits. In February 2010, the FDA issued a Warning Letter to one such manufacturer, POM Wonderful, for using published literature to make illegal claims of unproven antioxidant and anti-disease benefits.
B0013OXA5Y The use of Pomegranate is said to have very rich antioxidant properties, the development if. Supplement makes it easier to benefit from this fruit. The juice itself takes time to acquire a taste, which I still have not, so the pill form is a great idea!
B0013OXA5Y I've been taking these for a while and feel better, more energized!! I have not had any negative side effects. Reading up on the ingredients, this is a good formula. I'm starting to really like Jarrow.
B0013OXA5Y Wow, I didn't know that Pomegranate juice is higher than tea and red wine in antioxidant activity!I was taking those ( tea and red wine extract)in supplement form, along with drinking green tea (without milk or sweeteners for its antioxidant properties, definitely not \"yummy\", but best utilized when taken that way.However I have switched to this Pomguard. it is one of those things that I have not \"felt\" any difference but due to the family history of heart trouble & high blood pressure it is just smart to be proactive in this area! Not to mention it is cheaper than what I was spending on less effective antioxidants, so for me it is a great value!
B0013OXA5Y I have been diagnosed with high blood pressure but am currently not on any medication.  Fortunately, since stopping the medication, my blood pressure has been stable.  However, I don't want to take chances.  Jarrow's Pomguard is an anti-oxidant to help with your cardiovascular system and blook pressure.  So far I'm very impressed with it.  I took my blood pressure every day and it never went up while taking this supplement.  I highly recommend this product.
B0013OXA5Y I love pomegranates, but they're not the easiest fruit to consume. Full pomegranates are messy and alternative sources are often quite expensive. That's where these tablets come in.These pills are easy to take and supply you with the antioxidants that you'd get from a regular pomegranate. The pills themselves have a slight odor, but this doesn't really make them harder to take. I've taken them with food and on an empty stomach and there have not been any issuesIf you're looking for more antioxidants in your diet, you should give these tablets a try. They're easy to take and get you all the benefits of the fruit without any of the hassle.
B0013OXA5Y It's best to get your nutrients from whole foods, rather than supplements.  This isn't always practical however.  Pomegranates can be expensive and they're not always in the stores, plus they can be messy to eat.PomGuard contains a wide variety of polyphenolic compounds, including ellagic acid, anthocyanins and ellagiannins.  I had to look these up, since I wasn't exactly sure what these were.  I knew they were good for me, but that was about it.  These are powerful antioxidants that can help reduce inflammation.Why I like this product:* The pills are gel caps, small and easy to swallow.* The pills don't have an unpleasant smell, like several other supplements.* It's an easy way to get antioxidant protection.  Plus, each pill has a concentrated amount of the polyphenolic compounds.* The pills are easy on my stomach.  I suffer from gastritis and acidic fruits like pomegranate can make me feel very nauseous.  I can take the pills with no side effects.As with any supplement, you should check with your doctor before taking these.  These can interfere with statins or blood pressure medication.I do recommend these as a great way to add more antioxidants to your diet.  Of course, eating the whole foods is better, but this can be a nice supplement to that.
B0013OXA5Y I liked the tart taste of this fruit, but they were messy and slow to eat, and so these days, I'm quite content taking these easy-to-take tablets.  They offer all the health benefits of pomegranates without the nuisance of eating.  Highly recommended.
B0013OXA5Y Most sources tell you pomegranates are a big deal super food.  They and pomegranate juice are expensive, however, and the juice may have added sugars to make it tastier so that's added calories.  This Jarrow pomegranate extract is probably the way to go to pay out less money and consume less calories.Depending on what source you read, you can find that pomegranates do everything from help you lose weight to prevent cancer.  There's not yet hard evidence to substantiate most assertions.  However, since pomegranates are rich in polyphenols and have antioxidant value, anyone gung-ho antioxidants will be happy to take this supplement.  There's little evidence you can be harmed and a good chance it may help y
B0013OXA5Y If you're like me, you know you need to get more antioxidants in your daily diet - antioxidants are said to fight against cancer (by eliminating free radicals) and improve cell and heart functions: Jarrow POMGUARD provides 60 VEGETARIAN capsules as a dietary supplement, and includes 100% California Pomegranates.  And I absolutely ADORE pomegrantes, but they available for such a short period every year, so in the meantime (and if you don't eat up a bunch of blueberries instead), this is a great way to get your pomegranate OUT of Season :)...I would definitely recommend!
B0013OXA5Y If I had to name my favorite fruit, pomegranate would make it on the top of the list.  Some members of my family are mesmerized when I spend long time cleaning the big pomegranate fruit.  Others took more practical approach.  They bought me a special tool that cleans the fruit quickly  - but I still find it pleasant to clean it manually; it is almost a form of meditation.When I saw that Jarrow company offers product called PomGuard, I had to check it out.  This dietary supplement is made of 100% California pomegranate extract. Supplement comes in a capsule and it is easy to swallow with a little bit of water.  Directions indicate that one can take 1-2 capsules a day (morning and/or evening).  Pomegranate fruit contains powerful antioxidants.  This particular supplement helps promote cardiovascular function, it reduces oxidative damage from free radicals and supports healthy cell replication.I guess if there was any other way to make this supplement, I would like it to come in a chewable form.  One of the beauty of pomegranate fruit is its juicinesss, which is obviously missing when supplement comes in a form of a capsule.  However, I am still happy my body gets to enjoy the advantages of this heavenly fruit.
B0013OXA5Y I am biased because I like pomegrenate, the fruit itself, and thus I believe in its magic.  That said, I wish I were eating a pomegrenate instead of a tablet but until then, I'll pop this pill every day.
B0013OXA5Y Pomegranates - nature's wonder fruit. Used in traditional remedies for thousands of years, you'll find mention of Pomegranates in many ancient texts and religious writings. Pomegranates are way too expensive for my taste - or daily consumption. Same for the juice, plus there's all the sugars and calories in juice.  If you're looking for the benefits without the expense, calories and mess, this is an ideal option!  Plus since they are formulated using 100% American grown Pomegranates, you can be sure of the quality of the fruit.
B0013OXA5Y I really like supplements, which are derived from a food source, that give me extra nutrition.  As it isn't possible to eat in a single day all the things that keep one healthy, these supplements take the goodness of pomegranates and provide us with two important preventative benefits: antioxidants and heart health.  I felt great taking this product and I am sure it improved my health as well.
B0013OXA5Y I got this product because of all the benefits of antioxidants. Products like Pom Juice is very expensive so I figured I could get all of the benefits in a capsule form. I can't really tell a difference physically, but I'm confident that in the long run I will see the benefits. I finished one bottle and ordered a second. You can't beat the price when compared to the juices available.
B0013OXA5Y Jarrow Formulas Pomguard is a wonderful Antioxidant solution. PomGuard is a multifunctional supplement helping to support cardiovascular function (blood flow/heart health) as well as a strong antioxidant. Each capsule contains 425mg of Pomegranate Extract. You simply take one capsule a day and you're on your way to better health. It's definitely worth a try if you're looking a fruit supplement.
B0013OXA5Y Everyone, especially those who work out hard or have physically strenuous jobs, needs lots of anti-oxidants to keep their bodies healthy and strong. Pomegranate is one of the best whole food sources of a wide range of anti-oxidants, but the fruit is expensive, kind of a pain to eat, and not always to everyone's liking. Jarrow has concentrated all the benefits of pomegranate into this easy to swallow, and relatively (when compared to the actual fruit) inexpensive product. Having looked at other pomegranate anti-oxidant products, I believe this to be one of the best buys out of all of them considering strength, quality, and price.
B0013OXA5Y I'm not a big fan of taking extracts instead of consuming the actual food that they are derived from. In general, I'd rather eat an actual pomegranate than drink the juice or take a capsule. However, it is not practical to consume the fruit everyday. In fact, there are many foods with antioxidant qualities that are difficult to eat daily. In the case of pomegranates, there are two issues that make them a little harder to eat regularly. One is they are expensive. Another is that the fruit is a little troublesome to extract the edible arils from. In the past, I have purchased them and removed the arils only to find that sometimes they get moldy before I can eat them all and I've also found that I can have a strange digestive response to the seeds on occasion. This extract allows one to have the benefits without the potential problems.If you consider the average cost of a pomegranate, the cost of a 30-60-day (depending on if you take one or two capsules per day) is pretty reasonable as long as this is your main antioxidant supplement. Taking them is a pretty average experience for a supplement. However, these are in the middle of the pack price-wise and not the cheapest option. The capsules are neither too big nor small and are easy to swallow (though they are not specially coated, just normal clear capsules full of deep red powder). They do smell a bit chemical though. Frankly, they smell like glue, though you don't really taste anything or burp up anything odd after taking one (with food).The only down side is that pomegranates are delicious and that there is a loss of the seed nutrients (fiber, oils, micronutrients) if you choose an extract over the real deal.
B0013OXA5Y Admittedly, my family's diet doesn't have enough fruit in it. Due to the high cost of fresh fruit here and the fact that it goes bad nearly right after you bring it home we don't eat enough of it. I've been experimenting with vitamin therapy and these seem to help increase energy.For those that have a hard time taking pills, as I do, these are a normal sized capsule and they are easy to take.Overall, I'd recommend.
B0013OXA5Y Every so often, we are told of a new 'Superfood'.John Kellogg thought corn flakes were a superfood in the 1800s.Red is the new health color, pushing green aside...for the moment. I already take Jarrow anti-oxidant and Resveratrol formulas, so perhaps this is overkill. Still, can't hurt, might help!
B0013OXA5Y I've taken a lot of pomegranate pills over the years they help to keep me healthy. These work as well as any others I have taken and are easy to swallow.
B0013OXA5Y I drink POM and if you drink POM you know how expensive it is. This bottle is definitely worth the price to get the effects of pomegranate (in my opinion) I'd also rather take these than drink POM myself, as I'm not a fan of the taste. I like the brand Jarrow, is it my favorite? No, but this seemed to work fine for me.
B0013OXA5Y I ignored the whole pomegranate craze until recently.  On the East coast, I rarely ever see fresh pomegranates at my local grocery store.  The one time I did purchase one, it rotted before I could figure out how to open it and eat it.Over the last few months, my blood pressure has been creeping upward.  Whether that is due to gaining a few pounds or perhaps stress, I cannot say.  It is probably a combination of the two.  A friend had recently told me that pomegranates are supposed to be beneficial to blood pressure.  When I had the opportunity to try these Jarrows Formulas Pomguard tablets through the Amazon Vine program, I figured that I did not have anything to lose.I have been taking these for a month now.  At the beginning of the month, my blood pressure was averaging 150/90.  My readings for the last few days have been averaging 140/80.  I have not changed my diet or my non-existent exercise routine.  I have not lost weight.  The main source of my stress is still present (and snoring loudly) as well.  :)I can only guess that these Pomguard tablets are helping my blood pressure.  Of course, you should always listen to the advice of your physician regarding medical treatment and medications.  I intend to keep taking these for the long term.
B0013OXA5Y Jarrow is the perfect choice for supplements, because they provide superior quality products at an excellent price that don't disappoint. This potent Pomguard formula is not an exception. It delivers a high dose of antioxidants that work magic on the body. I personally love this product. Highly recommended for its potential health quality and reasonable price.
B0013OXA5Y Pomguard is a good supplement for increasing cardiovascular health and for slowing aging because of its antioxidant properties. It puts the healing power of pomegranates in concentrate. It is easier to use than eating promogranates themselves which have a lot of seeds. Drinking the juice is okay, but this supplement is better if you are looking to avoid fructose sugar intake. According to Dr. Mercola, fructose sugar is unhealthy beyond 25 grams a day.
B0013OXA5Y Pomegranates have recently been hailed as a super-food good for the heart/cardiovascular system as well as an excellent antioxidant. Pomegranate juice has suddenly become a big item in health food stores and groceries all across the country as a result. It seems the fruit itself isn't something people like to deal with, despite it actually being much easier to prepare for eating than the tons of seeds lead one to expect. It is also a seasonal fruit, and not a cheap fruit. The solution we've been provided is a capsule containing what are believed to be the most beneficial ingredients of the fruit, in particular ellagic acid, anthocyanins and ellagitannins. Most of the supplements currently available on the store shelves contain synthetic forms of these ingredients that are almost certainly inferior to the natural, straight-from-the-pomegranate forms. Even drinks advertised as pomegranate juice usually contain only a small amount of the real stuff, so read the labels before buying!It will be years before we know if pomegranates actually provide the benefits we now expect, but it has been a popular medicinal fruit for thousands of years in several cultures. This Jarrow product is the best of the pomegranate-derived supplements I've encountered to date, so I'm going to keep buying buying and taking it.
B0013OXA5Y I'm becoming a fan of the Jarrow Forumulas product line. So far I've been taking these for about two and a half weeks and zero issue. I'm a big fan of pomegranate juice in general so I get my fill of antioxidants both fresh and preserved. These Pomguard tablets are easy to swallow and so far, no side effects. I don't feel any extra burst of energy or anything hyperbolic like that, but nor have I had anything like upset stomachs or things of the sort.  So far, so good.
B0013OXA5Y What are pomegranates good for? Researchers report that they are rich in antioxidants that can keep bad LDL cholesterol from oxidizing. This degradation of LDL seems to be an initial step in the development of atherosclerosis. In addition, pomegranate extract, like aspirin, can help keep blood platelets from clumping together to form unwanted clots.Research has found that pomegranate extract improved the amount of oxygen getting to the heart muscle of patients with coronary heart disease. Other researchers report that long-term consumption of pomegranate extract may help combat E.D. Investigators are also excited about the possibility that pomegranate compounds might prevent prostate cancer or slow its growth. In mice, treatment with pomegranate extract delayed the development of tumors and improved survival Other research reports suggest that pomegranate juice might help reduce the risk of breast cancer. Arthritis may be hlped by this extract due to the reduction in inflammation that results.A little fun fact:The fruit features in Greek mythology in the story of Persephone, daughter of the harvest goddess Demeter. Hades, the lord of the underworld, kidnapped the beautiful maiden. Because she ate a few pomegranate seeds before being rescued, she had to spend several months every year in the underworld with him. According to the myth, that's when the earth was forced to endure winter. Persephone might have done better to resist eating pomegranate seeds, but science suggests that most of us could benefit!
B0013OXA5Y If you're reading this review, you probably already know that pomegranates are a potent source of many types of nutrients. It's hard to get and use fresh pomegranates, so if you're looking for a pomegranate supplement I can recommend this one. I can't address the results of taking it over time, but I do feel like it infuses my system with a wonderful antioxidant support and I trust Jarrow as a company. You get a high concentration of all the active portions of the pomegranate fruit.
B0013OXA5Y This is a great way to add pomengranates and their anti-oxidents to your diet. My stomach has felt better and I feel bet
B0013OXA5Y My husband and I take certain supplements every day for different needs.  We both have low blood pressure so we need to be careful with those supplements that can lower it even more.  Antioxidants are a good way to keep healthy but they can cause a decrease in blood pressure if taken in large doses.  The suggested dose is to take a capsule one or two times a day after a meal.  Each capsule contains 425mg of pomegranate extract.One capsule a day is enough for my husband and I take one capsule every other day.  This is the only way we can keep our blood pressure stable and yet get the benefit of the supplement.  This might mean that people with high blood pressure could benefit from the pomegranate extract.As with any other supplement, my recommendation is to do research before any purchase especially if considering taking this supplement in combination with others.
B0013OXA5Y I can't say with certainty but it seems like there is enough evidence out there that this supplement is beneficial to cardiac health.  Jarrow Formulas is a good brand that is well trusted.  The pills are easy to swallow for me and I have had no negative effects.  I am not sure if there are positive effects or not, but research encourages me to continue taking the product.
B0013OXA5Y Pomegranates are a well known source of antioxidants, however, many of us are not able to have an affordable supply of them throughout the year. PomGuard is a great substitute for those times when you can't get fresh pomegranates. In fact, it might even be better, because the whole fruit, including the juice, seed and peel is used, instead of just part of it.PomGuard is primarily taken for circulatory health, regulation of cholesterol, healthy blood platelets, normal cell function, and stimulating and supporting healthy cartilage life. As with most vitamins and supplements, it is best taken with a meal to avoid any stomach upset. I have not had any problems with off-taste, stomach upset or repeating while consuming these.PomGuard comes in easy to swallow Vegetarian (gelatin) capsules and are made from 100% California Pomegranates. I cannot find any information stating that these are organic or non-GMO.
B0013OXA5Y I chose to rate Jarrow Formulas Pomguard 5 stars because it is a great supplement. The company Jarrow seems to have placed a lot of research into this product, I love the formulationI also appreciate them not adding any additional \"fillers\" to the product, just 100% Pomegranate Extract. It is Wheat/Gluten/soy/dairy free and vegetarian/vegan friendly.I rotate this supplement with a few others to spread their benefits longer. For instance one day I'll take this supplement and another day i may take MK-7, another day I'll take Methyl B-12, etc.Overall, a great supplement for cardiovascular function, fights free radicals and supports heathly cells!
B0013OXA5Y Jarrow talks about the many possible health benefits of their PomGuard product. Among them are: healthy platelet activity, healthy levels of ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme), prostate, antioxidant, blood sugar, blood pressure, heart and arterial benefits, and more.Whether or not those can be substantiated is really a question that I cannot answer in this review.What I can tell you is that Jarrow's product provides the benefits of the entire pomegranate fruit - juice, seed, and peel. PomGuard's mixture of juice, peel and membrane and seed contains approximately 20% pure pomegranate seed lignins. The PomGuard capsule provides fruit extract from 100% California pomegranates, with nothing synthetic or artificial.I can also say that I've felt great since taking these daily. I simply cannot tell you - without a complete medical exam - whether they have actually contributed to all of the benefits ascribed to the product.
B0013OXA5Y I long ago discovered the wonderful taste of pomegranate during a visit to Israel.  It's one of their revered \"seven species\" of fruits/vegetables (along with olives, dates, etc).  In the process, I learned of the super health benefits of the fruit, especially its antioxidant properties.  Here in the Midwest, one cannot always readily buy a fresh pomegranate.  There are processed juices available, but those are often diluted and/or modified.  Now, this Jarrow Formulas Pomguard allows me easy access to the benefits of pomegranate daily, and at a reduced cost to buying the fresh fruit (granted, I'm missing the great taste experience).This supplement comes in the form of a typical clear capsule containing a brownish powder.  Recommended dose is one capsule one or two times daily after meals, with a capsule providing 425 mg of pomegranate extract from California pomegranates (and nothing else).  60 vegetarian friendly capsules per bottle. Contains no wheat, gluten, soybeans, dairy, eggs, fish, shellfish, peanuts, or nuts.  And Jarrow is a highly reputable manufacturer - I take several of their supplements.The label has a boilerplate \"consult your physician\" warning for people with medical conditions or taking medications.  ok.I have experienced no ill or other side effects after taking these.
B0013OXA5Y This is a great and easy supplement.  Once again Jarrow makes a quality product.  The research behind pomegranate is a little fuzzy and people use it for all types of conditions from breathing better to flu treatment to improved blood flow.  I find that it has a moderate breathing enhancement, but it is hard to say if that is weather related or not.  Either way, if you are looking for a pom supplement that is quick and easy, this one is for you.  Personal trial and opinion about what pom does for you is the best course of action.  I use it, I like it.  It helps me, maybe it will help you too.
B0013OXA5Y Good for keeping the blood pressure down. My bp has been creeping up in recent years but I believe that this, plus a couple of other supplements has helped bring it down. I absolutely love Jarrow Formulas, not only are they affordable, but also a very reliable brand.
B0013OXA5Y I've been taking these supplements daily for the last 3 weeks and while I can't report any miracles yet, I at least have no complaints either. I've used many supplements from Jarrow before and have trusted them to create high quality products. Pomguard is just as good as the others, in my opinion. The capsules are easy to swallow and digest without complaint.I decided to try taking pomegranate because of how soothed my stomach always felt after eating them. Unfortunately they're very expensive and not always in season, so I wondered if I'd feel the same with Pomguard. The effect is not quite the same, but I do believe I have better digestion after taking a capsule or two. I don't even know if Pomegranate is supposed to help digestion, I know they're allegedly good for many things, but that's how I've been using them. I also feel like I have a healthier urine flow, similar to the effects of cranberry juice. Perhaps my imagination, but so far everything is going well. I'm looking forward to continuing my routine to see if notice any other positive health benefits from taking pomegranate. If I discover anything really exciting, I'll be sure to update my review.
B0013OXA5Y I took this for a month and didn't see or feel any reactions, good or bad.  I don't think it would hurt a person to take this, so I feel it's a good supplement anyway.
B0013OXA5Y If you've never tried it, POM with milk, about 50/50 mix is heavenly.  It's like a milkshake.  But POM is expensive, and buying one bottle a week costs a lot.  Switching to tabs was great, saved me some money and I can still have my POM milkshake when I want.  Eating pomegranates raw is messy.  Takes a lot of time to suck on each seed and then spit them out.
B0013OXA5Y I have to admit, I'd never heard of Jarrow until recently when I started taking these and some vitamin B12. I'd always just gotten whatever was cheapest at Costco. In both cases I've been extremely impressed with the quality. The pills are easy to swallow the nutritional value high. A lot of times I don't care about it, but it was nice to see that it was made from California pomegranates; when it's something that is crushed up you never know what pesticides might be mixed in and at least coming from California you know it shouldn't be anything to heinous.I can't say I feel any different from these pills, but then again I wouldn't really expect to. They're mostly a preventative measure.  One of the purposes of antioxidants is to prevent the growth of cancer cells.  Antioxidants neutralize free radicals by providing the extra electron needed to make a pair or by simply breaking down the free radical molecule. In short, a healthy amount of antioxidants may help prevent you from getting cancer or other diseases or at least decrease your odds.  However, you don't have to much of a good thing or it could become dangerous. It should not take several these pills a day to try to become super healthy or something; you'll probably end up doing more harm than good.One thing you should be very careful about, is interaction with medicines. I have seen a couple of mentions that said that pomegranate may interfere with certain drugs you're taking the same way grapefruit can. If you're taking any kind of prescription medication, I would highly recommend that you actually ask your doctor before taking a supplement like this. Most likely he/she will say it's just fine, but it's better safe than sorry.The pills have no real taste and weren't bad to swallow, though even if you're like me and swallow most pills without water, you'll need some water with these.  Overall, I have no real complaints.  Nice product.
B0013OXA5Y Taking Jarrow Formulas Pomguard is a wonderful way to get the antioxidant power of pomegranates in a cost effective pill. Pomguard supports cardiovascular function, reduces oxidative damage by free radicals, and supports healthy cell replication and function.Like others who have posted reviews, I have been spending lots of money on pomegranate juice and love being able to get the same benefits for less money.Jarrow's products are top shelf products and I trust them completely.
B0013OXA5Y Pomegranate is reported as a pretty safe supplement to take. It is used for the flu, tapeworms, reversing atherosclerosis and for a few other conditions. I finished the bottle with no ill effects. People with food allergies may want to exercise caution if they have never been exposed to pomegranates. After researching this product I decided that although I feel it is a useful supplement, it is not going to be one that I keep in my routine.
B0013OXA8G I've been taking Jarrow formulas for years, this is a good product.  Phosphatydlserine is a fairly expensive supplement, and this one is one of the lowest priced one's I've found, in a good brand.
B0013OXA8G Serine is a bit harder to find in the diet.Definitely noticed calmer and more relaxed.  Not a great long term solution but feels good to take it.
B0013OXA8G Years ago, one of my physicians recommended I use this supplement.  I take it at night.  If you research the info on Phosphatidylserine, you'll find that it works at the cellular level and it especially good for brain function.
B0013OXA8G I've only heard good things about jarrow vitamins,  and this product hasnt changed my mind.Gave it to my mom,  but didnt see  any real differences from  when she was taking the &#34;now&#34; kind...I'm giving it 4 stars because I know jarrow is a good company.  Whether the stuff works,  I dunno,  as I didnt try it for me
B0013OXA8G Three months ago, I started taking these (1-3 daily) in addition toNature's Way Alive Once Daily Women's Multi Ultra Potency, Tablets, 60-Count, fish oil and extra vitamin D. I'm ~3/4 through my first (and very challenging) year of medical school now, and I've managed to stay healthy while everyone around me is getting run-down and sick. The PS-100, this Jarrow product SPECIFICALLY (I've tried a few) is noticeably effective at helping sustain my academic endurance.
B0013OXA8G I used to take gel caps but when this arrived I was surprised to see they were capsules. I didn't read carefully. However, I also found out that this product has little or no taste so I put it in my smoothie in the morning and I can't taste it. Now I don't have to swallow all those gel caps.
B0013OXABS &#2951; Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary:&#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150; Highly recommended with warm fuzzies!I first heard about Coenzyme Q10 in 2007 after reading Dr. Andrew Weil's book \"Healthy Aging\" and it really piqued my curiosity since CoQ10 has the unique ability to increase oxygen utilization in our cells.  Many people still have not heard about Coenzyme Q10 since it is far less publicized than the usual vitamins and minerals.  But in 1978, Peter Mitchell was awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry and part of the reason for the award was his discovery of how CoQ10 helps the mitochondria in our cells turn oxygen into energy.These soft-gel capsules are quite large in size, but I found them easy to swallow when washed down with a big gulp of water.  I have not felt any side effects from taking this supplement.  This is a very valuable supplement to take, especially as you age into your 40s, 50s, and beyond.  I highly recommend this supplement!
B0013OXABS You would honestly think that you were ingesting 1 gram of Ubiquinol when you see the gel cap!These are 3 times larger than the last 100mg Ubiquinol that I purchased. My wife refuses to take them.
B0013OXABS I'm a big fan of this product as it says that absorbs more quickly, and seems to imply more bioavailability.  I've been taking it it for a month and am very satisfied but admit I'm not sure how to evaluate the claims vs reality, but have no compliance data. I'm astifd
B0013OXABS Ubiquinol is an antioxidant found in almost every living cell and is essential for mitochondrial synthesis of energy.  It is manufactured by the human body but not in significant amounts so external supplementation is needed, especially as the body ages.  It effects cardiovascular health, neuronal metabolism, renal health, and genes related to lipid and lipoprotein metabolism and inflammation.  As for energy production, it aides in the production of ATP via signaling pathways and the genes relating to cholesterol, lipid and lipoprotein metabolism, which is anti-aging and improves cardiovascular health.  Studies have also shown that ubiquinol improved sperm density, motility, and morphology.  It was also shown to inhibit the release of proinflammatory substances, another cardiovascular disease potentiator. One problem is that CoEnzyme Q10 is not well absorbed by the body but in a comparison, ubiquinol exhibited significantly better bioavailablity than ubiquinone.  I take 400mg per day in divided doses and never miss a day!  I can not say if this formulation is better than any of the others I have tried but this company  has an excellent reputation.
B0013OXABS Jarrow Formulas Ubiquinol QH-Absorb appears to be a form of highly absorbable and effective Co-Enzyme Q-10, which is what, in powdered form, I have been giving (for years) to my Cee Cee cat who has a very definite heart murmur. At 13, she still scurries around, jumps and plays -- so Co-Q10 may be contributing to HER health.However, she's NOT getting MY Jarrow Formulas Ubiquinol QH-Absorb, which although a large softgel, IS a softgel easy to swallow, which means it is highly absorbable in the body where it counts -- the stomach, and possibly the gut.Jarrow Formulas Ubiquinol QH-Absorb has been tested and researched on a control group of people whose results after the study, proved to be positive. I couldn't agree more with this conclusion -- as Co-Q10, formerly a highly underrated/unknown supplement, seems to be exactly what the world needs today for heart health.in addition, \"After about age 45, total Q levels and QH levels tend to decline in various critical tissues.\" And after age 45, we have more than enough stressors to our lives and health to worry about -- it appears the Jarrow Formulas Ubiquinal Qh-Absorb is just what is needed for quick absorption in \"older\" bodies.I have a mild heart murmur -- heart trouble ran in my family. So perhaps Jarrow Formulas Ubiquinol QH-Absorb is just the ticket for my ticker. I continue to take it every day. The price is reasonable, given the healthful effects it appears to produce in the body.Thank you Jarrow, for your research, studies, and the efficacy and purity of your products.
B0013OXABS I have taken Co-Enzyme Q10 for many years, it is an important enzyme for cellular health. Our bodies don't make as much of it as we age. It is important for heart health and oral health as well. A good toothpaste and oral rinse will include Co-Q10 (like PerioBrite, TheraBreath, PerioTherapy and others, you can find all of these on Amazon) as well. Ubiquinol is the advanced form of Co-Q10, which doesn't require the body to break it down so it is more easily absorbed. Qbiquinol is generally more expensive than Co-Q10 (which can be expensive for the higher potency formulas). This is an excellent formula of Ubiquinol. It has a fast absorption and enhanced stability so that you get the full benefit must faster. It is gluten free but does have soy. Jarrow is a high quality vitamin manufacturer that makes excellent products. They focus on creating the proper formulas for their vitamin supplements to enhance absorption and usability. I have used their products before. Ubiquinol is beneficial for us as we hit our 30s and beyond. If you have diabetes, high blood pressure or other conditions, this product can be very beneficial for you. Many good doctors will recommend Co-Q10 and Qbiquinol to their patients. If you have never tried Co-Q10 or Qbiquinol before, you may wish to start with a lower dose of Co-Q10 first and work your way up. If you have conditions as mentioned before, higher formulas will be beneficial. This is an important product to add to your health regimen, just as important as fish oil, Vitamin C or calcium. I highly recommend this product. It has helped to give me more energy and is excellent for heart health. Be sure to take this with a meal and not on an empty stomach. It is even more effective with exercise and a good diet. While we can't always eat right, I do make sure I take my vitamin supplements and hit the gym for exercise.
B0013OXABS Having tried out many of their supplements over the years, and having taken one on a daily basis for years, I have come to trust Jarrow Formulas.  I have taken cholesterol medication for many years, and my doctor has adamantly recommended that I take 100mg of CoQ10 each day with my cholesterol pill so I don't lose energy and become sluggish.  I have purchased a wide variety of CoQ10 supplements over the years, different brands and strengths, usually looking for the best value.Jarrow Forumlas Ubiquinol QH-Absorb provides the benefits of 100mg of CoQ10, suggesting that this formula works better and is absorbed faster by your body.  Both online and in very small print on the bottle, Jarrow provides all kinds of information on how and why this Ubiquinol formula works, and I am not someone who is inclined to study this at length.  If there is something I need to take, recommended by my doctor, I look for the best and most affordable version I can find.  This formula is not the most affordable, but I have to say that, after a couple of weeks, it seems to work just as well as my generic store-brand CoQ10 capsules.  I won't likely know until my next round of blood work if there is any change to my cholesterol, but if - like me - you are pretty much required to take CoQ10 every day, you may want to give this a try to see if it helps.
B0013OXABS I'd like to write a good review for these vitamins, but the truth is I noticed an increase in headaches once I started taking them. Once I stopped, no more headaches!Something doesn't work for me in these vitamins, but your mileage may vary.
B0013OXABS Ubiquinal is a reduced form of Co-Q10. What that means in simple terms is that it is the reduced active antioxidant state of Co-Q10. This is the type made by cells in the body and is much better absorbed than regular Co-Q10, especially as people age.As it says on the bottle, \"Jarrow Formulas QH-absorb is a proprietary enhanced stability formula, which has been clinically shown in humans to increase Co-Q10 levels up to 777% (6.14X) over baseline at 300 mg per day intake.\"This sounds good to me. These are very big black pills. Serving size, as stated on the bottle, is one per day.Each softgel contains 100mg of Ubiquinol (Kaneka QH). Kaneka QH is a registered trademark of the Kaneka Corporation of Japan.The bottle states that these are gluten free. Other ingredients as stated are: Medium chain trigycerides, phosphatidylcholine (from soy lecithin), beeswax, rosmarinic acid, vitamin E, and ascorbyl palm itate. Softget consists of gelatin, glycerin and water. Carob extract and caramel added. Contains: Soy.Ubiquinol is a fat soluable substance, meaning it must have fat to be absorbed. I take these with my fattiest meal of the day, to hopefully have as much absorbed as possible. Who knew that the Co-Q10 I've been taking all these years wasn't being absorbed well? I didn't!I take over 12 supplements a day, and Co-Q10 has been one of the leading ones I've always taken. I feel that this particular blend from Jarrow will probably be much better absorbed than regular Co-Q10, particularly when I take it with food that has some fat in it. I like the Jarrow brand, since I've known and trusted them for years.
B0013OXABS I first tried DR. Mercola's brand Ubiquinol enhanced CoQ10 about a year ago. I never felt wow energy improvement but I did feel more awake and honestly lighter on my feet. I truly felt \"airy\" if that even makes sense. I noticed a differnce any time that I took them. My memory is not fantastic so I decided to get more and wanted to try the Jarrow brand.. really I got free shipping and two day delivery for free. Plus, the reviews we're great. Well, I have yet to notice any difference in energy or anything else since taking them.  I've been taking them for a week and nothing.I'm 29 years old and take prEtty good care of my health amd am very natural minded so I'm disappointed.  I read that mercola,'s formulation was the bestand now I agree.  Ill be sticking to his brand from now on.
B0013OXABS Not sure if this stuff works well or not as I don't know how to tell. These pills are ginormous. I take 3 a day. They are smooth, black, and really do go down easy. No side effects that I can tell. I take them per regiment suggested by Dr. Steven Sinatra for blood pressure issues.
B0013OXABS I've been taking some form of CoQ10 for several years for its cardiovascular and energizing benefits.  When sourcing CoQ10 (ubiquinol) it's vitally important to get a type that is actually ABSORBED into your bloodstream.  This form is highly absorbable.I like this higher 100 mg dosage of ubiquinol & can definitely feel a difference in energy levels on the days I take it.  This supplement is DEFINITELY on my list of favorites; highly recommended for its quality and effectiveness.See this book by Dr. Stephen Sinatra to learn what you need to know about CoQ10's importance to your health:Reverse Heart Disease Now: Stop Deadly Cardiovascular Plaque Before It's Too Late.  Good luck and good health to all!
B0013OXABS Everything I've read about this product I wanted....all the health benefits. I was eager to try it.  Unfortunately, after each dosage I got the worst, chest crushing heartburn ever.  I thought maybe it was something else, and experimented with taking it on an empty AND full stomach, as well as at different times of day.  I also ruled out other medication or foods that might have caused the heartburn.Still, no better.  Something about this doesn't agree with me and the pain of the heartburn couldn't be ignored. I had to stop taking it.
B0013OXABS I've been taking this for awhile and I feel a bit more alert, not miraculously but some.I've known and understood the profound benefits of Co-Q10 for several years now and also paid quite a bit more for it.  \"Ubiquinol QH\" is touted as a \"reduced form\" of Co-Q10-- not quite sure what that means.  Does it mean half the strength (so take double the amount for the effects of Co-Q10)?A very large \"soft\" pill that digests very easily.Good product.
B0013OXABS CO Q10 has been highly touted for some time to be an extraordinarily beneficial supplement.The additional Ubiquinol QH absorb Jarrow formula takes it a step further in providing an additional path to absorption, particularly as the user gets older.It has been stated that absorption levels decline with age.With that in mind, it is anticipated that this formula will be more beneficial.Cons are the price but every CO Q10 formula, worth its 'salt', has been pricey.
B0013OXABS Ubiquinol is a more readily absorbed by the body CoQ10 supplement. According to Wikipedia, it is available from food, but declines with age. According to scientific studies it is antiaging, helps prevent Alzheimer's, and helps the heart and also energy levels in older adults. That is why I take it. You can learn more about it at Wikipedia. I know that Jarrow is a reputable company and they offered a great price on this product, like $30.00 less a bottle than I had been paying. I am very happy with this product.
B0013OXABS Ubiquinol is a form of Coenzyme Q-10 that is better absorbed. Clinical studies have found that it holds great promise in improving cardiovascular, renal and oral health as well as male fertility. It improves energy and may help in slowing the aging process.I found the soft gels easy to swallow with no discernible side effects. At this juncture it is hard to guage any benefits. Overall Jarrow is a reliable company that produces high quality products. I do feel bet
B0013OXABS I have been taking this cardiovascularly protective supplement for years and will continue to do so.  Great product, easy to swallow gel cap.
B0013OXABS For the most part, I've been happy with products I've tried from Jarrow. Lately I've been taking things that I don't even really need just to see if they help me out in any way. To be honest, I didn't even know what Ubiquinol was until I got my package in the mail. Energy isn't a problem of mine, though there are days when I'm not feeling all that lively, regardless of how much sleep I had the night before. I started taking a dose of Ubiquinol each day, and haven't noticed any side effects, or any real benefits for that matter aside from the fact that I haven't been having any of those \"down' days any more. This could be in part to me exercising more regularly than I was at the start of the year (I started taking Ubiquinol at the end of February), so I can't say for sure.As it is, the pills are easy to swallow with water, don't have any strange taste to them, and the fact that you're getting some good CoQ-10 in here, which aids blood flow and lets more oxygen get to your brain, and you've got a nice little supplement. Some people I know who've tried this stuff have mentioned that it makes them more alert and awake soon after taking it. Keep that in mind so you don't take a dose a little bit before bedtime or anything.
B0013OXABS Jarrow is a fine company, and they always produce high quality products. I highly recommend this product. My only complaint, if you can call it that, is that I would really love to buy these in a 300 mg soft gel. Right now I take 3 soft gels per day, so I would love the convenience of a larger dose.
B0013OXABS How can you judge how well a supplement is working? You can't! However, I have read that Ubiquinol is better than regular CoQ10 in general and I have trusted Jarrow over a few years, so I have nothing bad to say.
B0013OXABS There are rave reviews and suggestions we should take these to maintain heart health.  My husband and I take these on a daily basis but have stopped taking supplements except calcium, d, c, and multivitamins to see if ubiquinol is one of the causes for his headache.  I haven't had a health check up so I'm not sure if this supplement helps or not.  I'm in my late 30's with good health for the most part.  For better health the best thing you can do is eat right and exercise.  Supplements can be expensive and visiting the docs.
B0013OXABS I really like this brand of Ubiquinol.  Very high quality and would highly recommend if you are looking for something to try.
B0013OXABS This ubiquinol is a nice product at a good price.As people get older, their natural supply of coq10 drops, and they have difficulty converting coq10 to ubiquinol, which is an important to help produce cellular energy and to fight free radicals.  In fact, some benefits of ubiquinal are supposedly:  heart health, anti-aging, blood pressure reduction, fight free-radicals, boost immune system and support nervous system, much of this supported by various scientific literature.  Ubiquinol can be directly absorbed, and hence there is some literature stating that people over age 40 should consider supplementing with it.I can't speak to all the alleged health claims, but I can say that I do _think_ I have more energy due to the ubiquinol supplementation.The Jarrow pills are a decent size and swallow easily.  The price is good.  What's not to like?
B0013OXABS When it comes to taking supplements, my stomach usually says \"no!\"  In addition to this, there are many foods that I can't eat so I am always searching for new products that could help me and not throw my stomach into a turmoil.Thus far I have not been disappointed by Ubiquinol QH-Absorb 100 mg, 60 Softgels.  At the present time, I am only taking one per day but I have noticed that I have more energy.  In time, I will increase the dosage and see what happens. Give this product a try; I believe it will make a difference. Believe me, my stomach could get a job as a vitamin or supplement tester. But everyone is different so check with your health provider.
B0013OXABS I've been taking this for several weeks and have noticed that my energy level is at a consistently higher level. In addition, QH-absorb(the reduced form of Co-Q10) has been shown to improve heart health and function(as well as to lower blood pressure). There are other various immune and antioxidant benefits but the supplement needs be taken consistently and over a long period in order to attain the beneficial results.
B0013OXABS CoQ10 is a top supplement that probably everyone over 40 should take. This is a very good price per dose and Jarrow products are always high quality.
B0013OXABS I consider this to one of the of key supplements on my must take daily list. Coenzyme q10 is essential for optimal cell function and decreases as we age. If you are taking a cholesterol lowering drug it is even more important to take as statins lower the amount of CQ10 the liver makes. The Ubiquinol version is superior in that it allows your body to actually absorb the stuff more efficiently. So to summarize, if you've decided to supplement with coq10, this is the product to take. It may be a little more expensive but you are more likely to get the benefits in this form.
